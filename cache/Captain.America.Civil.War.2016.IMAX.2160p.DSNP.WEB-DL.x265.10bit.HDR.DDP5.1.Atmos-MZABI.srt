1
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,480
Longing

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Rusted

3
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Seventeen

4
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Daybreak

5
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,360
Furnace

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Nine

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,680
Benign

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
Homecoming

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,560
One

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,560
Freight car

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,960
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,240
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
No witnesses.

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Well done Soldier.

17
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
All right, what do you see?

18
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,000
Small station.

20
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,280
Quiet street.

21
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,240
It's a good target.

22
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

23
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
Cameras.

24
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
Both cross streets
are one-way.

25
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
So, compromised escape routes.

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,920
STEVE: Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,040
He isn't afraid
to make a mess
on the way out.

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,080
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

29
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah, the red one?
It's cute.

30
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,440
It's also bulletproof,

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,760
which means
private security...

32
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,240
which means more guns...

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,880
which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.

34
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,520
You guys know
I can move things
with my mind, right?

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

36
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,600
NATASHA: Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,960
STEVE: Eyes on target, folks.

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
in six months.
I don't want to lose him.

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,480
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
He kind of hates us.

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Sam...

44
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
see that garbage truck?

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Tag it.

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,320
Give me X-ray.

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,160
That truck's loaded
for max weight.

48
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
And the driver's armed.

49
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
It's a battering ram.

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
STEVE: Go now.
What?

51
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
He's not hitting the police.

52
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Body armor, AR-15s.

53
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
I make seven hostiles.

54
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,160
I make five.

55
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Sam.

56
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
Four.

57
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
Rumlow's on the third floor.

58
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
Wanda, just like
we practiced.

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
WANDA: What about the gas?

60
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,960
Get it out.

61
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
CROSSBONES: Pack it up.

62
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,600
CROSSBONES: He's here.

63
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Rumlow has
a biological weapon.

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm on it.

65
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,320
I don't work
like that no more.

66
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Fire in the hole.

67
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,240
MERC: No!

68
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
Sam.

69
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,400
He's in an AFV
heading north.

70
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Take this to
the airstrip.

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

72
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
Where are you
going to meet us?

73
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm not.

74
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,480
I've got four,
they're splitting up.

75
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
I got the two on the left.

76
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
They ditched their gear.

77
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,600
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

78
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,600
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

79
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,920
I've been waiting for this.

80
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,480
He doesn't have it.

81
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm empty!

82
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,480
Out of the way!

83
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Drop it.

84
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Or I'll drop this.

85
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Drop it!
He'll do it!

86
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,200
Payload secure.
Thanks, Sam.

87
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Don't thank me.

88
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm not thanking that thing.

89
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
His name is Redwing.

90
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm still not thanking it.

91
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

92
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
Come on!

93
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,040
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

94
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Ahh!

95
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

96
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Who's your buyer?

97
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,440
You know, he knew you.

98
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,720
Your pal, your buddy,
your Bucky.

99
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
What did you say?

100
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
He remembered you.

101
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
I was there.
He got all weepy about it.

102
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Till they put his brain
back in a blender.

103
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,120
He wanted you
to know something.

104
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
He said to me...

105
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,840
"Please tell Rogers.

106
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
"When you gotta go...

107
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
"you gotta go."

108
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,120
And you're coming with me.

109
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,720
Oh, my...

110
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,760
Sam...

111
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,960
we need Fire and Rescue

112
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,640
on the south side
of the building.

113
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
We gotta get up there.

114
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,240
the kind of September

115
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,480
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye
to your father.

116
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,280
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

117
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,800
This is why
I love coming home
for Christmas...

118
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
right before
you leave town.

119
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,680
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

120
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

121
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
Candice.

122
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,760
Do me a favor?

123
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Try not to burn
the house down
before Monday.

124
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,680
Okay, so it's Monday.

125
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,040
That is good to know,

126
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
I will plan my toga party
accordingly.

127
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,840
Where you going?

128
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,080
Your father's flying us

129
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,520
to the Bahamas
for a little getaway.

130
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,200
We might have to make
a quick stop.

131
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,440
At the Pentagon. Right?

132
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Don't worry,
you're gonna love

133
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
the holiday menu
at the commissary.

134
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,440
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

135
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

136
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll get the bags.

137
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
He does miss you
when you're not here.

138
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,840
And frankly,
you're going to miss us.

139
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,280
Because this is
the last time

140
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,960
we're all going
to be together.

141
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,280
You know
what's about to happen.

142
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Say something.

143
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,360
If you don't,
you'll regret it.

144
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
I love you, Dad.

145
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
And I know you did
the best you could.

146
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,800
That's how I wish
it happened.

147
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,840
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing...

148
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,040
or BARF.

149
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
God, I gotta work
on that acronym.

150
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
An extremely
costly method

151
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
of hijacking
the hippocampus...

152
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
clear traumatic memories.

153
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
Huh.

154
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
It doesn't change the fact

155
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,920
that they never
made it to the airport...

156
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,840
or all the things
I did to avoid

157
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
processing my grief, but...

158
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

159
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,680
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

160
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,520
Help me out, what's the
MIT mission statement?

161
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
"To generate, disseminate...

162
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,760
"and preserve knowledge.

163
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
"And work with others...

164
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,960
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

165
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,800
Well, you are the others.

166
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
And, quiet as it's kept...

167
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,080
the challenges facing you

168
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,560
are the greatest
mankind's ever known.

169
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
Plus, most of you are broke.

170
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
Oh, I'm sorry.
Rather, you were.

171
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
As of this moment...

172
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,240
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

173
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,320
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

174
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,920
As in...

175
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

176
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,760
No strings, no taxes...

177
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,080
just reframe the future!

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Starting now.

179
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Go break some eggs.

180
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,240
Wow. Wow.

181
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,040
That took my breath away.

182
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, Tony!
So generous.

183
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,960
So much money! Wow!

184
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,880
Out of curiosity...

185
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,840
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

186
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,280
I know, "Ooh, gross,"
but hear me out.

187
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

188
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,760
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

189
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Restroom's this way, yeah?

190
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
Yeah. Embedded
in the meat shaft.

191
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,480
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

192
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,960
I didn't know Miss Potts
had canceled.

193
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
They didn't have time
to fix it.

194
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
It's fine.
I'll be right back.

195
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,960
We'll catch up later.

196
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,920
That was nice,
what you did for
those young people.

197
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,080
Ah, they deserve it.

198
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
Plus, it helps ease
my conscience.

199
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,600
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

200
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,240
But if you've got the money...

201
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
break as many eggs
as you like.

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
Right?

203
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Are you going up?

204
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm right where
I want to be.

205
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Okay. Hey.

206
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,560
Sorry,
it's an occupational hazard.

207
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,360
I work for
the State Department.

208
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,800
Human Resources.

209
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
I know it's boring...

210
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,640
but it enabled me
to raise a son.

211
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
I'm very proud
of what he grew up to be.

212
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,920
His name was Charlie Spencer.

213
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,520
You murdered him.

214
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,720
In Sokovia.

215
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,280
Not that that matters
in the least to you.

216
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,440
You think you fight for us?

217
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,840
You just fight for yourself.

218
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,560
Who's going to
avenge my son, Stark?

219
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
He's dead...

220
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,960
and I blame you.

221
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
11 Wakandans were

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,960
among those killed
during a confrontation...

223
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,280
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...

224
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,400
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
The traditionally reclusive
Wakandans

226
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,320
were on an outreach mission...

227
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
in Lagos,
when the attack occurred.

228
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,600
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...

229
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,360
not only because of
the actions of criminals...

230
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,360
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.

231
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,400
Victory at the expense
of the innocent...

232
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,000
is no victory at all.

233
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,640
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: The
Wakandan king went on to...

234
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,320
They are operating outside

235
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,160
and above
the international law.

236
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Because that's the reality,

237
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,120
if we don't respond
to acts like these.

238
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
What legal authority
does an enhanced

239
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,120
individual like
Wanda Maximoff have...

240
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,560
to operate in Nigeri...?

241
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,640
It's my fault.

242
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
That's not true.

243
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Turn the TV back on.

244
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
They're being very specific.

245
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,800
I should've clocked
that bomb vest

246
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,840
long before you had
to deal with it.

247
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,600
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

248
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,920
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,

249
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,080
in Brooklyn.

250
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,920
And people died.

251
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
It's on me.

252
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
It's on both of us.

253
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,840
This job...

254
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,840
We try to save
as many people as we can.

255
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,520
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

256
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,600
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

257
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,680
then next time...

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
maybe nobody gets saved.

259
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Vis! We talked about this.

260
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,640
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

261
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr. Stark was arriving.

262
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,040
Thank you.
We'll be right down.

263
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,720
I'll use the door.

264
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,040
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

265
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
STEVE: We know who it is?

266
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,880
The Secretary of State.

267
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,720
SECRETARY ROSS:
 Five years ago...

268
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,000
I had a heart attack...

269
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,320
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

270
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...

271
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,720
because after
13 hours of surgery

272
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,560
and a triple bypass...

273
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,400
I found something 40 years

274
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,360
in the Army
had never taught me.

275
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,240
Perspective.

276
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,240
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

277
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
You have fought for us...

278
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
protected us,
risked your lives...

279
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,520
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

280
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
there are some...

281
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
who would prefer
the word "vigilantes."

282
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,520
What word would you use,
Mr. Secretary?

283
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
How about "dangerous"?

284
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,280
What would you call
a group of US-based,

285
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
enhanced individuals...

286
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

287
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,400
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

288
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
and who, frankly,
seem unconcerned

289
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,120
about what they leave behind?

290
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,640
New York.

291
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,240
Washington, D.C.

292
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,800
Sokovia.

293
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Lagos.

294
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,680
Okay. That's enough.

295
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,920
For the past four years,

296
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,360
you've operated with
unlimited power...

297
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
and no supervision.

298
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

299
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
can no longer tolerate.

300
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,280
But I think
we have a solution.

301
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,360
The Sokovia Accords.

302
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,640
Approved by 117 countries...

303
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,680
it states that the Avengers

304
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
shall no longer be
a private organization.

305
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
Instead...

306
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,040
they'll operate
under the supervision

307
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,040
of a United Nations panel...

308
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,680
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

309
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,720
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

310
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
I feel we've done that.

311
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,640
Tell me, Captain,
do you know

312
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
where Thor and Banner
are right now?

313
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,520
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

314
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,000
you can bet
there'd be consequences.

315
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,680
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

316
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,720
Believe me,
this is the middle ground.

317
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,480
So, there are contingencies.

318
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

319
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
to ratify the Accords.

320
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
Talk it over.

321
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
And if we come
to a decision
you don't like?

322
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,440
Then you retire.

323
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
MAN: Hello?

324
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,440
Is this your car
out front?

325
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,880
I jumped the curb.

326
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,520
Maybe we could...

327
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,640
take care of it ourselves.

328
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

329
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,440
I guess.
No.

330
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
No cops.

331
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Thank you.

332
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,840
You have kept
your looks, Colonel.

333
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Congratulations.

334
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
"Mission report.
December 16, 1991."

335
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
Who are you?

336
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,280
My name is Zemo.

337
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,640
I will repeat my question.

338
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,160
Mission report,
December 16, 1991.

339
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,120
How did you find me?

340
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,200
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

341
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,880
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

342
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,720
Millions of pages.
Much of it encrypted.

343
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,520
Not easy to decipher.

344
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,720
But, I have experience.

345
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,200
And patience.

346
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
A man can do anything
if he has those.

347
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
What do you want?

348
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,000
Mission report.

349
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
December 16.

350
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,720
1991.

351
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,720
Go... to... hell!

352
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,320
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

353
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,360
So your death
would not bother me.

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,920
But I'd have to use
this book...

355
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,600
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

356
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,960
I don't look forward to that.

357
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,760
You'd only be dying for...

358
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,400
your pride.

359
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,600
Hail HYDRA.

360
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
Secretary Ross has

361
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
a Congressional
Medal of Honor...

362
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,720
which is one more
than you have.

363
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,560
SAM: So let's say
we agree to this thing.

364
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,560
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

365
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,920
like a bunch
of common criminals?

366
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,120
117 countries
want to sign this.

367
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,840
117, Sam,
and you're just like,

368
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
"No, that's cool.
We got it."

369
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
How long are you going
to play both sides?

370
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
I have an equation.

371
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Oh, this will
clear it up.

372
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,560
In the eight years
since Mr. Stark

373
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
announced himself
as Iron Man...

374
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,320
the number of known
enhanced persons

375
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,760
has grown exponentially.

376
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
During the same period...

377
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,920
the number of potentially
world-ending events

378
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
has risen
at a commensurate rate.

379
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
Are you saying
it's our fault?

380
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm saying there may be
a causality.

381
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,680
Our very strength
invites challenge.

382
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
Challenge incites conflict.

383
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,320
And conflict...

384
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
breeds catastrophe.

385
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,680
Oversight...

386
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

387
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Boom.

388
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,360
NATASHA: Tony.

389
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,840
You are being
uncharacteristically

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
non-hyperverbal.

391
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,520
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

392
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Boy, you know me so well.

393
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,200
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

394
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,720
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

395
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
It's discomfort.

396
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

397
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,960
Am I running a bed and
breakfast for a biker gang?

398
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, that's Charles Spencer,
by the way.

399
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,360
He's a great kid.

400
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,880
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

401
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,720
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

402
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,400
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

403
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,080
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

404
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
Maybe be of service.

405
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
Charlie didn't want
to go to Vegas or

406
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

407
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,240
He didn't go to
Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

408
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,360
He decided to
spend his summer

409
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,000
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

410
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,640
Guess where. Sokovia.

411
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,760
He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.

412
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
We won't know
because we dropped

413
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,560
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

414
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,360
There's no decision-making
process here.

415
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,360
We need to be put in check!

416
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,880
Whatever form that takes,
I'm game.

417
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,120
If we can't accept
limitations,

418
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
if we're boundary-less...

419
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,440
we're no better
than the bad guys.

420
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,040
Tony, someone dies
on your watch,
you don't give up.

421
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Who said we're giving up?

422
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
We are if we're not
taking responsibility
for our actions.

423
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
This document
just shifts the blame.

424
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm sorry, Steve.

425
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,280
That is dangerously arrogant.

426
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,480
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

427
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,880
It's not the
World Security Council,

428
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,200
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D.,
it's not HYDRA.

429
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,640
No, but it's run by people

430
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,120
with agendas,
and agendas change.

431
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
That's good.
That's why I'm here.

432
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,400
When I realized
what my weapons

433
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,760
were capable of
in the wrong hands...

434
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,520
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

435
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,920
Tony, you chose to do that.

436
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,960
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

437
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,040
What if this panel
sends us somewhere

438
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,320
we don't think we should go?

439
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,760
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

440
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,960
and they don't let us?

441
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,640
We may not be perfect,

442
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,440
but the safest hands
are still our own.

443
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
If we don't do this now,

444
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,800
it's gonna be
done to us later.

445
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,840
That's the fact.
That won't be pretty.

446
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,160
You're saying
they'll come for me.

447
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
We would protect you.

448
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,680
NATASHA: Maybe Tony's right.

449
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,160
If we have one hand
on the wheel,

450
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,360
we can still steer.
If we take it off...

451
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,160
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

452
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,760
to kiss her ass
a few years ago?

453
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm just reading the terrain.

454
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,640
We have made some
very public mistakes.

455
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
We need to win
their trust back.

456
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,120
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

457
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,280
or did you agree with me?
I want to take it back now.

458
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,440
No, you can't retract it.

459
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,480
Thank you.
Unprecedented.

460
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
Okay. Case closed. I win.

461
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,520
I have to go.

462
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,160
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

463
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
to come up
and say a few words.

464
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,160
Margaret Carter
was known to most

465
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,760
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

466
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,880
but I just knew her
as Aunt Peggy.

467
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,080
She had a photograph
in her office.

468
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Aunt Peggy
standing next to JFK.

469
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,120
As a kid,
that was pretty cool.

470
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,720
But it was a lot
to live up to.

471
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,280
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

472
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,680
I asked her once
how she managed

473
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,680
to master diplomacy
and espionage...

474
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,320
in a time when
no one wanted to see

475
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,200
a woman succeed at either.

476
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
She said,
compromise where you can.

477
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,640
But where you can't, don't.

478
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,840
Even if everyone
is telling you

479
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,080
that something wrong
is something right.

480
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,520
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

481
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,320
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

482
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,960
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

483
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,840
When I came
out of the ice,

484
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,320
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,280
Then I found out
she was alive.

486
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,800
I was just lucky
to have her.

487
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
She had you back, too.

488
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,680
Who else signed?

489
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,280
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

490
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Clint?

491
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
Says he's retired.

492
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
Wanda?
TBD.

493
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing
of the Accords.

494
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,800
There's plenty of room
on the jet.

495
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,520
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

496
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,880
doesn't mean
it's the wrong path.

497
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,400
Staying together
is more important

498
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
than how we stay together.

499
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,880
What are we
giving up to do it?

500
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,360
I'm sorry, Nat.

501
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,200
I can't sign it.

502
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
I know.

503
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
Then what are
you doing here?

504
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,680
I didn't want you
to be alone.

505
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,560
Come here.

506
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,080
MALE NEWS ANCHOR: At a special
United Nations conference...

507
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
117 countries
have come together

508
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,480
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

509
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,960
UN STAFFER: Excuse me,
Ms. Romanoff?

510
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,640
NATASHA: Yes?
These need your signature.

511
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,680
Thank you.
Thanks.

512
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,320
T'CHALLA: I suppose
neither of us

513
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,160
is used to the spotlight.

514
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,600
Oh, well, it's not always
so flattering.

515
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,080
You seem to be doing
all right so far.

516
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,600
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

517
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,680
I wouldn't think
you'd be particularly

518
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,600
comfortable in this company.

519
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,800
Well, I'm not.

520
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,720
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms. Romanoff.

521
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,680
Why? You don't approve
of all this?

522
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,200
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

523
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,120
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

524
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,560
Unless you need
to move a piano.

525
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,120
Ms. Romanoff.

526
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
King T'Chaka.

527
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,200
Please, allow me to apologize
for what happened in Nigeria.

528
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,920
Thank you.

529
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,440
Thank you for agreeing
to all of this.

530
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,200
I'm sad to hear
that Captain Rogers

531
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,720
will not be joining us today.

532
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,120
Yes, so am I.

533
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,800
If everyone could
please be seated.

534
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
This assembly
is now in session.

535
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,760
That is the future calling.

536
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,760
Such a pleasure.

537
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,240
Thank you.

538
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,840
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,

539
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,440
you're getting quite good at it.

540
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,600
I'm happy, Father.

541
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,640
Thank you.

542
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Thank you.

543
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,760
KING T'CHAKA: When stolen
Wakandan vibranium

544
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,760
was used to make
a terrible weapon...

545
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,800
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.

546
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,680
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

547
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,760
were part of
a goodwill mission

548
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,000
from a country too long
in the shadows.

549
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,440
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

550
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

551
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,960
I am grateful
to the Avengers

552
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,600
for supporting
this initiative.

553
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,680
Wakanda is proud

554
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,680
to extend its hand in peace.

555
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Everybody get down!

556
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,800
SHARON: My mom tried to
talk me out of enlisting...

557
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

558
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,760
She bought me
my first thigh holster.

559
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,560
Very practical.

560
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,280
And stylish.

561
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
CIA has you stationed
over here now?

562
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,160
Berlin.
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

563
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,600
Right. Right.
Sounds fun.

564
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,680
I know, right?

565
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,480
I've been meaning
to ask you.

566
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

567
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
You mean when I was
doing my job.

568
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,440
Did Peggy know?

569
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
She kept so many secrets.

570
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,280
I didn't want her
to have one from you.

571
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,120
Thanks for walking me back.

572
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,640
Sure.

573
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,320
SAM: Steve.

574
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,280
There's something
you gotta see.

575
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
MALE NEWS ANCHOR:
A bomb hidden
in a news van...

576
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,400
SHARON: Who's coordinating?

577
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.

578
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,600
Good. They're solid.
Forensics?

579
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
More than 70 people
have been injured.

580
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,280
At least 12 are dead,

581
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,640
including Wakanda's
King T'Chaka.

582
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,640
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...

583
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,240
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...

584
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,800
the Winter Soldier.

585
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
The infamous HYDRA agent...

586
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,040
linked to numerous
acts of terrorism

587
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,560
and political assassinations.

588
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,240
I have to go to work.

589
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,560
Call MI6, see
if we can get

590
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,160
Micro Forensics
to hurry this up.

591
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,560
We need the whole team
here in two hours

592
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,760
or it's not worth it.

593
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm very sorry.

594
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,720
T'CHALLA: In my culture...

595
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,920
death is not the end.

596
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,720
It's more of
a stepping-off point.

597
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,320
You reach out
with both hands...

598
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,640
and Bast and Sekhmet,

599
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,360
they lead you
into the green veldt...

600
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,080
where you can run forever.

601
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,080
That sounds very peaceful.

602
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,720
My father thought so.

603
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,400
I am not my father.

604
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,080
T'Challa...

605
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,040
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

606
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,400
Don't bother, Ms. Romanoff.

607
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
I'll kill him myself.

608
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Yeah?

609
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,720
You all right?

610
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,720
Uh, yeah, thanks.
I got lucky.

611
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,120
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

612
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,320
Stay home.
You'll only make this worse.

613
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,840
For all of us.

614
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,000
Please.

615
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,160
Are you saying
you'll arrest me?

616
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,800
No.

617
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Someone will.

618
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,440
If you interfere.
That's how it works now.

619
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,040
If he's this far gone, Nat,

620
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,640
I should be the one
to bring him in.

621
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,800
Why?

622
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,680
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

623
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,520
Shit.

624
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,840
She tell you
to stay out of it?

625
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Might have a point.

626
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,960
He'd do it for me.

627
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,600
1945, maybe.

628
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

629
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,040
The people that shoot at you

630
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,840
usually wind up
shooting at me.

631
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,440
Tips have been pouring in

632
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,960
since that footage
went public.

633
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,000
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier
goes to their gym.

634
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,960
Most of it's noise.

635
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,480
Except for this.

636
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,720
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

637
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,000
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

638
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,160
Thank you.

639
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,000
SHARON: You're
gonna have to hurry.

640
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,680
We have orders
to shoot on sight.

641
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,480
Homecoming

642
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,240
One

643
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,760
One

644
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,960
Freight car

645
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,120
I have your breakfast.

646
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,960
I could smell it before I opened the door.

647
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Side of bacon and black coffee.

648
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,280
Again.

649
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,240
I can make you something different, if you like.

650
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,480
This is wonderful...

651
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
I will just put this on your...

652
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,560
It's okay, I can manage!

653
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,200
Heads up, Cap.

654
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,680
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.

655
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,680
Understood.

656
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Do you know me?

657
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,040
You're Steve.

658
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,240
I read about you in a museum.

659
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,480
SAM: They've set
the perimeter.

660
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,040
I know you're nervous,

661
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,800
and you have
plenty of reason to be.

662
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,240
But you're lying.

663
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

664
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,640
They're entering
the building.

665
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,240
Well, the people
who think you did
are coming here now.

666
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,160
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

667
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,840
That's smart.

668
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,160
Good strategy.

669
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,200
They're on the roof.
I'm compromised.

670
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,160
This doesn't have to
end in a fight, Buck.

671
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
It always ends
in a fight.
Five seconds.

672
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,840
You pulled me
from the river.

673
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
Why?

674
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know.
Three seconds.

675
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,880
Yes, you do.

676
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,280
Breach! Breach! Breach!

677
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,800
Buck, stop!

678
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,640
You're gonna kill someone.

679
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

680
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,120
Suspect has broken containment!

681
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
...he's headed down the east stairwell!

682
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,040
Come on, man.

683
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
Ahhh!

684
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
Sam, southwest rooftop.

685
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,880
SAM: Who the hell's
the other guy?

686
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
About to find out.

687
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,680
Sam.
Got him.

688
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Stand down!

689
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,480
Stand down!

690
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,920
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

691
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,360
Right behind you.

692
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,560
Stand down, now.

693
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,280
Congratulations, Cap.

694
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,040
You're a criminal.

695
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,240
Your Highness.

696
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
"A pinch of paprika."

697
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,760
A pinch.

698
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,480
Is that paprikash?

699
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,920
I thought it might
lift your spirits.

700
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Spirits lifted.

701
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,640
In my defense,

702
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,680
I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so...

703
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,040
May I?

704
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Please.

705
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,560
Wanda?
Hmm.

706
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,640
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

707
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,040
Thanks.

708
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,160
Oh, you're welcome.

709
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,640
No, it's a involuntary
response in their amygdala.

710
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,800
They can't help
but be afraid of you.

711
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
Are you?

712
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,040
My amygdala
is synthetic, so...

713
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,120
I used to think
of myself one way.

714
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,320
But after this...

715
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,880
I am something else.

716
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,840
I'm still me,
I think, but...

717
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,480
that's not what
everyone else sees.

718
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,240
Do you know,
I don't know what this is?

719
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,840
Not really.

720
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,920
I know it's not
of this world...

721
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440
that it powered Loki's staff,

722
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,760
gave you your abilities,
but...

723
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,520
its true nature is a mystery.

724
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,760
And yet, it is part of me.

725
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,040
Are you afraid of it?

726
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,080
I wish to understand it.

727
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,400
The more I do,
the less it controls me.

728
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,520
One day... who knows?

729
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,120
I may even control it.

730
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,680
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

731
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,560
I'm gonna go
to the store.

732
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,200
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

733
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,120
Alternatively,
we could order a pizza?

734
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,560
Vision, are you not
letting me leave?

735
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,960
It is a question of safety.

736
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,080
I can protect myself.

737
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,880
Not yours.

738
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,160
Mr. Stark would like to
avoid the possibility

739
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,040
of another public incident.

740
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,640
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

741
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,160
And what do you want?

742
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,720
For people to see you...

743
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,120
as I do.

744
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
So, you like cats?

745
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,120
Sam.
SAM: What?

746
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,400
Dude shows up
dressed like a cat,

747
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,760
you don't wanna know more?

748
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,800
Your suit...
it's vibranium?

749
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,520
The Black Panther
has been the protector

750
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,600
of Wakanda for generations.

751
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,800
A mantle, passed from
warrior to warrior.

752
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,360
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

753
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,840
I also wear
the mantle of king.

754
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,000
So, I ask you...

755
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,120
as both warrior and king...

756
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,040
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

757
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,160
What's gonna
happen to him?

758
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,520
Same thing that ought
to happen to you.

759
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,840
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

760
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,840
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

761
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,560
What about a lawyer?

762
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,400
Lawyer. That's funny.

763
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,520
See their weapons
are placed in lockup.

764
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,560
We'll write you a receipt.

765
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,280
I better not
look out the window

766
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,400
and see anybody
flying around in that.

767
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,680
EVERETT: You'll be
provided with an office

768
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,160
instead of a cell.

769
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,360
Now, do me a favor,
stay in it?

770
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,040
I don't intend
on going anywhere.

771
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,040
For the record,
this is what

772
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,040
making things worse
looks like.

773
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,360
He's alive.

774
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,040
TONY: No.

775
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Romania was not
Accords-sanctioned.

776
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,200
Colonel Rhodes is
supervising cleanup.

777
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,320
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

778
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,880
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.

779
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,640
Obviously you can
quote me on that,

780
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,280
because I just said it.
Anything else?

781
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,520
Thank you, sir.

782
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,000
"Consequences"?

783
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,400
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

784
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,760
Had to give him something.

785
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,400
I'm not getting
that shield back, am I?

786
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,120
Technically, it's the
government's property.

787
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,440
Wings, too.

788
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,760
That's cold.

789
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,240
Warmer than jail.

790
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,040
TONY: Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

791
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,960
I pulled something
from Dad's archives.

792
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,800
Felt timely.

793
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,640
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

794
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,000
Provided support
to the Allies when
they needed it most.

795
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,320
Some would say it
brought our country
closer to war.

796
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,400
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

797
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,600
I'm trying to...
What do you call it?

798
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,680
That's an olive branch.

799
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,000
Is that what you call it?

800
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,920
Is Pepper here?
I didn't see her.

801
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,480
We're kinda...

802
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,800
Well, not kinda...
Pregnant?

803
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,640
No. Definitely not.

804
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,640
We're taking a break.

805
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,200
It's nobody's fault.

806
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,280
I'm so sorry, Tony.
I didn't know.

807
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,440
A few years ago,
I almost lost her,

808
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,000
so I trashed all my suits.

809
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,800
Then, we had to mop up
HYDRA...

810
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,320
and then Ultron. My fault.

811
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,640
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

812
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,320
Because the truth is
I don't wanna stop.

813
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,680
I don't wanna lose her.

814
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,640
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

815
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,200
In her defense,
I'm a handful.

816
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,880
Yet, Dad was
a pain in the ass,

817
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,800
but he and Mom
always made it work.

818
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,400
STEVE: I'm glad
Howard got married.

819
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,040
I only knew him
when he was young
and single.

820
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,160
Oh, really?
You two knew each other?

821
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,640
He never mentioned that.

822
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,400
Maybe only a
thousand times.

823
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,560
God, I hated you.

824
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,040
I don't mean to
make things difficult.

825
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,520
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

826
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,400
If I see a situation
pointed south...

827
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,840
I can't ignore it.

828
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,360
Sometimes I wish I could.

829
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,600
No, you don't.

830
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,040
No, I don't.

831
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Sometimes...

832
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,000
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your
perfect teeth.

833
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,160
But I don't wanna
see you gone.

834
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,560
We need you, Cap.

835
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,040
So far, nothing's happened

836
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,040
that can't be undone,
if you sign.

837
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,720
We can make
the last 24 hours legit.

838
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,200
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-center...

839
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,240
instead of a Wakandan prison.

840
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,600
I'm not saying
it's impossible...

841
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,720
but there would
have to be safeguards.

842
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,920
Sure.

843
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,720
Once we put out the PR fire,

844
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
those documents
can be amended.

845
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,880
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

846
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,880
Wanda? What about Wanda?

847
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,600
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

848
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,920
Vision's keeping her company.

849
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,280
Oh, God, Tony.

850
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,600
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

851
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,800
It's 100 acres
with a lap pool.

852
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
It's got a screening room.

853
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,120
There's worse ways
to protect people.

854
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Protection?

855
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,080
Is that how
you see this?

856
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,240
This is protection?
It's internment, Tony.

857
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,680
She's not a US citizen.
Oh, come on, Tony.

858
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,320
And they don't grant
visas to weapons of
mass destruction.

859
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,360
She's a kid!

860
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,000
Give me a break!

861
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,120
I'm doing what
has to be done.

862
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,080
To stave off
something worse.

863
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,120
You keep
telling yourself that.

864
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,600
Hate to break up the set.

865
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,800
HELMUT ZEMO:
Hello, Mr. Barnes.

866
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,840
I've been sent by
the United Nations
to evaluate you.

867
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,320
Do you mind if I sit?

868
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,840
Your first name is James?

869
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,280
The receipt
for your gear.

870
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,800
"Bird costume"?
Come on.

871
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,640
I didn't write it.

872
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,320
HELMUT ZEMO:
I'm not here to judge you.

873
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,200
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

874
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,200
Do you know
where you are, James?

875
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,160
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.

876
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,680
My name is Bucky.

877
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,160
Hello?

878
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,320
Hey!

879
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,880
Why would the Task Force

880
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,520
release this photo
to begin with?

881
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,200
Get the word out, involve
as many eyes as we can?

882
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,240
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

883
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,400
Set off a bomb,
get your picture taken.

884
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,600
Get seven billion people
looking

885
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,680
for the Winter Soldier.

886
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,600
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

887
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,760
Steve, we looked
for the guy for two years

888
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,880
and found nothing.

889
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,040
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

890
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,440
SHARON: Yeah,
but that doesn't guarantee

891
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,680
that whoever
framed him would get him.

892
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,600
It guarantees that we would.

893
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Yeah.

894
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,960
HELMUT ZEMO:
Tell me, Bucky.

895
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,600
You've seen a great deal,
haven't you?

896
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,040
I don't wanna talk about it.

897
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,360
You fear that if you
open your mouth,

898
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,240
the horrors
might never stop.

899
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,960
Don't worry.

900
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,440
We only have
to talk about one.

901
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,640
Come on, guys,
get me eyes on Barnes.

902
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,000
Friday,
get me a source
on that outage.

903
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,440
Sub-level five,
East Wing.

904
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,320
What the hell is this?

905
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,160
Why don't we
discuss your home?

906
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,320
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

907
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,880
I mean your real home.

908
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,400
Longing

909
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,000
No.

910
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Rusted

911
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Stop.

912
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,640
Seventeen

913
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,280
Stop.

914
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,320
Daybreak

915
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,600
Furnace

916
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Nine

917
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,400
Benign

918
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,440
Homecoming

919
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
One

920
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
Freight car

921
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,320
Soldier?

922
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,560
Ready to comply.

923
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:37,120
Mission report.
December 16, 1991.

924
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,120
HELMUT ZEMO: Help me.

925
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,720
Help.

926
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Get up.

927
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,080
Who are you?
What do you want?

928
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,560
To see an empire fall.

929
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,560
Hey.

930
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,680
EVERETT: Evac all civilians.

931
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,920
Get me a perimeter
around the building,

932
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,120
and gunships in the air.

933
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,800
Please tell me
you brought a suit.

934
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,000
Sure did.
It's a lovely Tom Ford,

935
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,440
three-piece,
two-button.

936
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,120
I'm an active-duty
non-combatant.

937
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,120
Follow me.

938
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
We're in position.

939
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
You could at least
recognize me.

940
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,760
Damn it.

941
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,200
WOMAN: He asked me again
if you were going to be there.

942
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,280
I said I wasn't sure.

943
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,200
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?

944
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,560
I'm going to bed.

945
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,160
I love you.

946
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,720
James Barnes the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing...

947
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,320
...escaped custody today.

948
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,520
...also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

949
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,640
and Sam Wilson.

950
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,040
SAM: Hey, Cap!

951
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,920
Steve.

952
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,160
Which Bucky am I
talking to?

953
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,840
Your mom's name was Sarah.

954
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,200
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

955
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,840
Can't read that
in a museum.

956
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,720
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

957
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,400
What did I do?

958
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
Enough.

959
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,360
Oh, God,
I knew this would happen.

960
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,800
Everything HYDRA
put inside me
is still there.

961
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,920
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

962
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,720
Who was he?
I don't know.

963
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,960
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

964
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,400
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

965
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,360
I need you to
do better than
"I don't know."

966
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,760
He wanted to know
about Siberia.

967
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,120
Where I was kept.

968
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,680
He wanted to know
exactly where.

969
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,160
Why would he need
to know that?

970
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,560
Because I'm not
the only Winter Soldier.

971
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,880
It hurts!

972
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,680
Good work.

973
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,440
Get me out of here.

974
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,360
Who were they?

975
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,120
BUCKY: Their most
elite death squad.

976
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,400
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

977
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,840
And that was
before the serum.

978
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,120
They all turn out
like you?

979
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,440
Worse.

980
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,840
The doctor,
could he control them?

981
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,200
Enough.

982
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,200
Said he wanted
to see an empire fall.

983
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,040
BUCKY: With these guys,
he could do it.

984
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,600
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

985
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,000
infiltrate, assassinate,
destabilize.

986
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,600
They can take
a whole country down

987
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,160
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

988
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,920
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

989
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,640
If we call Tony...
No, he won't believe us.

990
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,720
Even if he did...

991
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,600
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

992
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,040
We're on our own.

993
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,480
Maybe not.

994
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,960
I know a guy.

995
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,840
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

996
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
TONY: We will.

997
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,680
GSG 9's got
the borders covered.

998
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,560
Recon's flying 24/7.

999
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,160
They'll get a hit.
We'll handle it.

1000
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,080
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

1001
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,640
It's clear
you can't be objective.

1002
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,320
I'm putting
Special Ops on this.

1003
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,640
What happens when
the shooting starts?

1004
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,040
What, do you kill
Steve Rogers?

1005
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,440
SECRETARY ROSS:
If we're provoked.

1006
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,240
Barnes would've been
eliminated

1007
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,920
in Romania
if it wasn't for Rogers.

1008
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,880
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

1009
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,760
Feel free to check my math.

1010
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,320
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

1011
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,680
with boys and bullets, Ross.

1012
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,960
You gotta let us
bring them in.

1013
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,040
How would that end any
differently than last time?

1014
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,240
Because this time,

1015
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,080
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

1016
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,160
72 hours, guaranteed.

1017
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,160
36 hours.

1018
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,000
Barnes.

1019
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,840
Rogers.

1020
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Wilson.

1021
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,840
Thank you, sir.

1022
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,040
My left arm is numb.
Is that normal?

1023
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,520
You all right?

1024
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,760
Always.

1025
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,120
36 hours. Jeez.

1026
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,320
We're seriously understaffed.

1027
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,680
Oh, yeah.

1028
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,880
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now.
Any shot?

1029
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,360
You really think
he'd be on our side?

1030
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,600
No.

1031
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,960
I have an idea.

1032
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,560
Me, too. Where's yours?

1033
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,520
Downstairs.

1034
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,840
Where's yours?

1035
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,520
MAY: Mmm. Hey.

1036
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,400
How was school today?

1037
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,840
PETER: It was okay.

1038
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,280
This crazy car
parked outside.

1039
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,520
Oh, Mr. Parker.
Um...

1040
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,800
What are you doing...

1041
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,760
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

1042
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,200
Tony.

1043
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,240
What are you doing here?

1044
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,680
It's about time we met.

1045
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,480
You've been getting
my emails, right?

1046
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,280
Yeah. Yeah.
Right?

1047
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,480
Regarding the...

1048
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
You didn't even tell me
about the grant.

1049
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,200
About the grant.
The September Foundation.

1050
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,360
Right.
Yeah.

1051
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,440
Remember when
you applied?

1052
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,560
Yeah.

1053
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,200
I approved,
so now we're
in business.

1054
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,880
But you didn't
tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1055
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,120
You keeping secrets
from me now?

1056
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,160
I just know how much
you love surprises

1057
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,080
so I thought I would
let you know...

1058
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,240
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1059
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
That's what I'm here
to hash out.

1060
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,880
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1061
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,680
It's so hard for me
to believe that she's
someone's aunt.

1062
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,160
Yeah, well,
we come in all shapes
and sizes, you know?

1063
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,720
This walnut date loaf
is exceptional.

1064
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,280
Let me just stop you there.
Yeah.

1065
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,240
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1066
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,640
TONY: Yeah,
it's pretty well funded.

1067
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,880
Yeah? Wow.

1068
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,600
Look who you're
talking to.

1069
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Can I have five minutes
with him?

1070
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,880
Sure.

1071
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,040
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1072
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,120
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1073
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,000
Thrift store?
Salvation Army?

1074
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,080
Uh, the garbage, actually.
You're a dumpster diver?

1075
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,360
Yeah, I was...

1076
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,000
Anyway, look, um,

1077
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,640
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1078
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,440
Ah-ah! Me first.
Okay.

1079
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,000
Quick question of
the rhetorical variety.

1080
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,320
That's you, right?

1081
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,680
Um, no.

1082
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,400
What do you mean?
Yeah.

1083
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,920
Look at you go.

1084
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,240
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds,
40 miles an hour.

1085
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,160
That's not easy.
You got mad skills.

1086
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,240
That's all on YouTube,
though, right?

1087
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,840
That's where you found that?

1088
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,040
Because you know
that's all fake.

1089
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,160
It's all done
on the computer.

1090
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,400
Mmm-hmm.

1091
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,560
It's like that video.
What is it?

1092
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,520
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1093
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,840
Exactly.

1094
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,240
Oh, what have we here?

1095
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,400
Uh...

1096
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,280
You're the Spider-ling.

1097
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,360
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1098
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,760
Spider-Man.

1099
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,960
Not in that onesie,
you're not.

1100
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,440
It's not a onesie.

1101
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,160
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1102
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,040
a really good day today,
Mr. Stark.

1103
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,560
Didn't miss my train,
this perfectly good

1104
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,360
DVD player
was just sitting there...

1105
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,600
and Algebra test,
nailed it.

1106
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,960
Who else knows? Anybody?

1107
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,560
Nobody.

1108
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,960
Not even your unusually
attractive aunt?

1109
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,400
No. No.

1110
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,160
No! If she knew,
she would freak out.

1111
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,040
And when she freaks out,
I freak out.

1112
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,320
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1113
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,000
That tensile strength
is off the charts.

1114
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,480
Who manufactured that?

1115
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,960
I did.

1116
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,640
Climbing walls,
how you doing that?

1117
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,040
Adhesive gloves?

1118
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,520
It's a long story. I was...

1119
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,360
Lordy! Can you even
see in these?

1120
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,520
Yes, I can.

1121
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,840
I'm blind!

1122
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,400
I can see in those.

1123
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,480
Okay?

1124
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,920
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1125
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,280
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1126
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,040
There's way too much input,

1127
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,120
so they just kinda
help me focus.

1128
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,640
You're in dire need
of an upgrade.

1129
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,200
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1130
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,280
That's why I'm here.

1131
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,400
Why you doing this?

1132
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,000
I gotta know,
what's your MO?

1133
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,440
What gets you
outta that twin bed
in the morning?

1134
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,840
Because...

1135
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,840
Because I've been me
my whole life,

1136
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,600
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1137
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,240
Mmm-hmm.

1138
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,680
I read books,
I build computers.

1139
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,560
Yeah, I would love
to play football,

1140
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,200
but I couldn't then,
so I shouldn't now.

1141
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,960
Sure,
because you're different.

1142
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,560
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1143
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,040
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1144
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,360
and then the bad things
happen...

1145
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,000
they happen because of you.

1146
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,920
So you wanna look out
for the little guy,

1147
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,200
you wanna do your part?

1148
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,600
Make the world
a better place,
all that, right?

1149
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,320
Yeah, just looking out
for the little guy.

1150
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,960
That's what it is.

1151
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,400
I'm gonna sit here,
so you move the leg.

1152
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,560
You got a passport?

1153
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,000
No, I don't even have
a driver's license.

1154
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,560
You ever been to Germany?
No.

1155
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,760
Oh, you'll love it.

1156
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,840
I can't go to Germany.
Why?

1157
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,560
I got homework.

1158
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,080
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

1159
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,280
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop
out of school.

1160
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,520
Might be
a little dangerous.

1161
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,480
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm
taking you on a field trip.

1162
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,160
Don't tell Aunt May.

1163
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,120
All right,
Spider-Man.

1164
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,920
Get me out of this.

1165
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,200
Sorry. I'll get the...

1166
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,280
What is it?

1167
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Stay here, please.

1168
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,000
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1169
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,600
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

1170
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,320
Disappointing my kids.

1171
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,360
I'm supposed to go
waterskiing.

1172
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,640
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1173
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Clint!

1174
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,240
You should not be here.

1175
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,840
Really?

1176
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,080
I retire for, what,
like five minutes,

1177
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,200
and it all
goes to shit.

1178
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,760
Please consider
the consequences
of your actions.

1179
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,960
Okay, they're considered.

1180
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,800
Okay, we gotta go.

1181
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,560
It's this way.

1182
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,920
I've caused
enough problems.

1183
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,960
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1184
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,840
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1185
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,160
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1186
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,240
Shit.

1187
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,400
I knew I should've stretched.

1188
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,520
VISION: Clint,
you can't overpower me.

1189
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,520
I know I can't.

1190
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,680
But she can.

1191
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,280
Vision, that's enough.
Let him go.

1192
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,160
I'm leaving.

1193
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,480
I can't let you.

1194
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,840
I'm sorry.

1195
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,200
If you do this...

1196
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,640
they will never stop
being afraid of you.

1197
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,520
I can't control their fear,
only my own.

1198
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,920
CLINT: Oh...

1199
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,200
Come on. We got
one more stop.

1200
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,760
ATTACHE: It's just
a matter of time.

1201
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,680
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1202
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,400
and behavioral pattern scans.

1203
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,120
Move or you will be moved.

1204
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,080
As entertaining
as that would be...

1205
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,400
You really think
you can find him?

1206
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,560
My resources are
considerable.

1207
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,120
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1208
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,720
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1209
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,600
You know where they are.

1210
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,840
I know someone who does.

1211
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,040
Not sure you
understand the concept
of a getaway car.

1212
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,240
It's low profile.

1213
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,600
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1214
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,920
Can you move
your seat up?

1215
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,160
No.

1216
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,560
I owe you again.

1217
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,720
Keeping a list.

1218
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,640
You know, he kinda
tried to kill me.

1219
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,240
Sorry. I'll put it
on the list, too.

1220
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,840
They're going to come
looking for you.

1221
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,040
I know.

1222
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,040
Thank you, Sharon.

1223
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
That was...

1224
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,760
Late.

1225
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,920
Damn right.

1226
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,280
I should go.

1227
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,440
Okay.

1228
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,160
Cap.

1229
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,400
You know I wouldn't
have called

1230
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,560
if I had any other choice.

1231
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,000
Hey, man,
you're doing me a favor.

1232
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,520
Besides, I owe a debt.

1233
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,240
Thanks for having
my back.

1234
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,920
It was time to
get off my ass.

1235
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,120
How about our
other recruit?

1236
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,840
He's rarin' to go.

1237
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,840
Had to put a little
coffee in him...

1238
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,360
but he should be good.

1239
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,200
What time zone is this?

1240
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,200
Come on. Come on.

1241
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,240
Captain America!
Mr. Lang.

1242
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,400
It's an honor.

1243
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,600
I'm shaking
your hand too long.

1244
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,000
Wow! This is awesome!

1245
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,800
Captain America.
I know you, too.
You're great!

1246
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,560
Jeez.

1247
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,520
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1248
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,680
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1249
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,480
thinks for thanking of me.

1250
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,520
Hey, man!
What's up, Tic Tac?

1251
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,680
Uh, good to see you.

1252
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,200
Look, what happened
last time when I...

1253
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,600
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1254
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,040
They tell you what
we're up against?

1255
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,400
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1256
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
We're outside the law
on this one.

1257
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,840
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1258
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,800
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1259
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,000
We should get moving.

1260
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,880
We got a chopper lined up.

1261
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,200
They're evacuating
the airport.

1262
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,480
Stark.

1263
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,640
Stark?

1264
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,600
Suit up.

1265
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,240
IRON MAN: Wow, it's so weird

1266
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,320
how you run
into people at the airport.

1267
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,040
Don't you think that's weird?
Definitely weird.

1268
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,400
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Hear me out, Tony.

1269
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,440
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1270
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,000
Captain.

1271
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,200
Your Highness.

1272
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:59,680
IRON MAN: Anyway...

1273
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,120
Ross gave me 36 hours
to bring you in.

1274
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,200
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1275
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,720
You're after
the wrong guy.

1276
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,960
Your judgment is askew.

1277
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,520
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1278
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,520
And there are five
more super soldiers
just like him.

1279
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,160
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony.
I can't.

1280
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,400
BLACK WIDOW: Steve...

1281
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,480
you know what's
about to happen.

1282
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,000
Do you really wanna punch
your way out of this one?

1283
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
All right, I've run out
of patience.

1284
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,160
Underoos!

1285
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,840
Nice job, kid.
Thanks.

1286
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,840
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1287
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,840
New suit.
It's nothing, Mr. Stark.

1288
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,160
It's perfect. Thank you.

1289
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,000
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1290
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,200
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1291
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,720
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1292
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,000
Yeah, we'll talk
about it later.

1293
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,760
Hey, everyone.
Good job.

1294
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,240
You've been busy.

1295
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,440
And you've been
a complete idiot.

1296
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,560
Dragging in Clint...

1297
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,120
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

1298
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,360
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1299
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,720
I'm trying to keep...

1300
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,120
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1301
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,880
You did that
when you signed.

1302
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,040
All right, we're done.

1303
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,200
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

1304
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,560
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

1305
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,360
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1306
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,200
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1307
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,400
Come on.

1308
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,080
FALCON: We found it.

1309
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,560
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

1310
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,720
All right, Lang.

1311
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,320
Hey, guys, something...

1312
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,200
What the hell was that?

1313
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,400
I believe this is yours,
Captain America.

1314
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,560
Oh, great.

1315
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,960
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1316
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,400
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1317
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,960
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?

1318
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,160
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.

1319
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,320
Barnes is mine.

1320
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,120
Hey, Mr. Stark,
what should I do?

1321
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,200
What we discussed.

1322
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,280
Keep your distance,
web them up.

1323
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,600
Okay, copy that.

1324
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,960
Move, Captain.

1325
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,920
I won't ask a second time.

1326
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,680
Look, I really don't
want to hurt you.

1327
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,680
I wouldn't stress about it.

1328
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,280
What the hell
is that?

1329
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,480
Everyone's got
a gimmick now.

1330
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,440
You have a metal arm?

1331
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,120
That is awesome, dude.

1332
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,280
You have the right
to remain silent!

1333
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,320
Sorry, Cap,
this won't kill you...

1334
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,720
but it ain't gonna
tickle either.

1335
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,040
Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.

1336
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,560
You locked me
in my room.

1337
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,160
Okay, first,
that's an exaggeration.

1338
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,640
Second, I did it
to protect you.

1339
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,160
Hey, Clint.
Hey, man.

1340
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,040
Clearly,
retirement doesn't suit you.

1341
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,680
You got tired of
shooting golf?

1342
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,200
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1343
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,320
Just can't seem to miss.

1344
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,240
First time for everything.

1345
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,520
Made you look.

1346
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,680
FRIDAY: Multiple
contusions detected.

1347
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,520
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1348
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,400
Oh, God!

1349
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,360
Hey, buddy,
I think you lost this!

1350
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,040
Ahh!

1351
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,720
Those wings carbon fiber?

1352
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,200
Is this stuff
coming out of you?

1353
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,960
That would explain the
rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1354
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,480
which, gotta say,
that's awesome, man.

1355
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,200
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1356
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,880
but there's usually
not this much talking.

1357
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,040
All right, sorry.
My bad.

1358
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,880
Guys, look,
I'd love to
keep this up,

1359
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,600
but I've only got
one job here today...

1360
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,720
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1361
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,400
You couldn't have
done that earlier?

1362
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,160
I hate you.

1363
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,640
Great.

1364
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,400
Hey, Cap, heads-up!

1365
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,320
Throw it at this.

1366
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,960
Now!

1367
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,760
Oh, come on!

1368
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,520
Oh, man,
I thought it was
a water truck.

1369
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,600
Uh, sorry.

1370
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,000
All right,
now I'm pissed.

1371
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,200
Is this part
of the plan?

1372
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,880
Well, my plan was
go easy on them.

1373
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,200
You wanna switch it up?

1374
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,760
There's our ride.

1375
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Come on!

1376
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,120
Captain Rogers...

1377
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,120
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1378
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,720
But for the collective good...

1379
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,200
you must surrender now.

1380
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,000
FALCON: What do we do, Cap?

1381
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,200
We fight.

1382
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,640
This is gonna end well.

1383
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,720
They're not stopping.

1384
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,920
Neither are we.

1385
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,080
We're still friends, right?

1386
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,760
Depends on how hard
you hit me.

1387
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,560
You were pulling
your punches.

1388
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,200
I didn't kill
your father.

1389
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,680
Then why did you run?

1390
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,280
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1391
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,360
Look, kid, there's
a lot going on here

1392
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,440
that you don't understand.

1393
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,240
Mr. Stark said
you'd say that. Wow.

1394
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,640
He also said to go
for your legs.

1395
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,080
Ahhh!

1396
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,760
Clint, can you get him off me?

1397
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,080
Buckled in?

1398
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,640
ANT-MAN: Yeah.
No, I'm good.

1399
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,840
I'm good, Arrow Guy.
Let's go!

1400
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,960
Stark tell you
anything else?

1401
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,800
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1402
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,880
That makes you dangerous.

1403
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,360
Guess he had a point.

1404
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,480
You got heart, kid.
Where you from?

1405
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,520
Queens.

1406
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Brooklyn.

1407
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,960
Friday?

1408
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,240
FRIDAY: We have some
weapon systems offline.

1409
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,320
What?

1410
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,040
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.

1411
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,520
Who's speaking?

1412
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:57,400
It's your conscience. We don't
talk a lot these days.

1413
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,640
Friday?

1414
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,000
FRIDAY: Deploying fire
suppression system.

1415
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,160
Uh-oh.

1416
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,160
Oh, boy!

1417
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,840
Whoa!

1418
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,560
We gotta go.
That guy's probably
in Siberia by now.

1419
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,120
We gotta draw out the flyers.

1420
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,040
I'll take Vision,
you get to the jet.

1421
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,840
No, you get to the jet!

1422
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,200
Both of you!

1423
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,680
The rest of us
aren't getting out of here.

1424
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,040
As much as I hate
to admit it...

1425
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,600
if we're gonna win this one,

1426
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,280
some of us
might have to lose it.

1427
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,520
FALCON: This isn't
the real fight, Steve.

1428
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,200
All right, Sam.
What's the play?

1429
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,600
We need a diversion.
Something big.

1430
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,880
ANT-MAN:
I got something kinda big.

1431
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,400
But I can't hold it very long.

1432
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,760
On my signal,
run like hell.

1433
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,240
And if I tear myself
in half...

1434
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,560
don't come back for me.

1435
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,680
He's gonna tear
himself in half?

1436
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,240
You sure about this, Scott?

1437
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,760
ANT-MAN: I do it all the time.

1438
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,760
I mean, once. In a lab.

1439
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,560
Then I passed out.

1440
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,640
I'm the boss, I'm the boss,
I'm the boss.

1441
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,280
Holy shit!

1442
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,440
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1443
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,600
I guess that's the signal.

1444
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,240
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1445
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,600
Give me back my Rhodey.

1446
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,440
I got him.

1447
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,640
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1448
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,440
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

1449
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,720
I'm open to suggestions.

1450
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,480
ANT-MAN:
You wanna get to them...

1451
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,400
you gotta go through me.

1452
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,840
Uh-huh.

1453
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,240
We haven't met yet.

1454
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,560
I'm Clint.
I don't care.

1455
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,720
Whoa!

1456
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,760
Ahhh!

1457
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,360
Get off!

1458
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,040
Something just flew in me!

1459
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,320
You're not gonna stop.

1460
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
You know I can't.

1461
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,960
I'm gonna regret this.

1462
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Go.

1463
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,640
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1464
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,760
Empire Strikes Back?

1465
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,280
WAR MACHINE: Jesus, Tony,
how old is this guy?

1466
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,480
I don't know,
I didn't carbon-date him.

1467
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,680
He's on the young side.

1468
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,760
You know that part where
they're on the snow planet...

1469
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,520
with the walking thingies?

1470
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,960
Maybe the kid's
onto something.

1471
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,120
High now, Tony. Go high.

1472
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,600
SPIDER-MAN: Yes!

1473
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,800
That was awesome!

1474
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,520
Does anyone have
any orange slices?

1475
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,000
Kid, you all right?

1476
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,240
Whoa!

1477
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,240
Same side. Guess who.
Hi. It's me.

1478
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,480
Hey, man.
Yeah.

1479
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:15,840
That was scary.
Yeah.

1480
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,640
You're done, all right?

1481
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,800
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

1482
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,920
You did a good job.
Stay down.

1483
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,160
No, it's good.
I gotta get him back.

1484
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,320
You're going home
or I'll call Aunt May!

1485
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,680
Dude.
You're done!

1486
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:24,880
Wait.

1487
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,040
I'm not done. I'm not...

1488
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,520
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1489
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,880
BLACK WIDOW: I said I'd help
you find him, not catch him.

1490
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,040
There's a difference.

1491
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,720
I'm sorry.

1492
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,520
Me, too.

1493
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,440
It's as I said.

1494
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,640
Catastrophe.

1495
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,400
Vision, I got a bandit
on my six.

1496
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,120
Vision! You copy?

1497
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,320
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.

1498
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,600
Rhodey!

1499
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,200
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1500
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,400
Rhodes!

1501
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,600
Read vitals.

1502
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,000
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected.

1503
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,200
Emergency medical
is on its way.

1504
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,360
I'm sorry.

1505
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,600
- this is room 201...

1506
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,600
Bacon and black coffee again today?

1507
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,480
You know me so well...

1508
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,840
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1509
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,960
May I let myself in?

1510
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,000
What's gonna happen
to your friends?

1511
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,960
Whatever it is...

1512
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,440
I'll deal with it.

1513
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,360
I don't know if
I'm worth all this, Steve.

1514
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,480
What you did
all those years...

1515
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,960
It wasn't you.

1516
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,520
You didn't have a choice.

1517
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,360
I know.

1518
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,280
But I did it.

1519
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,520
How did this happen?

1520
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,720
I became distracted.

1521
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,160
I didn't think
that was possible.

1522
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:29,240
Neither did I.

1523
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,760
TONY: The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1524
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,720
Extreme laceration
to the spinal cord.

1525
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,520
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1526
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,400
NATASHA:
Steve's not gonna stop.

1527
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,200
If you don't either,

1528
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,480
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1529
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,920
You let them go, Nat.

1530
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,120
We played this wrong.

1531
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,520
"We"?

1532
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,040
Boy, it must be hard to

1533
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,200
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

1534
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,400
It sticks
in the DNA.

1535
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,520
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1536
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,760
for one goddamn second?

1537
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,200
T'Challa told Ross
what you did, so...

1538
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,120
they're coming for you.

1539
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,600
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1540
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,880
What am I looking at, Friday?

1541
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,440
FRIDAY: Priority upload
from Berlin police.

1542
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,840
Fire up the chopper.

1543
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,760
FRIDAY: The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist

1544
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,560
as soon as Barnes
was captured.

1545
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,000
The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard

1546
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,520
from Geneva within the hour.

1547
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,320
He was met by this man.

1548
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,480
TONY: Did you run
facial recognition yet?

1549
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,680
FRIDAY: What do I look like?

1550
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,840
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing
a redhead.

1551
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,600
You must be thinking
of someone else.

1552
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:10,760
Must be.

1553
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,680
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.

1554
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,000
Sokovian Intelligence.

1555
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,000
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...

1556
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,680
a Sokovian covert kill squad.

1557
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,320
What happened to
the real Broussard?

1558
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,360
He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.

1559
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:31,200
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...

1560
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,440
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.

1561
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,280
Son of a bitch.

1562
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,200
Get this to Ross.
Yes, boss.

1563
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,760
This is Raft Prison Control.

1564
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,360
You're cleared
for landing, Mr. Stark.

1565
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,840
So? You got the files?

1566
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,160
Let's reroute the satellites,

1567
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,240
start facial scanning
for this Zemo guy.

1568
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,520
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1569
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,760
after that fiasco
in Leipzig?

1570
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:05,360
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1571
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,680
CLINT: The Futurist,
gentlemen!

1572
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,280
The Futurist is here!

1573
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,800
He sees all!

1574
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,880
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1575
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,520
Give me a break, Barton.

1576
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,240
I had no idea they'd
put you here. Come on.

1577
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,480
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1578
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,800
Yeah, but not some super-max
floating ocean pokey.

1579
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,400
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1580
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,840
CLINT: Criminals?

1581
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,720
Criminals, Tony.

1582
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,560
Think that's the word
you're looking for.

1583
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,040
Right?

1584
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,320
That didn't used
to mean me.

1585
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,320
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1586
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,040
But here we are.

1587
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,880
Because you broke the law.
Yeah.

1588
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,080
I didn't make you.

1589
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,040
La, la, la, la, la...
You read it, you broke it.

1590
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,920
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1591
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,240
I don't understand,
why didn't you

1592
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,240
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

1593
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,280
You gotta watch your back
with this guy.

1594
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,720
There's a chance
he's gonna break it.

1595
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,440
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1596
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,680
Who are you?

1597
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,200
Come on, man.

1598
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,600
SAM: How's Rhodes?

1599
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,640
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1600
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,960
so fingers crossed.

1601
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,200
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

1602
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,800
You're the good cop, now?

1603
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,240
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1604
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,960
Well, you better go
get a bad cop...

1605
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,200
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1606
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,320
to get information
out of me.

1607
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,480
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1608
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,800
We got about
30 seconds before

1609
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,480
they realize
it's not their equipment.

1610
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,480
SECRETARY ROSS:
What'd you do?

1611
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,240
Get it back up!

1612
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,920
Just look.

1613
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,720
Because that...

1614
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,000
is the fellow
who was supposed to
interrogate Barnes.

1615
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:27,160
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1616
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,800
That's a first.

1617
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,560
Cap is definitely
off the reservation...

1618
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,160
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1619
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,760
We don't know
each other very well.

1620
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,920
You don't have to...

1621
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,400
Hey, it's all right.

1622
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,760
Look, I'll tell you...

1623
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:50,000
but you have to go alone
and as a friend.

1624
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,600
Easy.

1625
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,600
SECRETARY ROSS: Stark?

1626
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,840
Did he give you anything
on Rogers?

1627
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,040
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1628
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,040
I'm going back
to the compound instead,

1629
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,120
but you can call me anytime.

1630
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,880
I'll put you on hold. I like
to watch the line blink.

1631
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,920
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1632
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,360
from Rockaway Beach in the
back of that freezer truck?

1633
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,560
Was that the time
we used our train money

1634
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,760
to buy hot dogs?

1635
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,520
You blew three bucks
trying to win

1636
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,120
that stuffed bear
for a redhead.

1637
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:27,760
What was her name, again?

1638
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:29,760
Dolores.
You called her Dot.

1639
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,960
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1640
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:33,280
So are we, pal.

1641
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,120
STEVE: He can't have
been here more than
a few hours.

1642
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,280
BUCKY: Long enough
to wake them up.

1643
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:30,480
You ready?

1644
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,640
Yeah.

1645
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,280
You seem a little defensive.

1646
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,680
It's been a long day.

1647
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,360
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1648
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:53,760
Then why are you here?

1649
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,440
Could be your story's
not so crazy.

1650
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,520
Maybe.

1651
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:03,040
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1652
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,160
Otherwise, I gotta
arrest myself.

1653
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,040
Well, that sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

1654
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,040
It's good to see you, Tony.

1655
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:15,160
You too, Cap.

1656
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,640
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1657
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,720
There's a truce here.
You can drop...

1658
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,040
IRON MAN:
I got heat signatures.

1659
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,680
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
How many?

1660
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,600
Uh, one.

1661
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,440
If it's any comfort,

1662
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,120
they died in their sleep.

1663
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:19,240
Did you really think
I wanted more of you?

1664
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,120
What the hell?

1665
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,720
I'm grateful to them, though.

1666
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,280
They brought you here.

1667
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,760
Please, Captain.

1668
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,720
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand

1669
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:38,400
the launch blast of
UR-100 rockets.

1670
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,320
IRON MAN: I'm betting
I could beat that.

1671
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,280
HELMUT ZEMO: Oh, I'm sure
you could, Mr. Stark.

1672
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,280
Given time.

1673
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,400
But then you'd never know
why you came.

1674
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,120
You killed innocent
people in Vienna just
to bring us here?

1675
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,440
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1676
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,960
I studied you.

1677
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,840
I followed you.

1678
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,160
But now that
you're standing here...

1679
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,440
I just realized...

1680
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:13,080
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1681
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:17,960
How nice to find a flaw.

1682
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,080
You're Sokovian.

1683
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,800
Is that what
this is about?

1684
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,600
Sokovia was a failed state

1685
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,440
long before
you blew it to hell.

1686
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,520
No.

1687
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:32,040
I'm here because
I made a promise.

1688
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,360
You lost someone?

1689
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:42,320
I lost everyone.

1690
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,760
And so will you.

1691
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:55,680
An empire toppled by
its enemies can rise again.

1692
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,880
But one which crumbles
from within?

1693
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,000
That's dead.

1694
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:04,160
Forever.

1695
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,680
I know that road.

1696
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,080
What is this?

1697
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,880
Help my wife.

1698
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,280
Please. Help.

1699
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,040
Sergeant Barnes?

1700
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,080
MARIA: Howard!

1701
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,720
Howard!

1702
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:43,720
No, Tony.

1703
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,160
Did you know?

1704
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,840
I didn't know
it was him.

1705
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,520
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1706
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,360
Yes.

1707
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,760
Get out of here!

1708
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,040
It wasn't him, Tony.

1709
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:17,120
HYDRA had control of his mind!

1710
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:18,200
Move!

1711
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:19,280
It wasn't him!

1712
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,760
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing.

1713
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,600
Flight systems compromised.

1714
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:34,280
Ah, crap.

1715
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:49,840
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1716
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:13,840
Come on, come on.

1717
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,640
FRIDAY: Targeting system's
knackered, boss.

1718
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:16,800
I'm eyeballing it.

1719
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,000
Do you even remember them?

1720
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:38,920
I remember
all of them.

1721
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,680
This isn't gonna change
what happened.

1722
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,360
I don't care.

1723
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:07,400
He killed my mom.

1724
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,400
WOMAN: You should have
seen his little face.

1725
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,080
Just try, okay?

1726
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,120
I'm going to bed.

1727
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,920
I love you.

1728
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:26,480
T'CHALLA: I almost
killed the wrong man.

1729
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,480
Hardly an innocent one.

1730
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,280
T'CHALLA:
This is all you wanted?

1731
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,800
To see them
rip each other apart.

1732
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:41,400
My father lived
outside the city.

1733
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,680
I thought
we would be safe there.

1734
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,120
My son was excited.

1735
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:50,120
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1736
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,400
I told my wife,
"Don't worry.

1737
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:58,480
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1738
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,200
When the dust cleared...

1739
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,400
and the screaming stopped...

1740
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:11,080
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1741
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,000
My father...

1742
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,320
still holding my wife
and son in his arms.

1743
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,840
And the Avengers?

1744
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,600
They went home.

1745
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,720
I knew I couldn't
kill them.

1746
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,360
More powerful men
than me have tried.

1747
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:39,920
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...

1748
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:47,200
I'm sorry about
your father.

1749
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:49,440
He seemed a good man.

1750
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,840
With a dutiful son.

1751
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:59,360
Vengeance has consumed you.

1752
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,360
It's consuming them.

1753
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:10,440
I am done letting it
consume me.

1754
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,400
Justice will come
soon enough.

1755
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,600
Tell that to the dead.

1756
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,800
The living are
not done with you, yet.

1757
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:34,080
FRIDAY: You can't beat him
hand-to-hand.

1758
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,440
Analyze his fight pattern.

1759
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:37,920
Scanning.

1760
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,760
Countermeasures ready.

1761
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:46,800
Let's kick his ass.

1762
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,920
He's my friend.

1763
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:03,680
So was I.

1764
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,760
Stay down. Final warning.

1765
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,720
I could do this all day.

1766
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:38,000
That shield
doesn't belong to you.

1767
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,200
You don't deserve it.

1768
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,360
My father made that shield!

1769
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:20,880
Meals at 8 and 5.

1770
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:22,720
Toilet privileges
twice a day.

1771
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,240
Raise your voice, zap.

1772
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,080
Touch the glass, zap.

1773
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:32,280
You step out of line,
you deal with me.

1774
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:34,800
Please, step out of line, hmm?

1775
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:38,320
So how does it feel?

1776
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,640
To spend all that time,
all that effort...

1777
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:48,840
to see it fail
so spectacularly?

1778
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:53,960
Did it?

1779
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:20,480
TONY: It's just
the first pass.

1780
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:21,600
JAMES RHODES: Yeah.

1781
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:23,720
TONY: Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1782
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:26,560
Shock absorption,
lateral movement.

1783
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:28,160
Cup holder?

1784
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,040
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

1785
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:31,200
Ow.

1786
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:35,000
Let's go.
I'll give you a hand.

1787
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,840
No. Don't help me.

1788
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:41,040
Ah.

1789
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,320
138.

1790
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,680
138 combat missions.

1791
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,600
That's how many
I've flown, Tony.

1792
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:02,840
Every one of them
could've been my last,
but I flew them.

1793
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,400
Because the fight
needed to be fought.

1794
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:08,560
It's the same with
these Accords.

1795
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:12,600
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

1796
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,600
And yeah, this sucks.
This is, uh...

1797
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,680
This is a bad beat.

1798
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,440
But it hasn't
changed my mind.

1799
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,440
I don't think.

1800
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,280
You okay?
Oh, yeah.

1801
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:44,560
Are you Tony Stank?

1802
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:49,040
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1803
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,880
Thank you for that!

1804
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:52,920
Never dropping that,
by the way.

1805
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,080
"Table for one, Mr. Stank.

1806
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:56,400
"Please, by the bathroom."

1807
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:03,800
STEVE: Tony...

1808
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,960
I'm glad you're
back at the compound.

1809
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:08,120
I don't like the idea of you

1810
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:09,920
rattling around
a mansion by yourself.

1811
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:11,760
We all need family.

1812
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:17,080
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.

1813
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,240
I've been on my own
since I was 18.

1814
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:23,760
I never really
fit in anywhere,

1815
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,680
even in the Army.

1816
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,480
My faith's in people, I guess.

1817
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:31,840
Individuals.

1818
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:35,840
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...

1819
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,600
they haven't let me down.

1820
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:42,160
Which is why I can't
let them down either.

1821
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:49,440
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.

1822
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,480
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1823
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:55,400
I guess I thought
by not telling you

1824
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,680
about your parents...

1825
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:59,160
I was sparing you...

1826
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,960
but I can see now that I was
really sparing myself.

1827
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:04,440
And I'm sorry.

1828
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:06,240
Hopefully one day
you can understand.

1829
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,440
I wish we agreed
on the Accords.

1830
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:11,120
I really do.

1831
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,800
I know you're doing
what you believe in,

1832
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:14,440
and that's all
any of us can do.

1833
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:15,880
That's all any of us should.

1834
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,960
FRIDAY: Priority call from
Secretary Ross.

1835
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:19,880
There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.

1836
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,400
Yeah, put him through.

1837
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,880
SECRETARY ROSS:
Tony, we have a problem.

1838
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:28,080
Uh, please hold.
No, don't.

1839
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,320
STEVE: So no matter what...

1840
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:34,720
I promise you...

1841
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,640
if you need us...

1842
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:38,880
if you need me...

1843
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,000
I'll be there.

1844
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,320
You sure about this?

1845
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,200
I can't trust
my own mind.

1846
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:53,120
So, until they figure out

1847
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:54,720
how to get this stuff
out of my head...

1848
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:57,280
I think going back under
is the best thing.

1849
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,560
For everybody.

1850
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,000
Thank you for this.

1851
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:27,520
Your friend and my father...

1852
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,520
they were both victims.

1853
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,360
If I can help
one of them find peace...

1854
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,920
You know, if they
find out he's here...

1855
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:43,240
they'll come for him.

1856
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,680
Let them try.

1857
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:42,040
I'm hot like the prodigal son

1858
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,680
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe

1859
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:51,680
You're the chosen one

1860
02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:00,240
And your right's in a grip

1861
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:04,840
Watch his right hand slip

1862
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:24,160
Oh, my days, we're rolling

1863
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:34,400
gripped on his Colt
Single Action Army

1864
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:42,600
And your right's in a grip

1865
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:47,240
Watch his right hand slip

1866
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:55,200
Gee whiz

1867
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:04,200
bigger than I am

1868
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:08,960
He disagrees

1869
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:49,120
I'm hot like the prodigal son

1870
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,680
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe

1871
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:58,640
You're the chosen one

1872
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:30,640
MAY: Who was it?
Who hit you?

1873
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:31,960
PETER: Some guy.

1874
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,760
So itchy, man, God.

1875
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:35,120
MAY: What's
"some guy's" name?

1876
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,760
Uh, Steve.

1877
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:38,920
Steve? From 12-C?

1878
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:41,000
With the overbite?
No, no, no.

1879
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:42,800
You don't know him.
He's from Brooklyn.

1880
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:46,840
Ouch.

1881
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:47,960
Well...

1882
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:50,520
I hope you got
a few good licks in.

1883
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:53,120
Yeah, I got
quite a few in, actually.

1884
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,440
His friend was huge.
Like huge.

1885
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:01,640
That's way better.
Thank you.

1886
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,280
Okay, tough guy.

1887
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:08,840
Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?
