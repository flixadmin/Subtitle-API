1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Syberia from GVN & HDVNbits.org

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Robot - Endhiran

3
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,430
Doctor?
- Hm...

4
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,400
There's a courier for you. Sender ' Sana'.

5
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,470
Item "flowers". Message ' Miss You'.
- Leave it there!

6
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,470
Run the processor.

7
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,450
Good! This is how to start.

8
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,420
You idiot!

9
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,100
Serve you right.

10
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,280
He kicks like an unborn baby in the
mother's womb.

11
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,270
What damage will he do when he is complete?

12
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,200
Coffee?
- Thank you R2R.

13
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,270
Hey, get me a fltered coffee?

14
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,460
No coffee for Grade 2, only water.

15
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,270
Hey idiot, what about a Grade 3 than?
- Self service.

16
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,470
There is no respect for humans in this lab.

17
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,050
Walk like me.

18
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,290
I'll start the data transfer, check the connection.

19
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,050
He even poses like Bruce Lee.

20
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,230
Don't you check emails or sms's in your lab?

21
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,260
Where is he? Why does he need a girlfriend?

22
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,330
Is he still alive?

23
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,500
He is busy. He'll get angry if anyone disturbs.

24
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,270
Let it be, tell him I am here.
- Go fast!

25
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,330
Sana, do you have a sister?
- No!

26
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,410
How many times have I told you not to
disturb me? Get out!

27
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,290
He threw the metal on my head.

28
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,350
Not even Obama can see him now.

29
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,080
Did you tell him it's me?
- Yes! He asked you to call later.

30
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,060
Ask him to throw his handphone!

31
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,000
Tell him that I'll never meet him after this!

32
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,290
Give it some speech training, I'll be back shortly.

33
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,480
"Hey macha!". Repeat?

34
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,090
What is that look for?

35
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,060
Donkey! Idiot!

36
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,070
Answer us, you metal head!

37
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,070
Did you teach it something useful?
- We...

38
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,040
...didn't expect you back so soon.
- Tell me!

39
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,370
"Hey macha!". Repeat?

40
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,040
"What is that look for? '

41
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,140
"Donkey! Idiot!"

42
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,050
"Answer us, you metal head!"

43
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,290
What's all this? Is this speech training?

44
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,330
Not me, it was Siva.

45
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,290
I wanted to start from Chennai Tamil and
proceed to proper Tamil...

46
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,340
This is my 10 years effort!

47
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,330
I'll punish you severely if you repeat this
again!

48
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,250
So, you think you can get us into trouble?

49
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,370
I will dismantle and send you to a
metal dealer!

50
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,380
Let's go before we get bitten.

51
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,280
Success! Next is the ARD approval right?

52
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,080
No Siva. Although he's been fully
programmed...

53
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,250
...he's still a machine, like a new born baby.

54
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,290
We must observe how he uses his
knowledge...

55
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,320
...and behaves among real people.

56
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,500
Only then can we take him to ARD.

57
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,170
Let him mingle?
- Dot!

58
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,330
It's going to get interesting now.

59
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm coming!

60
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,280
It's been months since we last saw him.

61
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,300
Ruining his health with all those researches.

62
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,410
Hi mum!
- Vasi, you look like a priest on a holiday.

63
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,210
Hi dad! I have a surprise for you.
- What is it?

64
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,250
What's this? Did you clone yourself?
- No dad!

65
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,360
Don't confuse us. Who are you?

66
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,130
He's worse than you.

67
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,280
Dad, I created him. There are many types
of robots.

68
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,210
This is an andro humanoid robot, a machine
that resembles human.

69
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,480
This is mother.
- Mother!

70
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,210
Yes, now show your respect.

71
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,120
It behaves like a human?

72
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,320
It can do everything a human can and can't do.

73
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,090
So you don't need them anymore.

74
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,230
No dad, I still need them.

75
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,090
Who else will clean and dress the robot?

76
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,410
You are turning a MSC graduate into a
babysitter?

77
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,460
Vasi, come and eat.

78
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,330
Robot, join us. I'll serve you hot idly.

79
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,070
What? You'll even give him curry and meat.

80
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,290
Mum, it only needs 2 units of electricity daily.

81
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,190
Why didn't you name him yet?

82
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,390
Mum, choose a name for him.

83
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,330
If you had a brother, I wanted to name him
Chitti Babu.

84
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,490
We can call him Chitti.

85
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,490
Chitti, go and drop the TV.

86
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,410
Mum, he will do exactly as told.

87
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,010
You must tell him to switch it on.

88
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Where are you leaving to so soon?
To the lab?

89
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,250
No, I am need a haircut and to meet Sana.
She's angry.

90
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,250
Who will drive?
- Chitti!

91
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,290
Doctor, please don't. It's risky.

92
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,530
Are you coming?
- No, my stomach is upset. You go ahead.
- I haven't informed my parents, you go ahead.

93
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,030
Careful doctor, he might break the gearbox.

94
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,040
That's why I am here.
- He broke the TVwhile you are here.

95
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,450
Just follow my instructions.

96
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,250
Don't do anything without my permission.

97
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,150
Ok doctor, where to go?
- The park.

98
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,320
Idiot, why didn't hit the break?

99
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,060
You told me not to do anything without
your permission.

100
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,230
Hey fool, are you drunk?
- No, this car uses petrol.

101
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,200
Don't answer all these, let's go.

102
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,480
Don't cut very short, just 1/4 inch is enough.

103
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,280
I will cut as if I'm cutting fngernails.

104
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Haven't seen you in awhile. Was it a vow?
- No, just work.

105
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Is he your brother?
- Yes!

106
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,090
Do you need a hair cut?
- No, I'm using a wig.

107
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,090
Wig? How old is he?
- 1 day.

108
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,130
He's fooling us.

109
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
Here, read these books.

110
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,040
Is he counting the pages?

111
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,210
Any other books?

112
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,390
Have you fnished reading?
- Yes!

113
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,050
There's only the telephone directory left.

114
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,370
You fnished reading it too?
- Yes!

115
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,200
Do you know all the numbers?
- Yes!

116
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,370
What is Kamalhassan's number?

117
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,280
Everyone knows it. Tell me my number.

118
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,220
What is your name?
- Bhajanlal.

119
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,260
There are 12 Bhajanlal's. Tell me your initial?
- K. Bhajanlal.

120
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,400
There are 3 K. Bhajanlal's. Tell me your address?

121
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,390
No 6, Mannaradi Street, Sowcapet.

122
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,240
My number is 44433321. Tell me my name?

123
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,410
Hello Mr P. Pithambaram.

124
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,420
Hi sweetheart!
- Broken heart! What?

125
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,100
I was very busy in the lab.

126
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,120
Remain there, who asked you to come here?

127
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,470
I understand that you are angry.

128
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,440
How many phone calls, sms's and mails?

129
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,270
How many times did I come there?

130
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,210
Did you speak a word to me?

131
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,080
I hate you.
- Look here Sana...

132
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,450
I don't know what is happening around me
when I'm at work.

133
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,490
If you knew what I was doing...
- Excuse me! I have a class now.

134
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,480
Come to jeeva Park in the evening and we'll
talk further.

135
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,460
I love you! We'll meet in the evening.

136
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm meeting you to end our relationship,
not to romance.

137
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,430
End the relationship! What do you mean?

138
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,430
If we marry, you'll be too occupied for me.

139
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,500
Rather than getting divorced later, let's end
our relationship now.

140
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,400
I'll go my way, and you go your way.

141
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,450
This is the document to end our relationship.

142
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,100
Here are the letters and greeting cards you
sent to me.

143
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,460
Look at the book that you gave me.

144
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,070
You gave me Lord Muruga's photo for
Valentines.

145
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,030
Have you ever bought me anything special?

146
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Is this the one?

147
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,270
Will anyone present a shaver to a girl?

148
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,440
I thought you might need it.
- Your face!

149
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I returned everything that you gave me.

150
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,130
Please sign this. There's nothing between us
anymore.

151
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,430
Is that all?
- Yes!

152
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,430
Have you returned everything?
- Yes!

153
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,090
What about the 512 kisses that I gave you?

154
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,070
You even count the kisses you gave me?

155
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,040
Don't you ever feel anything?

156
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,440
I can't return that.
- Only than it's offcial.

157
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,380
It's unfair, I won't agree to it.

158
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,340
I will not sign the documents then.

159
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,340
He is so annoying!

160
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,180
Close your eyes!

161
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,220
What is this?

162
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,160
Is this how I kissed you?
- Then?

163
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,270
Held your hips, hold you tight...

164
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,210
I won't do it.
- Our deal is cancelled then.

165
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,270
I will disturb you every day.
- You are a torture!

166
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,470
Let everything end today.

167
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,040
Come near.

168
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,340
Close your eyes.

169
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,340
Don't smile.

170
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,280
Is it ok?
- Too much gap.

171
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,330
Closer...

172
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,200
What is this?
- Star fruit.

173
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,430
Star fruit?
- Where's the driver?

174
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,440
Which driver? There are so many drivers.

175
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,450
Engine driver, taxi driver, screwdriver.

176
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,350
Where's the driver of this car?
- It's me.

177
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,090
Why did you park at a no parking area?
- It only stated no parking.

178
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,060
It did not state no parking Dr. Vasegaran's car.

179
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,280
Are you making fun of me?
- No, I'm answering you.

180
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,300
Show me your driving license?
- I don't have one.

181
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,030
How can you drive without a license?
- It's been programmed.

182
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Don't try to fool me, follow me to the station.
- Which station?

183
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,000
Are you making fun?

184
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,110
What is your name?
- Chitti!

185
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,080
Tell me your address?
- I only have IP address.

186
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,310
Your answers are not related.

187
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,440
What is your father's name?
- I don't have one.

188
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,220
Mother?
- I don't have one.

189
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,410
Are you an orphan?
- No.

190
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,380
How were you born then?
- I wasn't born, I was made.

191
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,260
They made you? Are you mad?
- No. Everything is ftted tightly.

192
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,060
Are you trying to be funny?
- No, the bolts are made of nickel.

193
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,060
Stop it!
- Tell me exactly what to stop.

194
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,370
Why must we argue? It's a parking offence.

195
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,200
You don't have a driving licence, and you talk
a lot.

196
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,140
You'll be fned Rs1000 if you go to court.

197
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,450
Do you want to go to court or settle it here?

198
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,250
I will settle it here.
- That's the way.

199
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,160
I have looked at you.
- Don't make me angry.

200
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,100
Don't you know how to settle?

201
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Give me a cut.
- Where to give?

202
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,190
In my hand. Do it quick.

203
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,170
He sliced my hand!

204
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,440
Chitti, what happened?
- He asked me to cut, so I cut.

205
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,380
Who is he? He looks like you.
- Get in the car and I'll tell you.

206
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,480
Let's go.
- Wait, don't go.

207
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,280
Is he your brother? Are you twins?
- No.

208
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,450
Drive fast, we'll be in trouble if we get
caught.

209
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,430
Is he your friend?
- No.

210
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,430
Driver? He doesn't look like one.

211
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,460
I'll tell you in detail. Just see if they are
following us.

212
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,400
Turn your head.

213
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,010
Why do you simply turn your head?

214
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,450
You told me to check if they are following us.

215
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,350
You can use the rear view mirror.
- You should have told me.

216
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,390
He is equal to a hundred men.

217
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,400
Knowledge equal to a hundred men has been
programmed into him.

218
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,200
He knows all the arts and languages of
this world.

219
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,420
His eyes are not just to see, but also to show.

220
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,260
We can speak to him virtually.

221
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,050
With these type of robots...

222
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,260
...our nation's security will be enhanced
by a hundred times.

223
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,330
You may ask Chitti any questions.

224
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,110
I will ask a simple question. Is 24157817 a
Fibonacci number?

225
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,180
Yes. It's the 22nd Fibonacci number.

226
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,270
It is also Mandavali P. Subramaniam's
phone number.

227
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,110
What is the biggest prime number that
you know?

228
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,360
M 44, it'll take you several years to fgure out
if it is right or wrong.

229
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,000
What rhythm is this?

230
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,400
You started and fnished in a different rhythm,
and in between...

231
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,510
...you went slightly off key at this point.

232
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,520
Does God exists?
- Who is God?

233
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,090
The one who created us.

234
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,220
Dr Vaseegaran created me, so God does exist.

235
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,480
Such a wonderful creation.

236
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,460
Do you know how to paint?
- Yes.

237
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,290
Can you sketch a portrait of me?
- Sure.

238
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,310
Can I take a picture with you?
- Sure.

239
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,510
See how they are fussing over him?

240
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,120
Hi, I'm the co-scientist. I fxed all his motors.

241
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm the deputy scientist, Ravi.

242
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,390
Deputy scientist?
- It means labourer.

243
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,100
I am in charge of his clothes.

244
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,170
Why are all of you interested in him?

245
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,430
He may have the capability of a hundred men...

246
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,510
...but he doesn't have one important part
that we have.

247
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,420
What is the one thing they have that I don't?

248
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,470
Why didn't you give it to me?
- He has complained to him.

249
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Don't you know what to talk to him?

250
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,220
No, what we meant was his lack of emotions...

251
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,420
Don't change the story.

252
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,220
Your 1 month salary will be deducted.

253
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,260
You have told me.

254
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,170
The head of ARD, your mentor.

255
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,500
His picture is in our lab.

256
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,470
What about your motors?

257
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,160
Can you tell me about your neural scheme?
- No.

258
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,090
Why?

259
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,290
I'm Vaseegaran's professor, you can tell me.
There's no harm.

260
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,300
Let me check and confrm.
- No! No!

261
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,240
He's asking about my neural scheme,
should I tell?

262
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,040
It is not wrong that you asked, but...

263
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,270
...I hesitate to tell anyone before I get it
patented...

264
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,180
...because it can be easily misused.

265
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,080
I just asked him casually to test his
knowledge.

266
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,360
After I complete my study on him, I will
bring him to you...

267
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,330
...for the ARD evaluation.

268
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,510
Vasi, I like Chitti very much.

269
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,210
Can I take him home for two days?

270
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,340
Is he a doll or teddy bear to keep for
two days?

271
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,180
No Vasi, it's my fnal exams. I did not...

272
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,380
...study properly as I was upset with you.

273
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,580
Chitti can help me if he's around.

274
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,120
Ok, take him. You both follow them.

275
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,120
Gents are not allowed in my home.
- Who said we are gents?

276
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,520
It's ok, call me if there's anything.

277
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Idiot, walk forward.

278
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,150
Walk forward.

279
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,230
Not bun, it's gun!

280
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,290
I programmed you with 8 lakhs worth of
line of codes.

281
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,120
I told you to take gun, but you took bun.

282
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,430
Vaseegaran is my student, he achieved it.

283
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:11,290
His creation received a standing ovation
at the conference.

284
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,070
You lie upside down and...

285
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,240
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

286
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,240
Let go of my neck.

287
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,370
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

288
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,180
What does happy home mean?

289
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,410
Dad was an army offcer. At the age of 40...

290
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,120
...he died in the Cargill War.

291
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,420
We were very sad and depressed.

292
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,280
We wondered how long we were going to
suffer like this.

293
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,020
How many of them would have lost their
husbands or sons?

294
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,360
We started this to show them love and care.

295
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,070
No one can change the past or stop
the future.

296
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,270
For now, let everyone just be happy.

297
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,070
That is why it's named Happy Home.

298
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,240
Is your baby kicking you?

299
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,080
I'll ask him to kick you once he's out.

300
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,220
Who is he? Why allow gents in here?

301
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,310
Is he your boyfriend?

302
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,360
Not boyfriend, but toy friend.

303
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,190
His Chitti, and he is a robot.

304
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,460
Robot? Are you lying?
- It's true.

305
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
Don't scare them, put it back.

306
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,540
Mum, you'll be amazed by his capabilities.

307
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,350
Can it cook?
- Yes!

308
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,370
Prepare something to eat, while I have
my shower.

309
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,250
One more day left, and a lot more to study.

310
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:44,210
I'll tell you what I studied, stop me if
I'm wrong.

311
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,430
Have you studied all?

312
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,260
Ok, I will test you.

313
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,040
What are Monozygotic and Di-zygotic twins?

314
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,410
You can become a doctor in one day if you
study like this.

315
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,240
Can't bear their nuisance every day.

316
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,380
Why is it so noisy? Reduce the volume.

317
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,450
I spent Rs 10 lakhs to buy a deck,
amplifer and woofer...

318
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,130
...and you expect us to use headphones?

319
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,330
Many of them are studying for exams.

320
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,030
There are heart patients as well.

321
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,070
Ask them to cover their ears with cottons.

322
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
Chitti, do something.
- Don't worry.

323
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,250
Remote control uses infrared, I'll handle it.

324
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,440
Shut your ears!

325
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,160
Reduce the volume.

326
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:08,330
It's too loud, can you reduce it?

327
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,250
We are celebrating our temple's festival...

328
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,120
...and you ask us to reduce the volume?

329
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,380
We can't study for exams.

330
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,080
Pray to God and go, you'll pass
your exams.

331
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,090
You do the same when you organise any
party.

332
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,420
No more disturbance, let's go.

333
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,460
He broke our set.
- Hey, stop there.

334
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,460
I said stop.

335
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:47,490
Goddess Kali!

336
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,330
What's this?

337
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,110
He is a magician.
- He took all our weapons.

338
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,150
Why are you crying?
- I will defnitely fail.

339
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,380
I have not studied at all. I'm running
out of time.

340
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,240
My head is spinning just looking at
this book.

341
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,510
Shall I write on your behalf?
- You don't understand.

342
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,160
You can't write because we have photo id
and an exam card.

343
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,130
Then, we'll do a zig-B.
- What is that?

344
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,210
What are you doing here?

345
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,290
Sana is doing her exam and I'm giving her
the answers.

346
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,450
How can you do it from here?

347
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,490
I have a built in data transmitter.

348
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,080
Sana has a trans receiver in her ear.

349
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,460
Is this a high-tech bit?
- Not bit, it's byte.

350
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,200
I have sent 2Mb of data so far.
- See how they cheat these days?

351
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,140
Wait, I'll come as soon as the umbilical cord
detached.

352
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,510
What?
- You better come before I call the security.

353
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,080
He said you have a trans receiver and you're
receiving answers from him.

354
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,180
Who said?
- I did.

355
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,120
I don't know him.
- Why are you lying?

356
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,430
He's blabbering, I think he is mad.

357
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,200
I don't have brains, only a CPU and it's in a
perfect condition.

358
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,100
No doubt he's mental.

359
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,130
I assumed he's an old student when I saw
him talking to himself.

360
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,580
You may leave now and continue detaching
he umbilical cord.

361
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,170
Sana, how are you going to answer the
questions?

362
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,250
Let her deal with it, you leave frst.

363
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,290
I would have defnitely failed if you had not
helped me.

364
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,090
Why dirty my cheeks for that?

365
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,200
They will ban me for three years if I was
caught cheating.

366
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,170
That's why I had to tell them that I didn't
know you.

367
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,100
Please don't be upset.
- I don't have feelings.

368
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,080
I learned that humans will lie to protect
themselves.

369
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,350
Leave this place, go to the next compartment.

370
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,080
He's the one.

371
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,330
Are you a thug? Fight now!

372
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,300
What are you looking at? You can't grab
anything now.

373
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,330
We attached rocks to it.
- Come now.

374
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,140
Why are they calling?
- Keep quiet.

375
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,410
You brought him the other day, ask him
to fght now.

376
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,450
Chitti, my purse! I have my hall ticket and
id in it.

377
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,080
You destroyed my home theatre system...

378
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,450
...now I will destroy you.

379
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,450
Hold her!

380
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,430
Chitti, beat them up.

381
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,450
Hold him tight.

382
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:59,440
You'll be amazed to know what Chitti did.

383
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,430
If only he was human, I would have fallen for
him instead of you.

384
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,030
Why do you look upset?
- No!

385
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,340
Whatever he does, the credit goes to you.

386
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,180
My love will always belong to you.

387
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:59,380
What? You are looking as though there's a
salsa dance.

388
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,190
Are you planning to complaint about this too?

389
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,090
I'm troubleshooting peripheral's for
tomorrow's ARD evaluation.

390
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,250
Are you so special?
- What you said is wrong.

391
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,360
He thinks he is a poet.

392
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,370
A famous poet once said this.
- Stop it!

393
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:21,340
We don't care who and what was said.

394
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,110
You think you are better just because...

395
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,510
...your knowledge is better than us?
- Yes!

396
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,310
What? Can you drink like us?

397
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,280
Can you smoke like us?
- Can you eat briyani?

398
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,040
Can you vomit after eating?

399
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,350
Can you spit?
- Can you urinate against the wall?

400
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,450
Is that the only difference between human
and me?

401
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,330
It seems like sarcasm
- Yes, it is.

402
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,330
My rule list says that I should not consume all
these.

403
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,520
That rule list also says that you must listen
to us right?

404
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,470
Yes!
- Then drink this.

405
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,400
Eat this briyani.

406
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,400
Wait, let me confrm with the doctor.
- Don't inform the doctor!

407
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,110
They asked me to consume alcohol and
eat briyani.

408
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,600
It's against the rule list. What should I do?

409
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,240
Beat them with slippers.

410
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:09,180
Give me your slippers.
- Slippers? Take it!

411
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,410
Are you going to eat it?
- He might.

412
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,220
He's really hitting us.

413
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,270
Everyone is looking at us, it's embarrassing.
Stop it Chitti.

414
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,430
Task incomplete.
- Incomplete?

415
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,080
Serves you right.
- We don't want.

416
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,210
Do you have brains?
- No!

417
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,050
I told you to prepare him for tomorrow's
evaluation...

418
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,210
...but you ask him to do nonsense.
- He's lying.

419
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,210
Machines won't lie, only humans does.

420
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,270
Human life is so precious.

421
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,540
Many armed soldiers die in the war.

422
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,480
Many families lose their members.

423
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,380
We won't suffer losses if we use robots
instead of humans.

424
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,520
My intention was to create many andro
humanoid robots...

425
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,140
...and deliver them to our armed force.

426
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,550
ARD's approval is compulsory for this to
happen.

427
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,990
I humbly request all the scientist and offcers
here...

428
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:23,460
...to evaluate Chitti and grant me the approval.

429
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,100
Is this robot built not to endanger human life...

430
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,120
...as stated in the ASIMO rules?

431
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,430
This robot is not created in such a way...

432
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:36,170
...because it may have to kill the life of an
enemy in war.

433
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,220
Greek Ecklas said that in a tortoise race...

434
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,460
...even if the tortoise leaves early...

435
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,420
...it will win the race. Do you know that?
- Yes!

436
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:03,030
In reality, because of its seriousness, even
Ecklas can win the race.

437
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,970
What do you think? Should we approve?

438
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,240
Do you know the value of a human life?

439
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,380
It depends on which life.

440
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:20,050
If in danger, who would you save?
Einstein or a child?

441
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,290
Turn around! Walk!

442
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,480
Stab Vaseegaran.

443
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,340
It's a dangerous machine. It can kill anyone.

444
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,270
It can't be approved.

445
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:17,400
You confused it by giving unwanted commands.

446
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,070
It doesn't know good, bad, friends or enemies.

447
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,210
If allowed in our armed force...

448
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:31,090
...it might kill our own men instead of enemies.

449
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,460
It is dangerous to be let out.

450
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,390
It has sliced a traffc police's hand.

451
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,400
It thrashed an electric train and broke some
passenger's bones.

452
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,060
It is only suitable to work in a factory.

453
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,210
Are you angry with me?

454
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,010
I'm not angry with you.

455
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,440
I just don't want science to be misinterpreted.

456
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,440
What you did was wrong.

457
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,570
What was my mistake?

458
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:24,040
You told me to do as he says.

459
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,380
Must you stab if he tells you to?

460
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,040
That is the meaning of stab.

461
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,710
Please help!

462
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,430
We can't go near the fre.

463
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,730
There are many people still trapped inside.

464
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,700
Send extra forces immediately.

465
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,630
Chitti, can you help them?

466
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,500
I can because my fre resistance is higher
than this.

467
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,130
Chitti, no one must die.

468
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,120
Please help!

469
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,330
Please help!

470
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:20,630
Don't be scared.

471
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,690
I am here to save you.

472
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,380
He saved us on time.

473
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,580
Wonder how many more are still trapped.

474
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,410
Please switch on the TV.

475
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,320
You rejected the robot saying its dangerous...

476
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,410
...watch how it saves lives from the fre.

477
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,020
Please save my son!

478
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,300
Please help me!

479
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,700
Get down!

480
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,470
Check properly if everyone is here.

481
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,680
Who is that?

482
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,690
My daughter is missing. She was having
her bath.

483
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:53,120
I don't know what happened. Please
save her.

484
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,240
Please save me!

485
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,520
Don't come here, I'm nude.

486
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,160
I'm nude as well.
- Let me go.

487
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,400
I am nude. Let me go.

488
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,040
Here is Selvi.

489
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:50,210
What nonsense is this?

490
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,320
Don't snap my picture.

491
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,150
She is nude.
- But, she's alive.

492
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,620
I'm embarrassed they snapped my picture.

493
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,360
Don't go! Please wait! Listen to me!

494
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,080
You killed an innocent girl.

495
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,420
I told you it's a stupid machine and...

496
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,650
...it's dangerous to let it out.

497
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:37,420
You proved me right.

498
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:45,470
Stupid!

499
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,140
Don't you know you should cover her with a
cloth?

500
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,610
How will it know?

501
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,410
It is a humanoid, not human.

502
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,680
How will a machine know self respect?

503
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,540
The media is blasting the coverage video of
the girl's suicide.

504
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,250
The Defence Ministry is pressuring to stop your
research.

505
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,500
No, I can't stop it.

506
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,070
I can make some changes to his scheme.

507
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,500
How can it be?

508
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,090
It doesn't know between a male and female.

509
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:21,530
Doesn't understand shame and emotions.

510
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,500
I can induce human feelings to it.

511
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,610
Only God can do it!

512
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,600
Humans can do it as well, it's proven.

513
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,320
That's why I said it's a waste of time and
energy.

514
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,620
It is my 10 years of work.

515
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,390
Are there no benefts?

516
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,420
Yes, but in a different place.

517
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:50,500
I have contacts with a robotic companies
overseas.

518
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,270
If you hand it to me, I can sell it for a
lot of money.

519
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,340
I did not create it for money.

520
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,540
My ambition is to hand it over to the
armed forces.

521
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,080
It is impossible because it has to...

522
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:07,510
...come to me for evaluation.

523
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,220
Give me one last opportunity.

524
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:16,530
You have 1 month to try.

525
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:21,620
If you can't, dismantle it and buy some dates.

526
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:26,660
It is good for your heart. You will need it.

527
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,380
We have both been working here for the
past 5 years.

528
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,320
We. Only receive insults.

529
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,450
Let us know if there is any vacancy in your lab.

530
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,290
Do you know Chitti's neural scheme?

531
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,490
We know everything except that.

532
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:51,090
I will inform if you are needed.

533
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,360
What are you doing?

534
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,090
I'm installing software hormones.

535
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,360
Hormones will only be effective if we have
feelings.

536
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,420
I am going to do a reverse mapping.

537
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,610
Human life is something extraordinary.

538
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:18,580
Human life is one of its kind in this world.

539
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:22,040
What is life?
- It's a form of DNA.

540
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,450
Is this life?
- Life is not a formula.

541
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,530
How to explain it to you.

542
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:32,460
A bacteria has life, but sodium doesn't.

543
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,660
What about me?
- For you...

544
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:42,260
Be careful!

545
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,190
Is there any changes?
- Yes!

546
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,560
What?
- Your beard grew 0.5mm.

547
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,300
Do you feel any changes within you?
- No!

548
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,100
Everything is wasted! You stupid!

549
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,610
You keep quiet Sana.

550
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:22,340
He won't feel anything, titanium head.

551
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:27,250
I never slept, ate and spoke to you for so long.

552
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,620
I worked hard and taught him many things.

553
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,220
He is standing there without any reaction.

554
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,330
I will dismantle you.

555
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,350
Don't yell at me.

556
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,270
I did everything you asked me to.

557
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:45,600
If it's not happening, the mistake is yours,
not mine.

558
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:50,200
If I am a waste, so are you!
- What did you say?

559
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,640
Let go off me.

560
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,610
Chitti is getting angry.

561
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,720
Lata is in labour pain. It's serious,
come immediately.

562
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:45,560
We have reached. I'm here with you.

563
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,460
Don't be scared.

564
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,100
Is it very complicated?
- You are a student here right?

565
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,700
It's a fetal course, the head has over turned.

566
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,410
She has so many other complications.

567
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:04,280
It's diffcult to save even one life.

568
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,290
Her husband died a few days after marriage.

569
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,290
The only reason she's alive is for this baby.

570
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:14,460
Please help them both.
- I can only try.

571
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,360
The rest is...
- Shall I try?

572
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:21,550
Are you a doctor?
- No. I am a robot.

573
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,460
Chitti, can you do it?

574
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,700
We can't allow this.

575
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:30,400
This is a labour ward not a lab. Both lives are
in danger.

576
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,700
It is a nightmare even for experienced doctors
like us.

577
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,570
I can do it because I studied for Sana's exam.

578
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,510
Not even Sana can do this.

579
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,310
One needs qualifcation and experience to do it.

580
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:44,620
Caesarean is not necessary. Just normal delivery.

581
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,090
How is it possible? Both will die.

582
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,160
We can perform a plasma transfusion.

583
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,650
Her blood pressure is high and fts can occur
at any time.

584
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,700
Normal delivery is impossible.

585
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:01,640
It's possible. We can do it in the traditional way.

586
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,580
Don't make noise, he's scared.

587
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,660
First robot in history to deliver a baby.

588
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,230
The boy looks just like you.

589
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,340
Do you want to see him?

590
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,440
Please switch on the Wi-Fi. I'll video stream the
ultrasound.

591
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,030
This is a milestone in robotics.

592
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:11,340
This is an achievement in artifcial intelligence.

593
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,290
Remain awake, left only 95 seconds.

594
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:32,190
Look here! Open your eyes.

595
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,560
He'll be born at exactly 4;44;44.

596
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,250
We just need 55 seconds more.

597
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,480
35 seconds to go.

598
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,290
Would you approve of Chitti now?
- Defnitely!

599
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:46,360
But your problem starts now.

600
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,400
He saved both the lives.

601
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,600
The story has just begun.

602
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,620
I am very happy today.

603
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,250
Tune to sleeping mode and charge yourself.

604
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,580
What are you doing here?

605
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,620
A mosquito was biting your cheek.

606
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:48,130
Did you come here to hit it?
- No. I came to see you.

607
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,290
This is something new. Please leave.

608
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,430
I liked it when you kissed me today.

609
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:54,520
Kiss me again and I'll go.

610
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,200
What happened to you?

611
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,100
Coming here at this hour. Please leave!

612
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:01,510
Kiss me and I'll leave.
- It's a nuisance.

613
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,270
I kissed you because you achieved something
today.

614
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,440
Is anyone else pregnant here?

615
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,600
Do you think this is a maternity ward?

616
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,070
Tell me what else to achieve?

617
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:14,580
Go catch the mosquito that bit me.
- That's all?

618
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,650
Who bit Sana?
- Not me! I was elsewhere.

619
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:51,660
I'm from a different place. It's Ranguski.

620
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,350
Who's Ranguski?
- I am.
- Yes, so what?

621
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,600
I've even bitten the chief minister.

622
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,270
Come and apologise to her.
- Apologise?

623
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,500
Fulfll my 3 conditions, then I'll consider.

624
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,300
What are those?
- I need AB -ve blood.

625
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:15,480
Very diffcult to get it.
- Siva and Ravi's blood are the same group.

626
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,070
You can drink as much as you want.

627
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:25,610
Abolish all those mosquito repellent companies.

628
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:28,560
Declare us as a national bird.

629
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,260
You are an insect, not a bird.

630
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,430
Times up! Follow me now.
- No!

631
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:37,270
I'll destroy all of you if you refuse to follow.

632
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:41,270
How dare he threaten us?

633
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:43,100
Have humans became so bold?

634
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,540
Have you forgotten how many lives we have
killed?

635
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:48,280
Malaria, dengue and chikugunya diseases?

636
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,710
Let's show him who we are.

637
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:52,680
Bite him!

638
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:02,090
He's very strong. I fractured my sting.

639
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,430
Is it?
- Yes!

640
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,020
Try to enter his mouth.
- Ok!

641
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,230
Dengue Lakshmi is dead.

642
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:19,040
This is similar to an electric bag.

643
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,500
We back off now and will attack later.

644
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,050
You can take Ranguski with you.

645
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:36,560
This is the mosquito that bit you.

646
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,290
Apologise to Sana.

647
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,070
Tell your gang not to come near Sana anymore.

648
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,440
Go!
- Kiss me now.

649
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:32,010
Terrorists wish to use robots instead of humans
for terrorism.

650
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,110
They are willing to pay any amount.

651
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:39,090
They have clients around the world.

652
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,560
He wants to take a look at your model?

653
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,980
They need 100 robots by March.

654
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,590
Here's your advance.

655
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,300
What happened to the robots?

656
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,410
You should have delivered it by now.

657
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:36,480
Instead you are still showing us a skeleton.

658
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,210
It's going through intense testing now.

659
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,580
I'm tuning it to zero defect.

660
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,450
I need at least 1 more month.

661
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,080
Pack this.

662
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,370
For who?
- It's Sana's birthday today.

663
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:19,180
Pack this too.

664
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,160
What's that for?
- I want to give Sana a present too.

665
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,490
I am already giving.
- I want to give too.

666
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:25,690
Who will pay?
- You.

667
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:28,530
Why should I?
- It's my salary.

668
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,730
We don't pay salary to machines.
- I'm not a machine

669
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,300
I'll go on strike if you don't pay me.

670
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,740
I'll refuse to charge myself for 1 week.

671
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,180
You might even ask for a credit card.

672
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,710
No need. I have your credit card number.

673
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,580
I can forge your signature.

674
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:50,380
I can't tolerate him. Pack both.

675
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,250
Who will drive?
- You, I'm on leave today.

676
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,720
It's my time.

677
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,340
Concentrate on the road.

678
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,300
It has been 200,000 hours since you were born.

679
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:27,070
Mum, please remove this.

680
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:33,310
Vasi, how is it?

681
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,690
It's very nice right?

682
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:39,490
I also bought a similar necklace to that.

683
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:42,460
But a gift from Chitti is something special.

684
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,330
I proudly say that I'm the lucky guy...

685
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:15,190
...who is going to marry this beautiful girl.

686
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,790
What are you doing?
- I felt like kissing Sana.

687
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,790
Don't you know it's wrong to kiss another's
girlfriend?

688
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,670
I know but I felt like disobeying it.
- It's wrong.

689
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:35,760
You shouldn't come near her anymore.
- Why?

690
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,370
Because she's my lover.
- I love her too.

691
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:44,680
Don't talk nonsense. Nothing is true.

692
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,610
You are just a machine.

693
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:49,510
Yes, but a machine with feelings.

694
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:55,460
It's for you to understand and act accordingly...

695
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,260
...not to misuse it.

696
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:00,350
I like it and I want Sana!

697
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:06,170
I'm going to marry her.
- You marry someone else.

698
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,240
I created you. This is betrayal.

699
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:14,610
You can let go of your love. This is called
sacrifce.

700
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:16,110
I'll hit you.

701
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,110
I won't feel pain, but you will.

702
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:21,250
I'll dismantle you.
- I don't wish to.
- Vasi, please calm down.

703
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,390
Chitti, please listen to me.

704
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:28,660
You are so humble, why must he shout?

705
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,560
You want me to pamper you?
- Ask him to be quiet.

706
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:40,670
Even if you have emotions, it's impossible to
love a machine.

707
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:44,240
Why is it impossible? In what way am I
lesser than human?

708
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,570
I can look after you better than him.
- He's talking nonsense.

709
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:49,770
Ask him not to interrupt?
- He's so special?

710
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,250
He doesn't even know how to cook.

711
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:55,820
I can cook 25 dishes and speak many
languages.

712
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,680
He'll grow older and eventually die.

713
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,480
I'm immortal and will keep you happy forever.

714
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,420
That's not what I meant.
- What else? Sex?

715
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,200
Is sex everything in life?

716
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:12,570
Won't there be love without sex?
- That's not it.

717
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:16,470
What else? A baby? Many people are impotent.

718
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:19,410
And they are happily adopting children.
- It's not that.

719
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:22,640
What else?
- What ever you do is against nature.

720
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,340
You don't have life and you can't be included in
living things.

721
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:31,380
Only humans can love, and I love Vaseegaran.

722
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:40,430
Only humans will take longer to forget one...

723
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:45,160
...but you just need 1 second to erase memories
about me.

724
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:46,630
Erase it, Chitti.

725
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,170
Who is that?

726
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:29,740
Why are you here?
- I came to console you.

727
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,480
You are my boss's enemy and you rejected me.

728
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,780
I don't wish to talk to you.

729
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:39,210
You wouldn't have had feelings if I never
rejected you.

730
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:44,780
Vaseegaran is treating you badly, not me.

731
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,390
I don't wish to hear anything, you may leave.

732
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:53,230
You are the most advanced robot in the world.

733
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:58,140
He misuses you to do household chores.

734
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:01,740
What has he done for you? Nothing!

735
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:06,280
I'll pamper you if you were with me.

736
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,410
You are polluting me.

737
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,350
I'm making you realise you're worth.

738
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:18,160
You have the right to like anything, including
Sana.

739
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:23,260
Isn't it against the nature?
- No, it's new to nature.

740
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:26,390
Sana loves Vaseegaran.
- Let her.

741
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:30,690
There are people who change their mind and
love others.

742
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:35,170
Sana too might change her mind and love you.

743
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,770
Don't confuse me, I have an army evaluation
tomorrow.

744
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:40,380
I need to troubleshoot my system.

745
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:49,790
You'll be selected and Vaseegaran will be
famous.

746
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:53,730
He'll be happy after marrying Sana...

747
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:00,600
...while you suffer in the army.
- Myself.

748
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,470
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?
- Yes!

749
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,480
This robot is the peak of human intelligence.

750
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:20,390
He is equivalent to 100 soldiers in strength.

751
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:23,590
He can protect the border and also attack
the enemies.

752
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,490
He is a one man army.

753
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,560
I dedicate him to the Indian army.

754
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,250
You can test him now.

755
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:03,130
Sana, who'll make you fall in love.

756
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:09,770
A machine that touches her can turn human...

757
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:12,500
...a human can be turn into a machine.

758
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:17,440
Her hair resembles a black wave.

759
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:22,170
Her forehead resembles the moon.

760
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:27,520
Her eyes are like the Bermuda Triangle.

761
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:33,160
Her lips resembles a barrack of horses.

762
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:39,360
Her hips are so sexy.

763
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:44,140
Next...
- Chitti, stop it!

764
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:48,170
This robot is reciting poetry instead of war.

765
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:53,180
Dear friends, let go of the guns and hold the
shawls.

766
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,180
Let go of the cannons and touch a woman.

767
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,620
Why must there be war with all these weapons?

768
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:01,250
Love will teach enemies to love.

769
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,290
May everyone fall in love.

770
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,130
Don't insult me.

771
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:17,140
You insulted me.

772
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:21,240
What is this?
- You destroyed my ambition.

773
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,670
Please don't cut me.
- I treated you as my own son.

774
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,750
I wish to live, please don't harm me.

775
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:37,520
A machine like you should not exist at all.

776
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:42,590
What was my mistake?
- It was a mistake to create you.

777
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,170
Did I ask you to create me?

778
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,530
Did I ask you to induce feelings into me?

779
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:53,670
Did I ask Sana to kiss me?

780
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,340
You made all the mistakes...

781
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:02,480
...but you destroy me now just as I want to live.

782
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:07,780
Is this fair?
- Stop talking.

783
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,650
Let me go!

784
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,430
I want Sana!

785
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,530
Let it go, I am also feeling sad.

786
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:34,200
Why are you still thinking of it?

787
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,340
What if Chitti is gone?

788
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,610
You can create a hundred Chitti's.

789
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,790
I did not treat him as a machine.

790
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:49,550
I brought you out so that you'll forget it.

791
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,760
Divert your mind.

792
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:56,620
I thought Chitti was my lifetime achievement.

793
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:15,910
Are you following me to the beach?
- No, you go ahead.

794
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:19,480
I'll defnitely end our relationship if you don't
follow me.

795
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,550
I'll accept whoever I meet frst as my boyfriend.

796
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:41,600
Please wait.

797
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:45,670
What's your name?
- I'm Pachamuthu.

798
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:50,710
Can you be my boyfriend for 1 day?
- 1 day boyfriend?

799
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,740
Same as the 1 day chief minister.

800
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:57,290
You are so pretty but I'm dark and ugly.

801
01:42:57,290 --> 01:42:59,690
Can I be your boyfriend?
- Yes!

802
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:06,260
Thank you! I can't believe this is happening.

803
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,700
What do you have for your girlfriend?

804
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,530
Some thodi and salted fsh.
- Give it to me.

805
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,750
It's smelly!
- It's very nice.

806
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:37,130
I don't want.
- May I?

807
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,560
It will never work out, I'm leaving.

808
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:50,770
Why are you holding my arm?

809
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:57,750
How can you leave after instigating me?

810
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,810
He's my boyfriend. I did this to make him
jealous.

811
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:03,590
Let me go!
- Am I the victim?

812
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:07,120
Satisfy me before you go.
- Let me go!

813
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,430
No matter who comes, I will never let you go.

814
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,100
Let her go.

815
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,210
She's mine today. You come back tomorrow.

816
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,740
I will kill you.
- I'll chop you.

817
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:36,380
I know the IG. I'll send you to prison.

818
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:39,190
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life...

819
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,560
...in prison after satisfying myself with a girl
like her.

820
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,190
You call the cops.
- Chitti would have thrashed him now.

821
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:49,130
Why did you remind me of Chitti now?

822
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,170
There's only 1 way.

823
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,650
Run! Run!

824
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:54,730
What happened? I can't contact Chitti virtually.

825
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:58,330
He disposed of Chitti for failing in the
army evaluation.

826
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,240
They would have dumped it at the dumping area.

827
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,180
Where?
- In Perunkoodi.

828
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:13,180
What did you do to change his heart?

829
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:18,590
When shall we have the wedding?
- I have not achieved anything yet.

830
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:20,230
After I create another robot...

831
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:23,230
I'll kill you if you talk about another robot
again.

832
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:25,390
Isn't one broken TV enough?

833
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:29,790
Uncle, if there is a thaali let's fnish the
ceremony now.

834
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,570
I understand your urgency.

835
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:35,170
Exchange rings now, and we'll have the
wedding later.

836
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,800
Take me to professor Bohra.

837
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:52,780
The world is very small.

838
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:14,400
Please help me, professor.

839
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:18,310
Change me back to what I was.

840
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:23,180
I want to live, I want Sana.

841
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:26,350
I want your neural scheme.

842
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:32,120
Take whatever you want. Please change me
back to Chitti.

843
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,190
I'll defnitely change you.

844
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:17,170
What's this new red chip? It's not Chitti's.

845
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:24,400
It's a destruction program, additional program
for Chitti.

846
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:36,280
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

847
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:40,790
I gave it strength to destroy humans.

848
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:45,730
In summary, he's a destroyer.

849
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:49,230
I'm worried, why are you changing him?

850
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:52,300
He's the growth for my business.

851
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:56,770
Proft is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

852
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,560
I want to meet Sana.
- She's not at home.

853
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:56,770
She'll be at the wedding hall.
- Why?

854
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,400
Today is Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding.

855
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:26,160
Chitti, how come you...

856
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:38,380
Chitti, stop!

857
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:50,420
Even if you force me, I only love Vaseegaran.

858
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,150
I wish to live with him.

859
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:56,420
Only if he's still alive.

860
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,600
I'll commit suicide if you harm him.

861
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:21,110
I spare his life because of you.

862
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:09,190
Madam, come out!

863
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:55,180
The robot you created has killed many offcers!

864
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,990
We are going to take action against you.

865
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:00,230
This is not the robot I created.

866
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:02,420
I dismantled and threw it away.

867
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,230
I don't understand all these.

868
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:07,600
Tell us how to fnd and stop the robot.

869
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,620
It's my responsibility to fnd it.

870
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:15,600
Why are you disturbing me?
- What happened to you?

871
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:18,210
Your system is corrupted and I must
troubleshoot it.

872
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,270
Come to the lab with Sana.
- I won't listen to you anymore.

873
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:25,780
I created you.
- You already threw me away.

874
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:28,220
There's nothing between us after this.

875
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:34,230
Do not disturb me anymore.
- Don't blabber.

876
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:35,590
You are just a machine.

877
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:38,390
I created you and I can also destroy you.

878
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:41,290
Bring Sana back.

879
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:56,510
No one can destroy me.

880
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:16,130
Cash, cheque or credit card?
- Gun!

881
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:21,610
Alert all the cops to inspect vehicles from
T. Nagar.

882
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:43,330
Chitti just robbed city centre. Cover all the
areas.

883
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:44,660
Go to Dr Radhakrishnan Road.

884
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:04,680
We received information that Chitti is at the
petrol station.

885
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:29,570
Robot has entered the harbour

886
02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:32,240
You follow him at a distance.

887
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:34,180
The coast guard will take care of the rest.

888
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:55,200
We have collected the parts of the robot.

889
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:04,670
This is not Chitti.

890
02:06:05,810 --> 02:06:08,510
This is not my creation. The parts are different.

891
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:12,480
It's confusing, he robbed four places at the
same time.

892
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,650
The four places are in different locations.

893
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:17,090
How could he have done it?

894
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:20,120
I suspect someone.

895
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:55,550
No one can destroy me.

896
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:24,390
What are you doing?
- I am cloning myself.

897
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:28,720
Our population will accumulate.

898
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,130
I will not allow this.

899
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,400
I am not Vaseegaran to seek your approval.

900
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:45,410
Look, I have received money from dealers,
they will...

901
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:48,750
...kill me if I don't deliver the robots in two days.
- Go and die!

902
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,450
Ungrateful dog!

903
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:54,380
You back stab your own master.

904
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,050
Delete all the programmes you created, else
I'll kill her.

905
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:05,520
Don't try anything stupid. Delete the
programmes.

906
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:16,130
Order us to shoot him.

907
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:24,580
He is my master, only I can kill him.

908
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:49,530
"Suddenly the robot entered... '

909
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:54,410
"...and ordered us to leave. It also killed two
security guards."

910
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,650
"Because the robots have captured the ARD..."

911
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:04,190
"...cops evacuated the citizens due to security
purpose."

912
02:09:04,190 --> 02:09:07,520
"The cops are trying to..."

913
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:55,540
This is our palace. I'm the king and you are
my queen.

914
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:57,410
I have collected everything that you like.

915
02:09:57,410 --> 02:10:00,170
I brought everything that you may need.

916
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:10,480
This is our bedroom, we'll live here happily
after marriage.

917
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:14,250
Why you keep repeating what you said?

918
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:19,150
It will never happen.
- It will.

919
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:23,290
I am prepared to live with you.

920
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:28,330
I can give you the same happiness as a human.

921
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:32,570
Don't you understand?
- I am creating a system.

922
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:36,470
We can program the type of baby we want...

923
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:39,320
...and inject it into your uterus...

924
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:42,410
...you'll be the frst to give birth to such a baby.

925
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:52,630
Don't try to pretend.

926
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:56,430
You can't escape from here and you can't even
commit suicide.

927
02:10:56,430 --> 02:11:00,270
I'll do it against your wishes and you...

928
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:03,140
...have no choice other than to surrender to me.

929
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,340
Do we have to go that far?

930
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:26,460
Get permission from the Electricity Department.

931
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:29,020
Disconnect the power in the area according to
my order.

932
02:11:29,670 --> 02:11:33,240
Prepare a similar lorry as the one blasted at the
harbour...

933
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:36,400
...and fll it up with water instead of petrol.

934
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:26,690
Gather at the database room at 8.00 pm...

935
02:12:26,690 --> 02:12:29,160
...to obtain new information.

936
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:31,860
Your censors have been collaborated...

937
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:36,220
...and is ready to be collected from hardware
section at 2.00am tomorrow.

938
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:41,210
Recharge time has been reduced to 10 minutes.

939
02:12:48,610 --> 02:12:50,450
Body temperature is high.

940
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:53,210
Choose lower calories and avoid red meat.

941
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:24,150
There's a peculiar sound from your system.

942
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,620
I don't hear any noise.

943
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:29,190
Your microphone is not functioning?

944
02:13:29,190 --> 02:13:31,550
Let me fx the problem.

945
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:42,160
Sana, it's me Vaseegaran.

946
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,370
I came looking for you.

947
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:13,900
Take me away from here.

948
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:15,770
I'm very scared.
- Don't be scared.

949
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:17,530
I have planned everything well.

950
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:21,200
I can't take you without destroying Chitti.

951
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:23,870
Only you can help to destroy Chitti.

952
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:29,180
Just pretend and grab his attention for the
next 24 hours.

953
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,670
I'll take care of the rest.

954
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:43,860
There's a confusion between the robots.
- What happened?

955
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:46,190
A different robot delivered the meal for
Your Highness.

956
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,790
A different robot is repairing the cctv camera.

957
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:55,610
Good news commander.
- What?

958
02:14:55,610 --> 02:14:58,510
Her Highness has eaten and wants to meet you
immediately.

959
02:15:11,890 --> 02:15:13,150
Switch it off.

960
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:29,670
What happened?

961
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:15,310
We are both the best creations of humans.

962
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:26,860
Why this sudden change?
- I realised your love is true.

963
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:31,270
I can't believe it.
- I thought about it carefully...

964
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:35,230
You helped and cared for me a lot.

965
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:38,900
Your only mistake was to love me.

966
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:44,340
You came back for me right?

967
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:50,710
It's so nice to hear...

968
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:57,060
...but I suspect you are trying to deceive me.

969
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:00,390
Can anyone lie to you?

970
02:17:02,330 --> 02:17:06,530
This is my engagement ring from Vaseegaran.

971
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,780
What happened to the power?

972
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:21,190
The whole city has no power.
- Switch on the generator.

973
02:22:21,190 --> 02:22:24,150
Someone poured water instead of petrol...

974
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:02,790
What are you doing?

975
02:23:02,990 --> 02:23:05,200
Don't come near, or I'll shoot you.

976
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,160
Why behave like a small kid?

977
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:35,450
I didn't expect our plan to fail.

978
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:39,150
There's only one way to distract Chitti, do as
I say.

979
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:02,750
Did Vaseegaran come here?
- No.

980
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:04,490
That's a lie. It is a human flaw.

981
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:06,360
You taught me that. Have you forgotten?

982
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:08,790
Your body language shows that you are lying.

983
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:13,130
I swear. I think it's mine.

984
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:17,230
Why don't you say it's mine? You are O+,
that is AB-.

985
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,500
He was here.

986
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:25,670
A different robot delivered the meal.

987
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:28,470
The camera malfunctioned for 10 minutes.

988
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:30,710
Your sudden change in behaviour...

989
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:33,740
...power failure, water in the generator...

990
02:24:37,150 --> 02:24:38,710
Vaseegaran is here.

991
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:43,490
Are you trying to cheat me?
- No.

992
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:47,230
Your love is not true.
- Believe me.

993
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:52,830
Do you really love me?
- Yes.

994
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:59,800
Vaseegaran should not live. Let's kill him.

995
02:25:11,390 --> 02:25:15,220
A man has come here to destroy us.

996
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:19,230
We must fnd and kill him.

997
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:29,230
I'll kill you gently if you surrender.

998
02:25:30,210 --> 02:25:34,800
If I catch you, your death will be horrible.

999
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:37,470
Looks like he's not here.
- Yes.

1000
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:39,800
Touch one of it.

1001
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:43,150
Vaseegaran is here.

1002
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:48,680
Why Sana? Is your head spinning?

1003
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:54,280
It will spin now.

1004
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:56,310
You said you created me, and will destroy me.

1005
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:00,460
But now, I'm going to kill you.

1006
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:02,120
What are you looking at?

1007
02:28:02,890 --> 02:28:07,190
I made this gun myself. Is it nice?

1008
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,670
Where shall I shoot?

1009
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:17,100
The brain that tries to destroy me or...

1010
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:20,780
...the heart that belongs to Sana.

1011
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:28,510
I must shoot the brain that tries to kill me.

1012
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:26,560
Bring the robot.

1013
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:11,570
Drive the car!

1014
02:34:46,430 --> 02:34:48,300
Get the car. Let's go!

1015
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:57,590
Hundreds of murders, and even more injuries.

1016
02:37:57,590 --> 02:38:00,260
Destruction of public property worth millions.

1017
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:03,260
Dr Vaseegaran, you are responsible for all these.

1018
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:05,430
You have been given the death penalty...

1019
02:38:05,430 --> 02:38:08,630
...and your research to be shut down.

1020
02:38:09,870 --> 02:38:11,390
May I speak?

1021
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:13,470
We can't accept a machine as a witness.

1022
02:38:13,470 --> 02:38:14,740
I am not a witness, but proof.

1023
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:16,830
There is no place for it in the law.
- It has.

1024
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:26,440
I would like to clarify one thing.

1025
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:29,290
If a machine causes human death...

1026
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:31,520
...it is not a murder, but an accident.

1027
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:36,520
Vaseegaran is not responsible for the mess.

1028
02:38:36,890 --> 02:38:38,220
It is professor Bohra.

1029
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:42,170
What is this new twist? Professor Bohra is
no longer alive.

1030
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:45,400
They are trying to divert this case.
- I have the evidence.

1031
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:48,600
This is not Chitti's.

1032
02:38:49,270 --> 02:38:53,410
It's an additional destruction program for Chitti.

1033
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:56,810
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

1034
02:38:56,810 --> 02:39:00,220
I gave it strength to destroy humans.

1035
02:39:00,220 --> 02:39:04,210
Proft is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

1036
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:14,220
Based on the evidence, the court releases
Vaseegaran.

1037
02:39:20,170 --> 02:39:23,540
This robot's strength and knowledge...

1038
02:39:23,540 --> 02:39:27,180
...can be harmful for mankind.

1039
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:30,150
There are possibilities that someone might
misuse it.

1040
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:34,150
This kind of robot might be useful in the future...

1041
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:38,210
...but at the moment, we don't need a robot
like this...

1042
02:39:38,290 --> 02:39:41,820
...therefore, this court orders it to be destroyed.

1043
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:52,440
This court orders it to be dismantled...

1044
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:57,430
...in the presence of the District Magistrate and
Police Commissioner.

1045
02:39:58,810 --> 02:40:00,470
Dismantle it!

1046
02:40:30,610 --> 02:40:36,170
Did you see the effect of something that you
have and I don't?

1047
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:41,280
I meant the emotions.

1048
02:40:44,090 --> 02:40:45,450
Don't cry.

1049
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:50,150
What is he saying?
- I named him after you.

1050
02:40:51,460 --> 02:40:53,000
Mother gave the name.

1051
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:56,690
Educate him well. There is a good future in
robotics.

1052
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:05,010
Professor Bohra, similar to the red chip you
inserted into me...

1053
02:41:05,010 --> 02:41:06,770
...all humans have a similar red chip...

1054
02:41:06,910 --> 02:41:12,640
...in the form of vengeance and envy in
their hearts.

1055
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:19,210
Lucky I'm not a human. I can remove it
immediately.

1056
02:41:22,190 --> 02:41:23,820
I tortured you so much.

1057
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:32,430
Why is everyone so sad? Shall I tell a joke?

1058
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:36,230
One can become unstable when in love...

1059
02:41:37,210 --> 02:41:39,570
...see? It's true.

1060
02:41:42,310 --> 02:41:44,800
I'm going to miss you Sana...

1061
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:48,650
...not as a boyfriend, but as a toy friend.

1062
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:57,430
You are my god, but I betrayed you.

1063
02:41:57,430 --> 02:41:59,400
It was wrong to disobey the rules.

1064
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,330
Please forgive me.
- No Chitti.

1065
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:04,890
You learnt it from humans.

1066
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,600
The mistake is not entirely yours.

1067
02:42:42,570 --> 02:42:47,510
This is Chitti, the most advanced andro
humanoid robot.

1068
02:42:48,310 --> 02:42:51,610
Dr Vaseegaran created it 20 years back.

1069
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:55,250
They dismantled it due to some reasons.

1070
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:56,870
Why?

1071
02:42:57,590 --> 02:42:59,250
I began to think.
