1
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:53,792
Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works

2
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:02,459
Our friendship goes back years

3
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,542
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth

4
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,292
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna

5
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:12,209
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry

6
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,001
This one's for you, Ma

7
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:15,584
Thank you very much

8
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:19,334
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan

9
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,792
Aryan? The moron!

10
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,542
Anyone insults him

11
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:28,917
<i>I</i> fight

12
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,126
If I copy his style...

13
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,376
...l get whacked

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,959
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years

15
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,751
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star

16
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,084
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar

17
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,334
I never compare

18
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,334
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others

19
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:56,167
You're the greatest.
But I'm better

20
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,917
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him

21
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,042
That's real connection

22
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:08,126
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto

23
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,167
Tiny difference

24
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:11,917
He became a star

25
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,417
And I became his fan

26
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:19,959
And something else

27
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,001
We live together

28
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,001
In one cinema or the other

29
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:33,751
The real drama will start now!

30
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,292
None of my achievements
are my own

31
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,834
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today

32
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,292
It's all thanks to my fans

33
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:57,167
Without my fans, I'm nothing

34
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:00,084
Can't you even get 40% marks?

35
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,251
It's always Aryan, Aryan

36
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,167
My parents don't get it

37
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,376
He's not just a star,
he's my world

38
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,876
But God bowled a great googly

39
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,334
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...

40
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,001
...God made me with that

41
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,584
He and I are different.
Poles apart

42
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:31,876
But we are one

43
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,126
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan

44
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:06,334
I topped up your phone.
200 rupees

45
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,334
Send the money tomorrow

46
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:09,751
Don't worry

47
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,209
Tomorrow is fine

48
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,126
The shop is closing now

49
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,459
Check your phone

50
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,959
You're a gem. Bye, aunty

51
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,376
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter

52
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,626
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow

53
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,542
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro

54
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,417
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30

55
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,792
Go home, kids

56
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:35,876
Don't mess with me

57
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,751
All Well?

58
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,001
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing

59
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:49,959
So early?

60
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,251
- I have a show
- 5 minutes. Please

61
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,751
No. I'll be late

62
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,459
Only 5 minutes

63
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,292
It's urgent

64
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,792
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa

65
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,167
I have a costume trial

66
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,251
Can you do it later? OK then

67
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,501
Thanks

68
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,167
5 minutes

69
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,167
You don't let us stay and for her...

70
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,084
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges

71
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,917
I get what's urgent

72
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,501
Come back tomorrow

73
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,084
Get lost!

74
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,459
You losers

75
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,209
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you

76
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,751
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

77
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,001
- Two minutes to go
- All done

78
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,459
Thank you

79
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,251
How much?

80
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,542
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes

81
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,709
- Thanks
- Enjoy!

82
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,042
Brothers, the shop is closed

83
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,292
So the action just left?

84
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,334
What's 30 minutes?

85
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,667
I put this notice up a week ago

86
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,709
“Due to the grand Dussehra show

87
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,542
“Organized by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. Inder Vihar, DDA Colony

88
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,292
“AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp

89
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,917
“By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat”

90
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,417
See you again

91
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:38,626
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself

92
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,084
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister

93
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,417
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow

94
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:46,417
You photocopy!

95
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,251
Don't be cruel like Ravan

96
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,626
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset

97
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,292
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat

98
00:06:56,626 --> 00:07:00,459
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!

99
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:05,042
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now

100
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,126
Get smart, photocopy

101
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,042
The shop in Sector 28 is open

102
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,584
- Go there
- Don't you dare touch me!

103
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,084
- Don't touch
- Here, I'm touching

104
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,584
Get out of here

105
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,584
Let go! They need a lesson

106
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,626
Want to see porn? Huh...

107
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,834
What are you doing?

108
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:05,167
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble

109
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,751
I'm fine

110
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,459
You can all go. Thank you!

111
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,334
The jobless morons

112
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,542
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them

113
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:19,834
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

114
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,917
But I did call you

115
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,959
My heart did

116
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,792
So you came back

117
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,959
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan

118
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,792
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?

119
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:38,542
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you

120
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,959
Today's a birthday special

121
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,917
No, thank you

122
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,001
Welcome

123
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,167
How did you get hurt?

124
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,126
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association

125
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,751
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration

126
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:05,042
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

127
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,084
The prize is 20,000. Cash!

128
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:13,376
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan

129
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,084
My only chance to fulfill my dream

130
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,001
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams

131
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:23,251
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

132
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,209
Doesn't your 101-rupee donation
go up in smoke?

133
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,376
Hanumanji is a God.
And your Aryan...

134
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,751
He's important to me

135
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,501
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't

136
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,209
Spray some scent on me

137
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,459
- Careful
- If you can't do it, never mind

138
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,001
My fans are waiting. Get ready

139
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,542
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama

140
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,459
The real drama starts now

141
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,667
Hold on to your hearts

142
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,126
You're about to see a performance...

143
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,626
...that the Western Union,
moving money for better...

144
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,334
...Super Star competition
can never do without

145
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,167
You guessed right

146
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,376
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

147
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,917
Our Aryan Khanna Junior

148
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,542
Jindal aunty!

149
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,751
Your pressure cooker on the stove?

150
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,376
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here

151
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,417
My hattrick year

152
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,584
Today I'll share something personal

153
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,667
About me and Aryan

154
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,709
I hide nothing from you

155
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:14,251
I'm no ace at romancing

156
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,792
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire

157
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,292
Words escape me

158
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,751
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...

159
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,209
...to help his Junior

160
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:42,376
It's delicate. I must tread carefully

161
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,417
Don't forget

162
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,292
The heart's job is to beat

163
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:50,417
When you count the night stars...

164
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,792
...and yearn to etch my name
on every star

165
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,709
You know you're in love

166
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:00,084
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

167
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:04,417
When you look for me
in a crowd

168
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,501
You know you're in love

169
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,167
If you don't believe me

170
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,876
Then hold my hand

171
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,792
If your heart stops, then you know...

172
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,084
...you're in love

173
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,959
I don't have your style, Senior

174
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,209
But if anyone insults you...

175
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,042
...l want to break their teeth

176
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,042
Mummy says, “Calm down"

177
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,501
“Aryan is India's sweetheart”

178
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,917
But he's a Delhi boy after all

179
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:42,834
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle

180
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:25,501
Ma used to say: “Don't weigh
the food you're eating

181
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,709
“Don't count the guys you whack”

182
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,334
Here

183
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,584
Use this

184
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:49,001
I feel like just staring
at the screen

185
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,001
I have this dream

186
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,751
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines

187
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,334
I've been your fan forever

188
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,876
I think you owe me a dance

189
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,584
We'll have a blast

190
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,917
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

191
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,584
One last thing before I go

192
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,584
I am what I am today

193
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,584
I am where I am today

194
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,334
It's all thanks to my fans

195
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,167
Without my fans

196
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,209
I'm nothing

197
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,584
Brothers and sisters!

198
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:47,542
The Virat act did not impress us

199
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,292
The Katrina act did not impress

200
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,251
This year like every other year

201
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,417
The Western Union, moving money
for better...

202
00:15:56,626 --> 00:16:00,417
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

203
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,917
Gaurav Chandna

204
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,334
Give him a big hand!

205
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,084
I want to thank my Mummy

206
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,376
My Papa

207
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,501
My God

208
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:36,167
The greatest actor in the world

209
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,917
The Aryan Khanna

210
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,626
OK, go

211
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,251
But why travel without a ticket?

212
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,667
- Go later
- Later?

213
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:09,084
Aryan's birthday is in <i>2</i> days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?

214
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:12,417
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you

215
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,251
Remind her...

216
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,917
...how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time

217
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,584
- WT
- Without ticket!

218
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:23,334
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it

219
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,751
Papa, count the cash again

220
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,542
Phony fans cheer him from afar

221
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:33,501
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself

222
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,126
- Like this
- Have you gone mad?

223
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,001
Control the boy

224
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,209
Here. 20,000

225
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,292
ls your spit on the notes?

226
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,751
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag

227
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,459
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them

228
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,251
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me

229
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:54,542
Sohan halwa

230
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:58,501
Tell him your father got it
especially for him

231
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:01,917
- From Chandni Chowk
- Why tell him? I'll show him

232
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:06,167
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background

233
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:09,417
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy

234
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,459
Papa, hide those undies

235
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,376
- Cheese
- Cheese!

236
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,626
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop

237
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,584
- Can you manage?
- Sure

238
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,042
Don't overstay at Aryan's

239
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,459
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend

240
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,501
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy

241
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,167
Be careful, son

242
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:30,959
Where to?

243
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,084
Hi!

244
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,292
Your parents throw you out?

245
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,709
Keep dreaming about moving
to America

246
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,292
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face

247
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,001
Told Aryan you're coming?

248
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:47,126
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed

249
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,501
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan

250
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,209
Forget it, you won't understand

251
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:48,792
Hello, uncle

252
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:50,084
Hello, aunty

253
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,126
Your ice cream

254
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,417
One vegetarian meal

255
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,917
Seat number?

256
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:08,876
100

257
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,667
I'll get it

258
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,001
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me

259
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,417
It's only one night. We'll adjust

260
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:30,042
Allow me

261
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,876
Now it's OK

262
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:39,959
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry

263
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,042
We're coming

264
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:06,126
Without ticket?

265
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,084
Uncle, it's a long story

266
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,626
Let me explain

267
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,959
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station

268
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:19,167
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT traveling

269
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,876
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket

270
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:25,334
- I want to travel without one
- Come along

271
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,084
I'm not a thief or a criminal

272
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,959
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday

273
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,584
No point if I get there late

274
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:33,459
Aryan Khanna?

275
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,959
Right! He went to Mumbai WT

276
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,042
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205

277
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:40,792
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

278
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,917
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything

279
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,959
Here's the ticket money. Keep it

280
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:48,709
- But I'll travel WT
- Shut up!

281
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,251
You need a tight slap

282
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,709
Take him. He won't listen

283
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,334
Damn you!

284
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,084
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump

285
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,376
You'll be answering the cops
all night

286
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,417
Want to die? Get back inside

287
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,251
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...

288
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,042
...no point living

289
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:13,667
Don't lose your head over
these film stars

290
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,667
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me

291
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,542
Give me your hand or you'll die

292
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,334
- Take me to Mumbai
- OK! Give me your hand

293
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,001
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand

294
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,584
OK, hold me

295
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:39,126
ls he a relative? Do you
really know him?

296
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,459
Is he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?

297
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,334
A fan

298
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,417
Room 205 is occupied

299
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:16,042
Why? I've booked it

300
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,959
No bookings here

301
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,542
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key

302
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,667
I'll pay double

303
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,584
But only room 205

304
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,584
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do

305
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,126
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209

306
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:46,042
Here, brother. Room 205 for you

307
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,001
Happy birthday, Senior

308
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,959
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!

309
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,626
What a crowd! By God

310
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:14,751
Brother, move aside

311
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,917
The press over there

312
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,584
Let them come in

313
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,501
A selfie! Smile

314
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:35,709
Thank you

315
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,709
These two-faced fans

316
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,459
They moan about his films

317
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,459
And come here to pose with him

318
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,334
You can't go there

319
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:54,584
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans

320
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,834
I'm Gaurav Chandna

321
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:00,584
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express

322
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,001
Guess where I'm staying?

323
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,584
Guess!

324
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:11,167
Hotel Delite. Room number 205

325
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,042
Don't you get it?

326
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:15,667
I'll show you magic

327
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:17,667
You'll enjoy it. Look!

328
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,626
When you count the night stars...

329
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,376
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

330
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:30,417
You know you're in love

331
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,459
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

332
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,292
Lets go press

333
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,376
You know you're in love

334
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,042
When you turn back as you walk ahead

335
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,459
Check the press IDs

336
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,417
Go inside

337
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,292
Not you! Don't you get it?

338
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:50,251
I want to show him my trophy

339
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,376
I just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone

340
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,376
Moron!

341
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,876
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...

342
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:02,959
...he'll thrash you

343
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,667
It's OK. It's nothing

344
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,501
Mummy sent you special halwa

345
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:25,334
And this trophy...your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa

346
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:25,584
Yes, Mummy?

347
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:27,626
I'm fine

348
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:30,542
Aryan is fine, too

349
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,417
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy

350
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,084
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?

351
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,001
There are thousands of people
here to meet him

352
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:42,751
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him

353
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,792
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it

354
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:50,292
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear

355
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,376
I'm hanging up. I'll call later

356
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:12,251
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times

357
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,959
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now

358
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:18,876
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing

359
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,376
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy

360
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,376
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...

361
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,959
...through his gift to Sid Kapoor

362
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,542
No star has matched Aryan till now

363
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:33,709
But Sid Kapoor...

364
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,542
...has pulled the rug
from under his feet

365
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:40,917
The party guests said...

366
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,167
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...

367
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:46,042
...Aryan Khanna's days were over

368
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,709
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...

369
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:52,126
...that made him hit Sid Kapoor?

370
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,417
I went to wish him happy birthday

371
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:58,084
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order

372
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,292
He's an elder. I respect him a lot

373
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:06,001
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films

374
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,209
I don't know why I make him
insecure

375
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,917
What will you do?
Take legal action?

376
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,334
I should

377
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,709
I'll talk to my legal team

378
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,501
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something

379
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:24,126
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star

380
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,501
That's all I want to say

381
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:31,126
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team

382
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,001
Liar! Cheat

383
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:48,209
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you

384
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,501
You think he's insecure?

385
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,709
He's seen off dozens like you

386
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:57,167
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years

387
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,167
Do your worst, sonny!

388
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,459
No one can touch him

389
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,126
Just you wait

390
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:20,376
Cut it!

391
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,084
Great shot

392
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:31,459
Superb!

393
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,292
- Liked it?
- Fantastic

394
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:47,667
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole

395
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:53,167
What dialogue delivery!

396
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:59,626
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away

397
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,792
I am your biggest fan, sir

398
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,084
At the contest back home...

399
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,209
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you

400
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:09,459
I win, sir

401
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,209
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir

402
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,584
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...

403
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:18,584
- You let the girls through
- Let him come

404
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,292
<i>Sh" says yes</i>

405
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,501
Sorry. Give me space

406
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,459
I'll show you my act?

407
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:27,459
OK

408
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:38,501
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania

409
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,001
YOU can ape someone

410
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:44,001
But you can't ape his mind

411
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,584
When all doors are shut

412
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,334
There's a knock at mind's door

413
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:55,042
And when that door opens,
you see a new road

414
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:58,501
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania

415
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:05,042
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril

416
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,584
You're too good, fan

417
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:11,292
Well done, man

418
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:15,001
Relax man, calm down

419
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,542
I have the same jacket you're wearing

420
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,459
That's good. Very nice

421
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,542
- Sir's lunch break now
- One chance, sir

422
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:30,209
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour

423
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:32,917
And this fan, come on!

424
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,626
Hear that?

425
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:39,417
- Sit down
- No, thank you

426
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,917
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan

427
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,751
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

428
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,792
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

429
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,334
That's nothing, bro

430
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:55,876
I'll drag him to court

431
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:57,876
Allow me

432
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,626
Time's up for Aryan Khanna

433
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:05,334
- I'll wring your neck
- Santosh!

434
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,834
To hell with Santosh

435
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,667
Shut up! No one is coming

436
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,417
Close your mouth

437
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,626
Now listen... sit quietly...

438
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:25,542
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...

439
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,917
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper

440
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,334
No fan will look at you again

441
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:40,876
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera

442
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,501
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines

443
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,626
Do your rubbish acting

444
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,959
Your damn phone never
stops ringing

445
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,042
Now I'll see

446
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,292
Read it!

447
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:06,751
Sta rt

448
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,292
It's in Hindi, dude

449
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,667
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

450
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:21,292
Where do they find you guys?

451
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,417
What do you film people say?

452
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,626
Action!

453
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,001
Dear Aryan sir

454
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,334
I'm really very sorry

455
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:34,084
My statement to the press
was all lies

456
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:36,126
I wanted to spoil your name

457
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,209
No one can take your place.
You're the best

458
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:43,917
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star

459
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:47,084
I apologise again

460
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,792
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me

461
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,126
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

462
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,084
Dad, he bullies me

463
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,626
He bullies you because
he's scared of you

464
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,334
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!

465
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,751
- Dhruv, let's play
- Dad, come on

466
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,501
Play with lsha. I've trained her

467
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,709
- I am so sorry
- Dad, you made me lose a point

468
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,792
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her

469
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:23,292
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new

470
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:25,417
Glad it got sorted

471
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:30,209
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point

472
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,626
Nothing is sorted, it's a game

473
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,959
Apology, say sorry - it's all a game

474
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:41,251
You should've controlled yourself

475
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:42,751
I tried very hard

476
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:45,001
I gave him one slap. More a pat

477
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:48,667
See the scandal it's created

478
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:52,167
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine

479
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,417
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?

480
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,959
You have no time

481
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,251
Let someone else flirt with me

482
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:02,834
Actually you're right

483
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,501
But not this moron

484
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:11,292
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz

485
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:15,417
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break

486
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:39,792
Aryan, wake up!

487
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:41,917
What happened?

488
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:43,792
Did you sleep here all night?

489
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:47,876
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off

490
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,251
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with

491
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,584
Good morning, Aryan

492
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:54,959
It's too early, Sunaina

493
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,084
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something

494
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,251
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan

495
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:02,709
See this

496
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:06,084
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry

497
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:07,917
Dear Aryan sir

498
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,042
Look here. Look at the camera

499
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,667
OK. I'll do it

500
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:17,709
- Come on
- Did Aryan send you?

501
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,459
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera

502
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:25,459
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go

503
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,917
Cash? I'll give you cash

504
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,001
Stop! I'll do it

505
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,792
What will you do? Scum!

506
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:54,084
A fan

507
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,042
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna

508
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,126
He sent a message

509
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,834
“A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna

510
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,501
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set”

511
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:18,542
Hello

512
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,417
Junior Aryan Khanna?

513
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:25,751
You calling from Aryan's house?

514
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,292
Yes

515
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:32,501
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?

516
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,542
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you

517
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,209
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

518
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:42,126
I did so much for him

519
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:44,959
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...

520
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,626
Yeah, yeah, hello

521
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,126
Aryan...

522
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,251
Aryan Khanna?

523
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,876
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior

524
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,001
Where are you?

525
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,834
Just guess

526
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,584
Delite hotel, in your room

527
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:14,751
<i>Room no. 205. Charm Road.
Remember?</i>

528
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:19,417
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do

529
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:22,042
I deserve a hug from my brother

530
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:25,584
- You want to see me?
- Sure

531
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,959
I made a big scandal just to meet you

532
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:32,292
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up

533
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,626
Done, Senior

534
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,751
Thank you!

535
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:46,167
Mind blasting

536
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:48,626
Really?

537
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,126
Go by taxi

538
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:55,126
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw

539
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,042
He's sending me his personal car

540
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,834
He's invited me home

541
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,209
Don't forget to take pictures

542
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:06,542
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper

543
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:11,084
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him

544
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:15,667
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali

545
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:20,126
- Make sure he takes the trophy
- As though he wouldn't

546
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,167
- Say hello from me
- And me, too

547
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,209
OK. I'll tell him

548
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,876
Phone me once you've met him

549
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,751
The car's here. Call you later

550
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:34,459
The car is there

551
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:40,334
Hello

552
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:48,167
Are you the driver?

553
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:50,417
Junior Aryan Khanna?

554
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,959
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No

555
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:57,001
You're mistaken

556
00:42:58,501 --> 00:42:59,751
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

557
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:01,917
I'll tell you later. Come

558
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:05,251
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere

559
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:08,501
- Like hell you won't
- I won't come

560
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,042
Don't touch me

561
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:14,667
No touching

562
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,334
Let me go!

563
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:39,209
Stop!

564
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:01,959
Try catching me!

565
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:07,501
- Stop! You rascal
- Please don't hit me

566
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,417
Don't hit hard. We have orders

567
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:22,751
Let's go

568
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:26,167
Let me call Aryan Khanna

569
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:27,959
Where are you taking me?

570
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,751
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him

571
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,042
Shut up!

572
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:41,834
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem

573
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:48,751
If Aryan hears about this...

574
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,792
...he'll skin you alive

575
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,292
Stop!

576
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:58,917
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go

577
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,334
Good evening, sir. Come in

578
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,959
We asked him why he made the video

579
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,626
He says he'll talk only to you

580
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:51,917
You told us to go easy on him

581
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,542
- Hardly touched him
- Thank you

582
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,001
- Usman
- Yes, sir?

583
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,709
This is for his expenses

584
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:02,501
Keep him here for <i>2</i> days

585
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:04,959
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station

586
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,001
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly

587
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:09,834
Just enough to scare him

588
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,292
No one must hear about this

589
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:16,876
No police record, no video statement.
Please

590
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:18,376
Sure, sir

591
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:20,459
Where is he?

592
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:23,876
I want to meet him alone

593
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:26,834
- You stay here
- Yeah

594
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:40,917
Gaurav

595
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:04,251
Senior

596
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,792
You're here

597
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,251
I knew you'd come

598
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,542
They hit me and hit me

599
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,042
They broke my bones

600
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,001
I protected my face

601
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,542
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it

602
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,292
See? Same to same

603
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:38,334
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...

604
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,001
...there's only one Aryan Khanna

605
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:43,751
Relax

606
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:46,751
It's OK

607
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,501
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition

608
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,292
Always win first prize

609
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:04,126
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it

610
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:06,167
I brought it to show you

611
00:50:10,626 --> 00:50:12,209
I could show you my act

612
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:25,751
I'm nervous in front of you

613
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,334
It's all right. Sit

614
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:33,084
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps

615
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,167
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi

616
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:37,334
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from lnder Vihar

617
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,792
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park

618
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,834
Listen carefully

619
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:45,376
You did something nasty

620
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,001
It's a crime

621
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:52,959
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

622
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,751
Not love, it's stupidity

623
00:50:58,334 --> 00:50:59,709
Do you have family?

624
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:02,167
There's Papa, Mummy

625
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,209
And you, too

626
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,417
Have you thought what
your parents would say?

627
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:09,334
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video

628
00:51:09,751 --> 00:51:12,834
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you

629
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,917
Did you like my birthday gift?

630
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,584
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him

631
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:25,167
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret

632
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,542
Our?

633
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,209
There is no “our” between
you and me

634
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,167
The police brought you here
on my orders

635
00:51:37,334 --> 00:51:39,334
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished

636
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,917
So you won't mess up again

637
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:48,792
On your orders? I did so much for you

638
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,501
Who are you to do anything
for me?

639
00:51:57,876 --> 00:51:59,001
I'm your fan

640
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,292
- You're my star
- Fan? So you do as you please?

641
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:06,626
Thrash people? Murder?

642
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:11,417
If need be, I could murder for you

643
00:52:15,376 --> 00:52:16,751
You're not my fan

644
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:20,126
Don't say that

645
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,917
I risked my life to meet you

646
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:27,001
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...

647
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:28,792
...in return?

648
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:33,251
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all

649
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:38,792
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life

650
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:42,667
Why must I give you even
five seconds?

651
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:11,709
I am who I am today,
where I am today

652
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:14,501
My stardom

653
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,959
It's all thanks to my fans

654
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,751
If it weren't for my fans...

655
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,209
I'd be nothing

656
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:42,584
Gaurav makes Aryan

657
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:45,917
Without Gaurav...

658
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:48,501
...Aryan is nothing

659
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:53,917
Now you listen carefully

660
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:57,876
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?

661
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:00,042
I'll forget all about Gaurav

662
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,876
And you forget you ever met Aryan

663
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,501
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine

664
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:12,251
This is your final warning. OK

665
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:27,167
Forget it

666
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:29,376
You won't understand

667
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,042
Yes, Mummy

668
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:45,542
I'll be home soon

669
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,251
Everything OK?

670
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,334
Everything is fine

671
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:48,709
Why didn't you take my call?

672
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:50,126
I was busy

673
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,792
Gaurav, we're worried about you

674
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:52,751
Don't worry

675
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:54,417
You'll come home soon?

676
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,417
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe

677
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:57,626
Are you eating properly?

678
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,584
The food is fine here

679
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:03,876
Thank you

680
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:05,876
Come, hero. Sir wants you

681
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:13,917
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

682
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,126
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry

683
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:49,376
Gaurav!

684
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,334
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

685
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,626
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?

686
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,709
Don't you feel bad

687
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:15,792
It's not my loss. It's his

688
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,751
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am

689
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,167
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight

690
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,584
Hello, aunty

691
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:58,501
You're moving out?

692
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:01,251
Who knows what this boy wants

693
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:03,251
Got a good price?

694
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,376
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely

695
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,084
Too much time wasted on Aryan

696
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,959
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go

697
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,001
Hurry. You coming?

698
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,709
- Let's go
- OK, come

699
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:17,834
All well, aunty?

700
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,126
Fans chase stars

701
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:59,667
Now a star will chase a fan

702
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:04,459
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...

703
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:08,792
...it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna

704
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:37,292
1 Year later

705
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,667
Welcome to Bollywood Café.
98.1 FM

706
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,751
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

707
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:44,209
Guys, this weekend...

708
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:47,042
...is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai

709
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:50,126
Stars have a great life

710
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:52,542
I want a life like Aryan's

711
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:53,876
Full on, jet setter!

712
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:56,251
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next

713
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,209
For the grand Bhutiani wedding

714
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,042
Then back to the London show

715
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:01,001
Wow!

716
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:04,334
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?

717
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:07,251
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai

718
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:12,251
We have some good news
and some bad news

719
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:13,834
The bad news first, obviously

720
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:16,792
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful

721
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:18,959
Oh no! What's the good news?

722
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:22,126
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners

723
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,251
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...

724
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:28,542
...wins a free show ticket

725
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:32,959
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song

726
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:46,459
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit

727
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,709
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please

728
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:54,584
Enjoy your visit

729
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:46,626
The real drama starts now

730
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:51,751
Aryan Khanna!

731
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:06,167
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager

732
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,042
Aryan Khanna, the actor

733
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:11,292
I hope it's not a bother

734
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:13,459
Fans never bother

735
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,751
Sir, a photo with your wax figure

736
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:24,834
Let me say this. It's amazing

737
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,251
You've come all the way to London...

738
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,334
...to take a photo with
my wax figure

739
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:33,042
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?

740
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:35,626
Better now?

741
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:39,209
Let me warn you

742
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,959
I was much younger then

743
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:43,251
You like it?

744
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:44,376
Honestly...

745
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:46,042
...it's very scary

746
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,501
So, does he look like me?

747
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:52,376
- You look great in real life
- Exactly, darling

748
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:55,876
I agree. What a fat nose he has

749
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,459
My nose is tiny

750
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:01,334
A phony face

751
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:02,917
A fake smile

752
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:04,501
All phony

753
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:06,959
I don't smile like this

754
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,584
Actually no one smiles like this

755
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,209
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad

756
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:21,001
In fact, I don't look like him at all

757
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,334
This is a fake

758
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:26,209
Aryan Khanna is a fake

759
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:30,334
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake

760
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,084
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property

761
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:38,334
The white man claims
my face is his property

762
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,709
Mr. Property Agent. This is me

763
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:43,834
My face, my property

764
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:47,084
- Stop now and leave, sir
- I won't leave

765
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,292
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke

766
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:00,709
Come here. Come

767
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,334
Who can stop me?

768
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,709
I'll shoot you all

769
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:08,084
I don't understand what
you're talking about

770
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:09,709
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this

771
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:10,459
Really?

772
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:15,126
You are in trouble too

773
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:18,709
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot

774
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,667
You alright?

775
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:16,917
Aryan...

776
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:21,001
What?

777
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,042
Come out

778
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:23,376
What are you saying?

779
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,376
Arrest warrant for you

780
01:07:31,584 --> 01:07:32,751
What the hell is this?

781
01:07:33,084 --> 01:07:34,959
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds

782
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:38,751
- The Indian Ambassador on line
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador

783
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,376
I'm here to arrest him

784
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:42,792
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...

785
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:44,834
Are you Mr. Khanna?

786
01:07:45,209 --> 01:07:47,084
Then just shut up and let me
do my job

787
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:50,417
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?

788
01:07:51,042 --> 01:07:54,084
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan

789
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:55,376
Guess what?

790
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:57,584
It's my turn to be polite now

791
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:00,126
This, sir, is nonsense

792
01:08:02,209 --> 01:08:04,792
Where were you between
10 and 10.30 this morning?

793
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:06,501
- I was at home
- And who were you with?

794
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:08,334
I was alone

795
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,584
Did anyone see you at home?

796
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:12,959
I just told you I was alone

797
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:14,542
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer

798
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:18,001
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

799
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:20,751
Let me translate it in a language
you understand

800
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:22,459
Lawyer

801
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:24,334
Two options

802
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:28,126
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice

803
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,001
Nasty

804
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:13,709
Just five minutes

805
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:15,042
You stay here

806
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,626
Just five minutes sir, please

807
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:19,542
Let's call Akhtar

808
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:41,167
What happened?

809
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:43,334
Lost your funny bone?

810
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:46,251
That's not me

811
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:48,876
Behaves like you

812
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:51,542
Looks like you

813
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:55,417
Everybody calls this person
by your name

814
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:00,251
I said that's not me

815
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:02,251
You have any proof?

816
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,709
Say something, Mr. Superstar

817
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,834
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop

818
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,084
Not a word without my lawyer

819
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:16,001
Suit yourself

820
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:19,292
24 hrs remand for Mr. Khanna

821
01:10:19,626 --> 01:10:21,376
Till he comes out with the truth

822
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,459
- You can't do that
- Sure, I can

823
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:34,667
Sir, one photograph please?

824
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:43,751
- You have a safe trip, sir
- Yeah, I will be

825
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,417
It's time. Lets go

826
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:08,542
DUBROVNIK

827
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:17,667
In Croatian, we say - How are you?

828
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:20,792
I'm fine

829
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:22,917
My name is Gaurav

830
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:29,292
Thank you

831
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,001
Vegetable sandwich... one

832
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,584
Which one do you want?

833
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:39,751
This one?

834
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:41,501
OK. Here we go

835
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:48,042
No, no, more. Six more

836
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,792
It's OK. Here

837
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:55,209
Thank you

838
01:12:58,251 --> 01:12:59,126
Thanks

839
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:30,751
It's only bail

840
01:13:32,084 --> 01:13:33,459
We know you're lying

841
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:35,709
Why would I waste my lies on you?

842
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,626
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho

843
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:41,584
We'll have you back
in jail in no time

844
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,167
Please do that

845
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:46,001
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police

846
01:13:46,376 --> 01:13:49,084
Aryan, control your temper

847
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:51,667
It's their city, their country

848
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:55,501
Don't make matters worse
for yourself

849
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:58,292
So we're done with all
the formalities?

850
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,167
Thanks a lot

851
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:02,709
Pathetic fool

852
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:07,167
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem

853
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,209
Hey! Not that way

854
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:11,584
The press is outside

855
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,792
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy

856
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,751
Pleased to meet you

857
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,917
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...

858
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:22,876
We can't interfere very much

859
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,667
This is a foreign country after all

860
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:27,834
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent

861
01:14:28,584 --> 01:14:30,959
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives

862
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:34,834
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel

863
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:36,751
Now we can only do that much

864
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,417
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue

865
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:43,042
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds

866
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:46,417
Must I prove it? OK, I'll play cop

867
01:14:47,084 --> 01:14:49,334
I really appreciate your help

868
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:50,709
Thank you

869
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:52,792
Thank you, sir

870
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:57,501
In jail or dancing at a wedding...

871
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,751
...these stars are so arrogant

872
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:05,584
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police

873
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:09,834
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home

874
01:15:10,584 --> 01:15:13,001
Who is he? What's his motive

875
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:14,542
Forget the London cops

876
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:16,667
Find out. We need to get this guy

877
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:19,876
We'll know more back in London

878
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,042
So you know you can
really relax now

879
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:23,792
Wine? Champagne? Anything?

880
01:15:24,584 --> 01:15:25,126
Everything

881
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:26,959
Come on, Aryan. It's over now

882
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:29,084
Sir, a call

883
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:32,459
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds

884
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:35,876
- Give me the phone. I'll talk
- He'll only talk to sir

885
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:37,417
He won't give me his name

886
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:39,626
Give it to me

887
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:46,209
Hello

888
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:54,834
Senior

889
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:01,292
Chandna?

890
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:04,334
I won't let you forget my name

891
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:06,792
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name

892
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:08,584
What do you want?

893
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:10,126
The stage is set

894
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:13,751
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong

895
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:17,417
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry

896
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:20,417
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologizing to anyone

897
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:23,417
I tried to make you see sense

898
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,334
If you had agreed to give me
5 minutes

899
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:28,792
I would have my life.
You would have yours

900
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,709
But you had to prove you had
star power

901
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,292
Now you'll see a fan's power

902
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:34,459
I'm a star

903
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:38,167
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days

904
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:41,542
If I knew the real you,
you'd still be inside

905
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:45,126
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years

906
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:47,876
If you don't say sorry...

907
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:50,459
...in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over

908
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:52,542
Do what you want

909
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:55,709
I've seen off dozens like you

910
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:59,376
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall

911
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:04,251
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna

912
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:06,209
Impossible for you

913
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:11,584
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me

914
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:14,334
I don't need to go far

915
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:17,834
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik

916
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,167
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik

917
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:30,709
Unknown caller, unknown location

918
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:34,834
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number

919
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,459
Say sorry. It's no big deal

920
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:44,584
He's mad

921
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:47,417
ls that so? And what am I?

922
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,209
Is the make-up team in place?

923
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,001
They are on there way

924
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:58,334
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that

925
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:00,751
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect

926
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,167
OK. Thank you

927
01:18:03,251 --> 01:18:05,376
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members

928
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:07,209
- ls it done yet?
- It's going on right now

929
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:08,417
OK. Thank you

930
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:13,709
Nicksi Jelopera

931
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:28,751
- Medium?
- Medium size

932
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:17,251
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done

933
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:19,876
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani

934
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:21,626
I had a crisis, I'm sorry

935
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:24,751
You celebrities always have
some crisis

936
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:27,167
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday

937
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:29,334
- I know. I'm sorry
- You've no idea

938
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:33,501
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face

939
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:34,917
No, Mr. Bhutiani

940
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:37,376
What happened at Madame Tussauds...

941
01:19:38,584 --> 01:19:40,542
You know what? I'll make
it up to you

942
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:44,334
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding

943
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:45,834
They better do

944
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:47,959
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you

945
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:53,542
Only you can. I'll get ready

946
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,626
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are

947
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:01,251
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors

948
01:20:01,584 --> 01:20:03,751
- Keep an eye on everyone
- Excuse me, sir

949
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:06,376
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes

950
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:09,334
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready

951
01:20:10,126 --> 01:20:11,167
Good luck

952
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:13,001
Payal, tell me the names

953
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:15,417
ls Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?

954
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:16,876
It's Anmol Mirchandani

955
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:19,042
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well

956
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:21,167
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

957
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:23,751
That's for later, it's all here

958
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:26,917
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me

959
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:28,751
- Sir, your shades
- Thank you, Payal

960
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:30,876
OK guys. You have 30 seconds
to go

961
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,667
All the best, just kill it

962
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:19,417
Check all entries and exits

963
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:20,959
OK, Sunaina

964
01:21:33,626 --> 01:21:34,584
Find anything?

965
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:38,542
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite

966
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,292
Sir, your cue cards

967
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:41,876
15 secs to go

968
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:44,042
Can you go to cam 4

969
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:50,584
When you count the night stars...

970
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:52,959
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

971
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:54,959
You know you're in love

972
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,459
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

973
01:21:57,834 --> 01:22:01,751
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love

974
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:06,251
“Say

975
01:22:09,209 --> 01:22:10,667
Check the crew's photos

976
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:13,584
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick

977
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:14,542
Got it

978
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:19,542
Sorry

979
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:33,584
There. Zoom in

980
01:22:34,751 --> 01:22:37,126
Check the crew backstage

981
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:38,209
COPY

982
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:41,834
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas

983
01:22:42,251 --> 01:22:44,959
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know

984
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,167
Sorry

985
01:22:59,334 --> 01:22:59,959
It's fine

986
01:23:03,334 --> 01:23:05,084
The crew is local

987
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:08,251
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

988
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:12,834
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him

989
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:14,542
Keep a close eye

990
01:23:20,001 --> 01:23:20,917
Round up all the crew

991
01:23:51,084 --> 01:23:53,084
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing

992
01:23:53,376 --> 01:23:54,834
He's not responding

993
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:55,876
Sunaina

994
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,667
Can't see him on any camera

995
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:59,667
- But I'm at it
- What are you at it?

996
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,084
Where is there no CCTV camera?

997
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:10,209
Your make-up room

998
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:20,126
Careful, sir

999
01:24:38,834 --> 01:24:41,209
“Gaurav makes Aryan"

1000
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:54,917
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me

1001
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:58,542
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face

1002
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:01,251
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna

1003
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:04,251
But you never see me

1004
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:08,751
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me

1005
01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:12,334
I know the feeling

1006
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:15,084
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house

1007
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:24,542
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...

1008
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,001
Yeah. I'm coming

1009
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:30,751
- I'll take care of it
- Thank you

1010
01:25:33,334 --> 01:25:35,417
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart

1011
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:37,126
Hope you enjoyed the show

1012
01:25:37,459 --> 01:25:39,459
- Aryan, it was marvelous
- Thank you

1013
01:25:39,959 --> 01:25:41,001
That's my daughter

1014
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:44,542
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months

1015
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:46,667
Actually we were both practicing

1016
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:48,251
How pretty is she

1017
01:25:48,459 --> 01:25:50,417
You know what? Let me start
with the young one

1018
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:52,167
...and I'll come back
for the experience

1019
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,834
We've found Chandna

1020
01:26:18,126 --> 01:26:21,251
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing

1021
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:23,126
I'm not dancing

1022
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:25,376
Chandna is on the dance floor

1023
01:27:15,376 --> 01:27:17,042
What the hell is wrong with him?

1024
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:21,126
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere

1025
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:23,251
I don't know. You'll have
to do something

1026
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:25,417
- Get him out
- I don't care

1027
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,001
What the hell are you doing?

1028
01:27:38,251 --> 01:27:39,042
Mr. Bhutiani?

1029
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,417
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani

1030
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:43,792
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter

1031
01:27:45,459 --> 01:27:47,334
ls this how you film stars behave?

1032
01:27:47,501 --> 01:27:49,751
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry

1033
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:52,917
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me

1034
01:27:53,417 --> 01:27:55,126
- Nonsense
- It was somebody else

1035
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:56,584
I'm Aryan Khanna

1036
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:58,751
- I'm Aryan Khanna
- What nonsense!

1037
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:00,459
You known me for years

1038
01:28:00,626 --> 01:28:03,376
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people

1039
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,542
That person wasn't me

1040
01:28:07,126 --> 01:28:08,876
I suggest you leave

1041
01:28:22,626 --> 01:28:23,917
Keep back!

1042
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:35,459
Stop the car!

1043
01:33:56,876 --> 01:33:59,251
No one has given me the
interaction script

1044
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:03,501
15 minutes to show time.
ls there a delay?

1045
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:08,917
What?

1046
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:17,251
The show's canceled

1047
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:22,417
They've boycotted the show

1048
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:26,459
Sponsors have also pulled out

1049
01:34:28,959 --> 01:34:31,542
Nobody came, not a soul

1050
01:35:42,876 --> 01:35:43,876
Whats wrong with you?

1051
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:44,667
You wimp

1052
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:46,001
Watch where you're going?

1053
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:00,876
Media playing up the story

1054
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:02,792
The wedding video has gone viral

1055
01:36:19,667 --> 01:36:23,376
“Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions

1056
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:25,167
“ls he attention-seeking?

1057
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:27,834
“Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens

1058
01:36:28,001 --> 01:36:30,834
“Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done

1059
01:36:31,126 --> 01:36:33,126
“lt's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...

1060
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:36,084
“...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...

1061
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:38,917
“...for stars? A criminal is
a criminal”

1062
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:49,084
Hello

1063
01:36:49,667 --> 01:36:52,209
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I’m calling from London

1064
01:36:52,876 --> 01:36:55,459
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1065
01:36:57,126 --> 01:37:00,042
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes

1066
01:37:00,459 --> 01:37:01,709
We have to arrest him

1067
01:37:01,959 --> 01:37:05,084
But the crimes are committed
outside of India

1068
01:37:05,667 --> 01:37:08,542
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction

1069
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:11,292
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1070
01:37:12,334 --> 01:37:13,792
His name is Gaurav Chandna

1071
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:16,542
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help

1072
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:19,084
You don't teach me my job

1073
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,959
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan

1074
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,417
I just...

1075
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:27,459
Come back to India

1076
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:31,126
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?

1077
01:37:33,792 --> 01:37:34,584
Hello

1078
01:37:38,126 --> 01:37:39,209
What did he say?

1079
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:44,209
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow

1080
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:47,334
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London

1081
01:37:50,834 --> 01:37:56,334
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc

1082
01:37:57,126 --> 01:37:58,834
You have proof...

1083
01:37:59,376 --> 01:38:03,251
...that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes

1084
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:16,292
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be

1085
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:18,542
But believe me

1086
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:22,084
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me

1087
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:24,167
That person is not me

1088
01:38:24,376 --> 01:38:25,459
So please give me time

1089
01:38:25,626 --> 01:38:29,334
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong

1090
01:38:31,126 --> 01:38:34,084
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...

1091
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:35,917
...to call me your star

1092
01:38:36,626 --> 01:38:38,001
Whatever I am...

1093
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:46,084
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this

1094
01:38:47,084 --> 01:38:47,959
Thank you

1095
01:38:50,126 --> 01:38:54,126
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1096
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:58,417
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial

1097
01:38:58,626 --> 01:39:00,001
What about the imposter's name?

1098
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:03,167
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know

1099
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:06,501
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1100
01:39:10,459 --> 01:39:12,501
You find this funny? A big joke?

1101
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:17,959
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?

1102
01:39:19,792 --> 01:39:23,167
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?

1103
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,792
And one more thing

1104
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:29,709
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence

1105
01:39:30,501 --> 01:39:32,334
I want to warn you all

1106
01:39:33,459 --> 01:39:36,501
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name

1107
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:39,626
He can hurt anyone, anytime

1108
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:41,542
So please be careful

1109
01:39:43,626 --> 01:39:45,126
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming

1110
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:47,792
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India

1111
01:39:48,001 --> 01:39:49,584
So have a great day and
see you soon

1112
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,417
MUMBAI

1113
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:06,834
Don't stop, go from behind

1114
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:17,959
Open up!

1115
01:40:20,084 --> 01:40:22,959
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her

1116
01:40:23,376 --> 01:40:24,751
Good. Hurry up

1117
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:26,876
Before the journalists outside mob me

1118
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:33,001
Hello

1119
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:35,042
Ma'am, can sir come in?

1120
01:40:38,459 --> 01:40:39,667
No, wait a second

1121
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:44,667
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir

1122
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:47,251
Ask him to face the camera

1123
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,876
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward

1124
01:40:56,834 --> 01:41:00,376
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes

1125
01:41:00,751 --> 01:41:01,917
A big nose

1126
01:41:02,084 --> 01:41:03,792
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi

1127
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:06,709
Hans Raj College, Delhi University

1128
01:41:08,251 --> 01:41:09,959
Give me the phone, quick!

1129
01:41:11,834 --> 01:41:13,501
The press will surround me

1130
01:41:14,834 --> 01:41:17,334
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms

1131
01:41:17,584 --> 01:41:18,959
Why is your phone off?

1132
01:41:20,209 --> 01:41:22,001
Can I tell you inside?

1133
01:41:24,876 --> 01:41:25,917
Open the door

1134
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:38,084
Guys. Dad's here

1135
01:42:04,667 --> 01:42:06,334
Aryan, you're back?

1136
01:42:18,751 --> 01:42:20,167
- Hi
- Hi

1137
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:23,251
- You're back
- Yes, I'm back

1138
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,917
Are the kids asleep?

1139
01:42:32,251 --> 01:42:34,667
Yes. It's way past their bedtime

1140
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:36,751
Of course

1141
01:42:37,376 --> 01:42:39,001
Let them sleep

1142
01:42:40,376 --> 01:42:44,167
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room

1143
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:49,501
Yes

1144
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:59,917
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours

1145
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:02,626
I spent my life preparing
for this moment

1146
01:43:03,126 --> 01:43:05,667
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you

1147
01:43:05,959 --> 01:43:07,334
Of course

1148
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:26,042
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again

1149
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:34,167
It's better for us both if lsha
stays asleep

1150
01:43:41,042 --> 01:43:42,334
I did say...

1151
01:43:43,542 --> 01:43:45,709
...we could talk calmly

1152
01:43:47,876 --> 01:43:49,126
Why do you need that?

1153
01:43:49,751 --> 01:43:50,709
Give

1154
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:55,084
I have nothing against you
or your children

1155
01:43:56,751 --> 01:43:57,792
Give me that

1156
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,459
Senior ignores me

1157
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:05,542
You can't let him do that

1158
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:11,667
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it

1159
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:16,376
Sound asleep

1160
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:18,876
Come, come

1161
01:44:27,251 --> 01:44:29,917
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time

1162
01:44:30,626 --> 01:44:32,167
Come on, sit down

1163
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:39,251
This room has so many stories

1164
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:43,876
Many stories behind these awards

1165
01:44:45,167 --> 01:44:46,667
In these costumes

1166
01:44:48,501 --> 01:44:50,876
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget

1167
01:44:51,751 --> 01:44:55,292
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart

1168
01:45:01,459 --> 01:45:03,876
I treasured his memories too

1169
01:45:04,876 --> 01:45:07,667
Kept them right here

1170
01:45:10,501 --> 01:45:14,584
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards

1171
01:45:15,334 --> 01:45:16,917
On shelves like these

1172
01:45:26,292 --> 01:45:29,709
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life

1173
01:45:31,376 --> 01:45:32,959
But he ended it all

1174
01:45:33,334 --> 01:45:36,917
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes

1175
01:45:37,334 --> 01:45:39,917
Know what he said?
“lt's my life

1176
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,292
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?”

1177
01:45:47,209 --> 01:45:50,126
- I apologise on his behalf
- Why should you apologise?

1178
01:45:51,584 --> 01:45:53,626
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake

1179
01:45:54,584 --> 01:45:56,084
He was hassling Aryan

1180
01:45:57,001 --> 01:45:59,667
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten

1181
01:46:01,084 --> 01:46:05,584
Said: “lt's a crime!” A crime?

1182
01:46:07,501 --> 01:46:09,042
Crime is what I'll do now

1183
01:46:11,251 --> 01:46:15,001
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1184
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:17,334
...is a crime too

1185
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:22,459
You tell me

1186
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:25,376
Am I so wrong?

1187
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:30,251
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1188
01:46:32,834 --> 01:46:35,709
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!

1189
01:46:36,042 --> 01:46:38,209
Don't do this. I beg you

1190
01:46:38,417 --> 01:46:40,251
What do you mean “please”?

1191
01:46:41,459 --> 01:46:43,834
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?

1192
01:46:44,167 --> 01:46:46,126
How can I? Impossible

1193
01:46:47,376 --> 01:46:49,084
A sham. All lies

1194
01:46:50,167 --> 01:46:52,709
Liar. He's a fake

1195
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:55,876
The rascal acts all the time

1196
01:46:57,251 --> 01:46:58,709
An actor after all

1197
01:47:07,459 --> 01:47:09,417
I wanted to give him my trophy

1198
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:17,042
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna

1199
01:47:38,751 --> 01:47:39,917
Open the door!

1200
01:47:57,626 --> 01:47:59,917
I sent the children to my parents

1201
01:48:01,084 --> 01:48:04,626
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them

1202
01:48:05,834 --> 01:48:08,792
lsha asked me repeatedly: “Why did
Papa destroy the study?

1203
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:11,251
Don't worry. It's OK

1204
01:48:11,459 --> 01:48:14,876
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing

1205
01:48:15,709 --> 01:48:18,042
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal

1206
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:21,959
I came this far in life
on my own steam

1207
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:25,167
I'll handle it myself

1208
01:48:28,584 --> 01:48:30,709
Play rough like a street hoodlum

1209
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:33,751
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs

1210
01:48:35,959 --> 01:48:38,584
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face

1211
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:41,959
Now he'll see my real face

1212
01:48:43,542 --> 01:48:44,792
I'm a Delhi man too

1213
01:48:46,834 --> 01:48:50,084
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me

1214
01:48:50,876 --> 01:48:52,542
That person is not me.
Give me time

1215
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:55,001
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong

1216
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:58,792
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star

1217
01:48:59,126 --> 01:49:02,501
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent

1218
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:06,417
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes

1219
01:49:06,709 --> 01:49:10,209
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?

1220
01:49:10,459 --> 01:49:13,917
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions

1221
01:49:15,626 --> 01:49:20,334
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...

1222
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:23,542
...this criminal will not escape them

1223
01:49:23,959 --> 01:49:26,417
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished

1224
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:51,876
Hello, Gauru

1225
01:49:52,959 --> 01:49:53,751
Mummy

1226
01:49:54,376 --> 01:49:57,126
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?

1227
01:49:57,584 --> 01:49:58,376
Right here

1228
01:49:59,084 --> 01:50:00,001
I'm OK

1229
01:50:01,709 --> 01:50:02,667
And you?

1230
01:50:02,876 --> 01:50:06,126
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble

1231
01:50:09,042 --> 01:50:12,751
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home

1232
01:50:16,917 --> 01:50:17,626
Aryan?

1233
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:20,792
You barged into my home?

1234
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:24,751
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?

1235
01:50:26,709 --> 01:50:29,292
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat

1236
01:50:29,459 --> 01:50:31,667
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you

1237
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:35,667
- But I am not a lowlife like you
- Don't drag my parents into this

1238
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:37,667
They did nothing

1239
01:50:38,584 --> 01:50:39,584
What did my kids do?

1240
01:50:40,126 --> 01:50:43,626
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?

1241
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,751
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna

1242
01:50:46,167 --> 01:50:49,876
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero

1243
01:50:50,251 --> 01:50:52,626
If you have the guts, face me

1244
01:50:53,001 --> 01:50:54,167
Settle the score

1245
01:50:55,834 --> 01:50:58,709
The score will only be settled
when you apologise

1246
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:02,792
Get on the stage at the lnder Vihar
contest and say sorry

1247
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:03,959
And listen...

1248
01:51:04,876 --> 01:51:07,376
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...

1249
01:51:07,959 --> 01:51:12,042
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding

1250
01:51:13,251 --> 01:51:15,001
Your daughter is very cute, by God

1251
01:51:18,876 --> 01:51:21,292
- Your son is stubborn like you
- You rascal

1252
01:51:21,876 --> 01:51:25,626
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids

1253
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:31,042
What will my parents think?

1254
01:51:32,876 --> 01:51:34,167
Such a big star...

1255
01:51:36,334 --> 01:51:37,876
...with such a foul tongue

1256
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:41,792
Forget it

1257
01:51:43,126 --> 01:51:45,917
See you at the contest

1258
01:51:48,376 --> 01:51:49,959
Your son has lost his mind

1259
01:51:51,084 --> 01:51:54,167
- He's crossed the line
- Our Gaurav was not like that

1260
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:57,001
He was a good boy

1261
01:51:58,167 --> 01:52:00,042
He changed after meeting you

1262
01:52:01,251 --> 01:52:03,751
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?

1263
01:52:04,042 --> 01:52:05,792
Don't blame Aryan

1264
01:52:06,292 --> 01:52:07,417
It's our fault

1265
01:52:08,959 --> 01:52:12,167
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life

1266
01:52:13,334 --> 01:52:16,292
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example

1267
01:52:16,959 --> 01:52:20,126
Worked hard and become someone

1268
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:25,167
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife

1269
01:52:28,417 --> 01:52:29,626
He has a girlfriend?

1270
01:52:30,542 --> 01:52:33,876
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...

1271
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:37,751
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are

1272
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:42,042
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony

1273
01:52:43,292 --> 01:52:46,417
Apologise. End this terrible situation

1274
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:48,167
You think I'm wrong too?

1275
01:52:48,459 --> 01:52:49,709
And I must apologise?

1276
01:52:50,209 --> 01:52:51,501
Arrest him

1277
01:52:53,709 --> 01:52:55,709
He must be punished

1278
01:52:57,501 --> 01:53:01,292
lmprison him for years, if you must

1279
01:53:05,459 --> 01:53:06,834
But don't beat him

1280
01:53:07,959 --> 01:53:08,917
Please

1281
01:54:14,917 --> 01:54:17,501
Hey Junior. Where were you?

1282
01:54:18,084 --> 01:54:20,209
- Hello Uncle, Aunty
- Hello

1283
01:54:20,542 --> 01:54:23,251
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?

1284
01:54:24,209 --> 01:54:25,417
Never mind

1285
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:28,167
I have good news for you all

1286
01:54:28,626 --> 01:54:30,042
I've got my American visa

1287
01:54:30,417 --> 01:54:31,834
I knew it

1288
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:37,292
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him

1289
01:54:39,126 --> 01:54:41,834
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous

1290
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:43,459
Him? And nervous?

1291
01:54:43,709 --> 01:54:46,834
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1292
01:54:47,626 --> 01:54:50,292
Hey Superstar, your make-up...

1293
01:54:59,667 --> 01:55:00,209
Neha

1294
01:55:03,959 --> 01:55:05,751
I have to talk to you

1295
01:55:08,251 --> 01:55:10,626
Super surprise!

1296
01:55:11,667 --> 01:55:14,376
Western Union - moving money
for better

1297
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:17,876
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition

1298
01:55:18,667 --> 01:55:20,501
Our favourite winner

1299
01:55:20,917 --> 01:55:24,042
Our Junior Aryan Khanna

1300
01:55:28,501 --> 01:55:30,251
He's a criminal!

1301
01:55:30,876 --> 01:55:32,126
Get him off the stage

1302
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:43,626
Calm down

1303
01:55:43,834 --> 01:55:45,751
It's not the real Aryan Khanna

1304
01:55:45,959 --> 01:55:48,709
It's our very own superstar...

1305
01:55:49,251 --> 01:55:50,292
Gaurav Chandna

1306
01:55:50,501 --> 01:55:51,584
Give him a big hand!

1307
01:56:26,376 --> 01:56:29,751
I do a show for Aryan every year

1308
01:56:30,626 --> 01:56:32,876
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest

1309
01:56:34,292 --> 01:56:35,751
But this year's show...

1310
01:56:36,959 --> 01:56:38,292
The show today is for...

1311
01:56:39,876 --> 01:56:40,709
...someone else

1312
01:56:41,792 --> 01:56:44,667
The girl over there who is...

1313
01:56:45,417 --> 01:56:47,376
...smiling at me. She's my friend

1314
01:56:48,626 --> 01:56:49,584
Neha!

1315
01:56:50,459 --> 01:56:51,751
Come, babes

1316
01:56:58,334 --> 01:57:01,751
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days

1317
01:57:05,417 --> 01:57:06,084
I love you, Neha

1318
01:57:08,792 --> 01:57:10,876
- I love you too, Aryan
- Not Aryan

1319
01:57:11,251 --> 01:57:13,417
Gaurav loves you

1320
01:57:15,917 --> 01:57:18,334
Gaurav loves Neha

1321
01:57:20,417 --> 01:57:21,251
What nonsense!

1322
01:57:21,751 --> 01:57:22,459
Get lost

1323
01:57:22,709 --> 01:57:25,209
- He's nuts
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna

1324
01:57:25,459 --> 01:57:26,167
Get him off

1325
01:57:26,376 --> 01:57:29,626
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it

1326
01:57:31,959 --> 01:57:34,542
I love you!

1327
01:57:35,001 --> 01:57:37,376
Drop it. You love only Aryan

1328
01:57:37,626 --> 01:57:39,167
He can go to hell

1329
01:57:39,459 --> 01:57:42,334
- ls that you talking?
- It's not just talk

1330
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:43,917
I've sent him to hell

1331
01:57:44,917 --> 01:57:47,042
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good

1332
01:57:47,459 --> 01:57:49,834
First in London, then in Dubrovnik

1333
01:57:50,584 --> 01:57:53,042
I made my way into his house too

1334
01:57:55,876 --> 01:57:58,542
Smashed everything in sight

1335
01:57:59,792 --> 01:58:02,709
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net

1336
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:06,376
Your Gaurav is famous the world over

1337
01:58:07,459 --> 01:58:09,001
I'm no less than Aryan

1338
01:58:09,501 --> 01:58:10,709
Not at all

1339
01:58:11,959 --> 01:58:13,542
lam a star in real life

1340
01:58:14,417 --> 01:58:17,042
Not a star. A monster

1341
01:58:17,626 --> 01:58:18,459
What?

1342
01:58:18,751 --> 01:58:20,959
They all think you're a star

1343
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:23,501
While you shamed lnder Vihar

1344
01:58:23,834 --> 01:58:24,917
Listen to her

1345
01:58:25,292 --> 01:58:27,376
I became a monster for her

1346
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:29,292
I don't want to know a monster

1347
01:58:29,542 --> 01:58:31,542
A monster! Forget it

1348
01:58:31,876 --> 01:58:34,501
Take my hand and say:
“I love you too”

1349
01:58:34,834 --> 01:58:36,042
- Let go
- I won't

1350
01:58:58,376 --> 01:58:59,417
I'm very sorry, Neha

1351
01:59:00,042 --> 01:59:00,751
Are you OK?

1352
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:01,959
Thank you

1353
01:59:02,459 --> 01:59:04,876
Aryan. He's a good guy

1354
01:59:10,084 --> 01:59:10,834
Gaurav!

1355
01:59:19,667 --> 01:59:20,626
Get down!

1356
02:03:52,001 --> 02:03:53,042
Enough!

1357
02:03:54,959 --> 02:03:56,876
Enough of this game

1358
02:03:57,959 --> 02:03:58,709
Get up!

1359
02:04:04,042 --> 02:04:05,376
I am happy in my life

1360
02:04:06,584 --> 02:04:08,292
Can't you be happy in yours?

1361
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:13,292
Be a good son to your parents

1362
02:04:15,084 --> 02:04:16,876
A good friend, a good boyfriend

1363
02:04:18,751 --> 02:04:21,209
Stop being a fan

1364
02:04:28,376 --> 02:04:30,417
What's the difference between us?

1365
02:04:32,334 --> 02:04:34,209
I came from the same streets

1366
02:04:34,959 --> 02:04:36,667
I had normal parents like you

1367
02:04:37,834 --> 02:04:40,209
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends

1368
02:04:57,376 --> 02:04:59,001
I made my way up alone

1369
02:05:01,417 --> 02:05:02,917
Not in anyone's shadow

1370
02:05:06,126 --> 02:05:06,917
I'm human

1371
02:05:08,792 --> 02:05:12,459
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities

1372
02:05:13,626 --> 02:05:16,292
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans

1373
02:05:24,876 --> 02:05:26,084
I'll say it again

1374
02:05:28,251 --> 02:05:29,626
I'll forget all this

1375
02:05:30,876 --> 02:05:31,959
You do the same

1376
02:05:33,126 --> 02:05:33,959
Start over

1377
02:05:35,626 --> 02:05:37,417
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna

1378
02:05:42,084 --> 02:05:44,126
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna

1379
02:05:48,292 --> 02:05:49,126
Come!

1380
02:05:55,251 --> 02:05:57,292
The joy of living as yourself...

1381
02:05:57,876 --> 02:06:00,209
...cannot be matched by living
as another

1382
02:06:01,626 --> 02:06:02,542
Stop now

1383
02:06:04,876 --> 02:06:06,001
Live your life

1384
02:06:07,209 --> 02:06:08,542
Let me live mine

1385
02:06:17,126 --> 02:06:18,417
Where to, Senior?

1386
02:06:20,292 --> 02:06:22,876
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1387
02:06:27,126 --> 02:06:28,126
And my life?

1388
02:06:31,001 --> 02:06:33,292
You took everything from me

1389
02:06:35,459 --> 02:06:37,042
My parents' love

1390
02:06:37,959 --> 02:06:39,501
Neha's friendship

1391
02:06:41,834 --> 02:06:43,709
My neighbours' smiles

1392
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:54,876
You were my lifeline, Senior

1393
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:59,001
You cut the connection

1394
02:07:00,876 --> 02:07:03,501
OK. I'll do as you say

1395
02:07:06,167 --> 02:07:07,542
I'll stop this game

1396
02:07:12,501 --> 02:07:14,501
I can separate myself from you

1397
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:21,167
But you can never separate
my name from yours

1398
02:07:27,917 --> 02:07:29,167
You said everything

1399
02:07:32,751 --> 02:07:34,334
But you never said sorry

1400
02:07:39,501 --> 02:07:40,251
Gaurav!

1401
02:07:41,167 --> 02:07:42,251
No, Gaurav

1402
02:07:43,376 --> 02:07:44,417
It's not over

1403
02:07:44,876 --> 02:07:46,376
Think of your parents

1404
02:07:48,792 --> 02:07:49,709
Stop this madness

1405
02:08:07,376 --> 02:08:10,917
Forget it. You won't understand

1406
02:09:57,251 --> 02:10:01,251
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely

1407
02:10:01,834 --> 02:10:05,167
But lnder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...

1408
02:10:05,626 --> 02:10:08,709
...has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever

1409
02:10:09,126 --> 02:10:13,001
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today

1410
02:10:13,251 --> 02:10:18,126
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands

1411
02:10:20,042 --> 02:10:21,001
It's time

1412
02:10:24,709 --> 02:10:26,251
Everyone is waiting
