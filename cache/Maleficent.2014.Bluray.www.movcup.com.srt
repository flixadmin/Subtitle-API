00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,434
Once upon a time,
there were two kingdoms

4
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,603
that were the worst of neighbours.

5
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,606
So vast was the discord between them

6
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,317
that it was said only a great hero

7
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,696
or a terrible villain
might bring them together.

8
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,074
In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,

9
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,477
with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.

10
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,122
They were forever discontent,

11
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:05,275
and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbours.

12
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,837
For in the other kingdom, the Moors,

13
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:12,991
lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.

14
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,344
And they needed
neither king nor queen,

15
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,996
but trusted in one another.

16
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,310
In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors

17
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,771
lived one such spirit.

18
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,758
You might take her for a girl,

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,344
but she was not just any girl.

20
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,347
She was a fairy.

was Maleficent.

NARRATOR: Maleficent thought of
how Stefan cast away his ring,

106
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,758
he who had so little in the world,

107
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,743
so that their hands might touch again,

108
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,580
and her heart was moved.

109
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,557
Thus did the young thief

110

who had hoped to steal a jewel...

Steal something far more precious.

NARRATOR: Stefan and Maleficent
became the most unlikely of friends.

123
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,016
And for a time it seemed as if,

124
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,376
in them at least,

125
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,797
the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.

126

As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.

And on her 16th birthday,

128
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,772
Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.

129
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,735
He told her it was true love's kiss.

130
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,824
But it was not to be.

131

As the years passed,

132
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,764
Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,

133
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,585
and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.

134
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,272
While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,

00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,258
rose to become
the protector of the Moors.

136

Maleficent often wandered alone

137
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,144
and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,

138
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,023
for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.

both hero and villain.

1013
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:15,959
And her name was Maleficent.

1014
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:19,045
(CAWING)

1015
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:55,348
WOMAN:(SINGING)I know you

1016
01:28:55,373 --> 01:29:02,088
I walked with you once upon a dream

1017
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:07,552
I know you

1018
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:14,701
That look in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

1019
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:19,247
And I know it's true

1020
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:25,820
That visions are seldom all they seem

1021
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:29,841
But if I know you

1022
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:33,094
I know what you'll do

1023
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,139
You'll love me at once

1024
01:29:36,164 --> 01:29:43,129
The way you did once upon a dream

1025
01:30:02,523 --> 01:30:05,752
But if I know you

1026
01:30:05,777 --> 01:30:08,963
I know what you'll do

1027
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:12,008
You'll love me at once

1028
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:18,998
The way you did once upon a dream

1029
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:31,527
I know you

1030
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:38,017
I walked with you once upon a dream

1031
01:30:39,519 --> 01:30:43,414
I know you

1032
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:50,363
That gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam

1033
01:30:50,613 --> 01:30:55,551
And I know it's true

1034
01:30:55,576 --> 01:31:01,541
That visions are seldom all they seem

1035
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:05,978
But if I know you

1036
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:09,398
I know what you'll do

1037
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:11,984
You'll love me at once

1038
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:18,975
The way you did once upon a dream

1039
00:00:00,000 --> 01:40:39,636
