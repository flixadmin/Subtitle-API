00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,128
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,614
Alfred.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,273
- The manor.
- It's my fault.

4
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:11,636
Mr. Cobblepot.

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,013
(Oswald shouts)

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,881
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me!

7
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,673
You're having a baby with Barbara.

8
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:20,938
BARBARA: <i>You don't think I'm fit</i>

9
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,240
- to be a mother?
- What do you think?

10
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,576
- You're leaving Gotham.
- OSWALD:<i> I believe the time</i>

11
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>has come for a change of scenery.</i>

12
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:30,197
You found a way out of Gotham?

13
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:31,740
It's a submarine.

14
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,576
Reunification with the mainland hangs on

15
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>by a thread. Toxic chemicals
rain down onto the city,</i>

16
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>and the government
cuts us adrift for good.</i>

17
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,086
DIX: <i>Gotham's Golden Rule.</i>

18
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:45,504
No heroes.

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,005
No heroes.

20
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,382
DIX: Watch out for him.

21
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,767
He thinks he's a white knight.

22
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,103
<i>He's a loose cannon.</i>

23
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,650
("Fever" by Thunderpussy playing)

24
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,949
You two here to pick up
your grandchildren?

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,033
Come on, Babs.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,294
You got the only full bar in Gotham.

27
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,823
And if you two dinosaurs want
to keep coming here,

28
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,456
you better up your intel.

29
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,876
We got a lead on
some black market heating oil.

To share.

33
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,310

Dix! Look at you,

38
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,508
up and walking around,
you old son of a bitch.

39
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,905
I've been looking for you two
for a while now.

40
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,499
Well, you found us.

41
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:58,910
You two ever think about the past?

42
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,838
What we did?

43
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,165
What are you talking about, Dix?

44
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,916
About her.

45
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:08,053
About what we did to the girl.

46
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,683
BARBARA: Who is that? It is like

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,436
the living dead in here. Enough of this.

48
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:18,930

ALFRED: Can you please repeat
your story for Mr. Wayne, madam?

57
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,787
We live in the shelter on West End.

58
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,044
There are so many of us
crammed in there. Uh...

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,960
so much uncertainty, fear.

60
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,664
And with the river poisoned,
it should've been awful,

61
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,167
but... people came together,

62
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,960
made it a home.

63
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,716
What happened?

64
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,853
Couple of weeks ago, we...

65
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,841
heard rumors about something
underneath the building...

66
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,210
(exhales)

67
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:05,718
...where it connects to the sewer.

68
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,765
Then people started going missing.

69
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,090
Hank, my husband,

70
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,641
wanted to look for them.

71
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,168
Said we were a family.

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,826
So the two of you
went searching for them.

73
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,559
It was so dark.

74
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,519
I didn't see what attacked us.

75
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:28,520
(exhales)

76
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,947
I hit my head.

77
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,783
And when I woke up, Hank was gone.

78
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,396
Please, Mr. Wayne.

79
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,428
We have a daughter.

80
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,871
We'll do everything we can.

81
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,960
Should we tell Gordon?

82
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,265
He's stretched thin as it is.

83
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,173
Alfred, we don't know who
or what is down there.

84
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,994
We know there's a man
down there, in danger,

85
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,064
and we know this lady sent for us.

86
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:05,149
So go on, then. What do
you think we should do?

87
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,776
Let's go find him.

88
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,054
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't call you

89
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,663
for a couple of stiffs.

90
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,976
What do you normally do when a couple
of your patrons get stabbed?

91
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,253
Bury the bodies.

92
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,023
Find out who did it and
then bury those bodies.

93
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,163
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

94
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,998
We're living
in a different world, Harvey.

95
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,031
- GORDON: So why<i> did</i> you call us?
- Take a look.

96
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,789
Boggs and Lewis.

97
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,136
You know them?

98
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,554
They were cops.

99
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,766
They were gone before you joined.

100
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,313
- What happened?
- They came around,

101
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,219
peddling third-rate intel.

102
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,000
It was closing time, so I let 'em in.

103
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,213
And then some other fossil knifed them.

104
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,500
You saw him?

105
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,390
Yeah, he must've snuck in.
Looked like a cop, too.

106
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,570
These two knew him.

107
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,278
Bartender said they called him

108
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,071
Micks... Hicks...

109
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:55,783
- Dix?
- Maybe.

110
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,056
No way.

111
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,105
Dix was Harvey's old partner.

112
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,030
Well, there we go. Case closed.

113
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,592
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

114
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,232
stabbed these two, and rolled on out?

115
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,180
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

116
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,756
Then it couldn't be Dix.
He's been paralyzed

117
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,850
for the last 15 years.

118
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,824
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

119
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,672
I called you as a courtesy.
And now I'm wishing

120
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,340
I just dumped these two
corpses in an alley.

121
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,133
Do we even know
if Dix is still in Gotham

122
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,599
after the bridges blew?

123
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,140
I heard he moved into an
apartment about a year ago.

124
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:28,382
I meant to check up on him,
but... it can't be him.

125
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,576
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

126
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,209
Maybe he knows something.

127
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,283
Fine.

128
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,749
(sighs)

129
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,084
How are you feeling?

130
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,753
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
- Look,

131
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,747
I've been giving you space,

132
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,237
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

133
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,768
I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life.

134
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,721
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

135
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,914
I am.

136
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,648
Reunification's gonna happen.

137
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,905
You should think
about what kind of person

138
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,603
you want to be when it does.

139
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,886
It's a chance for you to start anew.

140
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,347
I like who I am.

141
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,274
Uh-huh.

142
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,837
(exhales)

143
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,756
(jangling)

144
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,755
You were due hours ago.

145
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,403
Yes, I was.

146
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,008
But I had to get us lunch.

147
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,515
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

148
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,888
Do you see this?

149
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:52,687
Our<i> secret</i> plan to get off this island.

150
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,842
Relax.

151
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,425
Dale is completely trustworthy.

152
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,715
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

153
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,218
Because he's mute and dumb as a post.

154
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,042
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us.

155
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:07,316
Someone<i> is</i> watching us!

156
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:11,019
Why do you think I installed
this alarm system?

157
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,114
(Oswald chuckles)

158
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,530
And as safe as I feel

159
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,816
with your jingle bell
contraption in place,

160
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,901
I went out and procured us some muscle.

161
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:20,153
You're welcome.

162
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,239
(quietly): At least
you're doing something.

163
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,782
Ah.

164
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,085
How's my SS<i> Gertrud</i> coming along?

165
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:30,330
<i>Our</i> submarine is coming along
just fine, thank you.

166
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:32,082
I've been working on the sonar,

167
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,167
which, turns out, is...

168
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,564
far more complex than I anticipated.

169
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,056
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

170
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,844
Of course I will figure it out.

171
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:47,598
Because I figure everything out.

172
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,859
The navigation system.

173
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,861
The oxygen exchange.

174
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,270
I will figure everything out,

175
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,198
because I'm the only one working!

176
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,675
This was supposed to be a partnership.

177
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,035
It is!

178
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,278
I already did my part

179
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,330
by stealing everything valuable
in Gotham,

180
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,627
- of which you get half!
- No!

181
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:06,823
Your goons stole it,

182
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,786
- and then you killed 'em.
- (jangling)

183
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:11,955
Are you expecting someone?

184
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,472
Who would I be expecting, Oswald?

185
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,217
I told you someone's watching us.

186
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,636
Dale, go do what I pay you for.

187
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,675
Protect us!

188
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:26,137
Wait!

189
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,380
Penn?

190
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,935
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

191
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,236
(stammers)

192
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,283
Are you... are you really... I...

193
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,615
I-I don't believe it. Y-You're alive.

194
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,452
Indeed, sir. I-I am.

195
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,640
But you-you were shot. I-I was there.

196
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,915
This whole time,

197
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,083
I thought you were dead,

198
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,642
but you're alive! (laughs)

199
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,465
You're only coming to me<i> now?!</i>

200
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,925
I-I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

201
00:08:57,002 --> 00:09:00,343
I wanted to come see you, but...

202
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,474
he wouldn't let me.

203
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,975
"He"?

204
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,977
"He" who?

205
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,187
(scoffing)

206
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,951
Mr. Cobblepot...

207
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:13,843
...this...

208
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,287
is...

209
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:21,616
...Mr. Scarface.

210
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,452
Wonderful.

211
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,170
GORDON: <i>Look,
I'm sure Dix is in the clear,</i>

212
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:39,312
but we do have to ask.

213
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,011
(sighs)

214
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,805
That's not it.

215
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,057
I just... I feel bad.

216
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,774
I should've been by before.
I'm all he's got.

217
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,394
Well, look,

218
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,521
what can you do, right?

219
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,695
Dix!

220
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,914
What the hell?!

221
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,082
Bullock?

222
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,491
That you?

223
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,700
Yeah!

224
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:04,919
Don't shoot!

225
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,420
Okay.

226
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:08,997
Come in.

227
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,333
Uh-huh.

228
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,427
Is that the way
you always answer a door?

229
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,517
Nowadays, you can't be too careful.

230
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,433
Especially someone like me.

231
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,749
A kid comes in,

232
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,269
he'd cut my throat for a cup of soup.

233
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,366
BULLOCK: Uh-huh.

234
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,890
DIX: Anyway, I wasn't expecting you.

235
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,599
Figured you forgot about me.

236
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,178
Look, partner,

237
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,945
when the bridges came down,
I got busy and...

238
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,605
Oh, sure, sure. You forgot me.

239
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,291
Everybody forgets.

240
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:36,951
I didn't forget.

241
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,558
Planning on taking a trip?

242
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,864
Maybe.

243
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,624
I like to keep a bag
packed, just in case.

244
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,218
Yeah? Where were you last night?

245
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,461
Where was I?

246
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:49,246
I was right here.

247
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,356
Anybody else here with you?

248
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,082
Anybody that can back up your story?

249
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,165
You're asking me
if I was out there killing

250
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,345
Boggs and Lewis?

251
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,977
Does it look like I was out
there killing Boggs and Lewis?

252
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,145
So you heard about that?

253
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,449
Let me tell you something.

254
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,814
If it meant

255
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,474
that I can get out of
this son of a bitch wheelchair,

256
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,812
I would confess right here
and now to Boggs, to Lewis,

257
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,788
to anybody you want me to confess to.

258
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:18,366
All right, fine.
But you were a detective.

259
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,827
What would you say if you were us?

260
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,491
We come in here, you're
packing a suitcase.

261
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:27,081
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't,

262
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:30,954
or I'd be very worried that I'd be next.

263
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,694
What do you mean, you being next?

264
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,009
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

265
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,295
Come on. What?

266
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,591
Nothing. I just worked
with them. That's it.

267
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:47,229
We, uh... we worked a case together.

268
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,765
The four of you?

269
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,433
BULLOCK: Yeah.

270
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,099
- (bird cooing)
- Dix wasn't my partner then.

271
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:56,146
I was a rookie cop.

272
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,856
Wet behind the ears.

273
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,815
So what was the case?

274
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,317
Woman killed her husband.

275
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,487
As far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

276
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,206
But at least we can agree
that Dix didn't walk

277
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:08,441
into The Sirens and stab those two guys.

278
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:13,081
So who did? Barbara said Boggs
and Lewis recognized the killer.

279
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,463
They called him "Dix."

280
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,416
We come in here, he's packing
a suitcase, he shoots at us.

281
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,955
- This stinks, Harvey.
- (knocking at door)

282
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,060
(knocking continues)

283
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,228
(wheels squeaking)

284
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,740
Hey. (grunts)

285
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,827
(grunts)

286
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,297
GORDON: You all right?

287
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,146
What the hell?

288
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:52,254
(birds squawking)

289
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,390
(footsteps)

290
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,638
ALFRED: These basements run
along Gotham's sewers.

291
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,365
The river is right next to it.

292
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,848
You mean the river filled
with Jeremiah's toxins?

293
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,329
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do?

294
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,081
Yeah, you're right.

295
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,509
(rats squeaking)

296
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,336
Just don't you touch anything.

297
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,430
(low growling)

298
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,811
(water dripping)

299
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,712
ALFRED: Hold on.

300
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,197
Oh.

301
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,208
Bite marks.

302
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,785
Animal?

303
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,788
Well, it's no human I've ever seen.

304
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,799
Whatever it was...

305
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:57,664
...it dragged him that way.

306
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,673
Seems like human skin.

307
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,967
Here's the file you asked for.

308
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,302
Victoria Cartwright.

309
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,614
- How'd you, uh...?
- I had Harper

310
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,556
run every case the four of you worked,

311
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,568
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

312
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,561
Do I need to read it, or are
you gonna tell me what's in it?

313
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,188
Victoria Cartwright was a banker.

314
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,024
She led a very boring life.

315
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,859
DIX: Until she snapped and

316
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,820
put two .38 caliber slugs
into her husband.

317
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,405
End of story.

318
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,567
You guys rehearse that?

319
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,089
Says there was no physical evidence.

320
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,706
She was convicted on the statement

321
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:37,834
of her seven-year-old daughter, Jane.

322
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,253
This was 20 years ago. Where's Jane now?

323
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:42,114
What's the point? The killer's a man.

324
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:44,348
A man that can imitate friggin' faces.

325
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,983
What was the name
of the guy that Strange

326
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,390
got to imitate you? A Basil something?

327
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,107
That's who we should be looking for.

328
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:52,249
That was different, and you know it.

329
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,663
Do we have an address for this Jane?

330
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,102
No. But the family's old
home is in the Green Zone,

331
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,806
- just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

332
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,493
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

333
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,278
You know what? Why don't you hang back?

334
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,246
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You benching me?

335
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,792
Killer's still out there.
Keep an eye on your partner.

336
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,966
OSWALD: Penn. Arnold.

337
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,872
It's... Arthur.

338
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,808
(chuckling) You're holding a doll.

339
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,802
It's not a doll.

340
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,062
It's a dummy.

341
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,257
Oh, this is great.

342
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,571
I'm going back to work.

343
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,696
- Excuse me.
- You're saying

344
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,218
he made you come here?

345
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,512
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

346
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,222
(chuckling)

347
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,066
Persuasive?

348
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,548
He made me tell him about your...

349
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,073
(quietly): treasure.

350
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,714
Penn...

351
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,222
I think you need a rest.

352
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,797
And perhaps a psychiatrist.

353
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,975
Then we can discuss
you resuming your former duties.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,080
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone.

355
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,726
Shut your piehole!

356
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,347
This the one you were telling me about?

357
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,472
Punk who thinks he's in charge?

358
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:15,517
Yes, sir.

359
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,302
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

360
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:20,555
Oswald, if you don't
make him leave, I will.

361
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,725
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

362
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,236
Penn,

363
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:28,431
show these dewdroppers we're serious.

364
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,123
Forgive me.

365
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,410
(cries out)

366
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,582
(Oswald panting)

367
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:42,418
Now, let's talk turkey...

368
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,026
turkeys.

369
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:47,932
(indistinct chatter, typing)

370
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,020
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

371
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,727
(sighs) Boggs and Lewis were
idiots, complete idiots.

372
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,482
They should've known when
they see a guy walking,

373
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,453
that it ain't me.

374
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,463
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

375
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,792
How would I know?

376
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:10,964
So, how you been
since the bridges came down?

377
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,287
You getting enough food?

378
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,542
Medicine?

379
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,388
What if I said "no"?

380
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,669
I'd feel like crap.

381
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,618
Then no.

382
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,385
(chuckling)

383
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,388
The Cartwright girl is dead.

384
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,380
A buddy of mine, who was a screw
over at Arkham, he said

385
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,857
she was an inmate there, and
she died a couple of years ago,

386
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,122
so this has nothing to do with her.

387
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,239
GCPD!

388
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,074
Coming in.

389
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,993
(door creaking)

390
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,669
Check upstairs.

391
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,433
HARPER: Looks like this place

392
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,839
has been abandoned since
before the bridges came down.

393
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,511
Yeah.

394
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,789
(wooden creaking)

395
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:52,374
(loud breathing)

396
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,885
(wooden creaking)

397
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,008
What the hell?

398
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,386
(sighs)

399
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,313

What's that smell?

410
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,351

00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,560
(footsteps approaching)

412
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,801
Everything all right?

413
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,533
All good. No one's here.

414
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:52,396
Hey!

415
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:54,004
(grunting)

416
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:00,118
(groans)

417
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:07,860
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

418
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,517
GORDON: We found your handiwork.

419
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:17,653
(fan whooshing rhythmically)

420
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,250
Nothing to say?

421
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:27,171
You're gonna have to take that mask off.

422
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:31,207
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

423
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,717
<i>Otherwise,
I'm gonna reach over this table,</i>

424
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:35,021
<i>and I'm gonna rip it off of your face.</i>

425
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,668
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

426
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,054
You're not Jane Cartwright?

427
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,789
Because you were in her childhood home.

428
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,684
You're about the right age.

429
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,938
Talk to me, Jane.

430
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,803
I know after your mother

431
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,852
was convicted, you ended up
a ward of the state.

432
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,418
In and out of institutions
until you ended up in Arkham.

433
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,997
Then you vanished.

434
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,137
Some say died.

435
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,002
What happened to you?

436
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,669
Me?

437
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:14,765
Nothing happened to me.

438
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,200
Okay.

439
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,459
What happened to Jane?

440
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh.

441
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,907
Lots happened to Jane.

442
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,195
She was taken from Arkham.

443
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,921
Down, down...

444
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,226
down, the doctor did things to her,

445
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:43,968
experiments on her and others.

446
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,705
You're talking about Hugo Strange?

447
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,406
You were taken to Indian Hill?

448
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,102
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

449
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,993
The way a chameleon
would change its skin.

450
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,406
He wanted humans to have that power.

451
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,127
He made it so Jane
could change her skin...

452
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,316
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

453
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:07,525
All it takes is a single touch,

454
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:10,043
and her body becomes a mirror.

455
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:14,196
When it's done, she sheds
her skin and starts anew.

456
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,163
It remembers everyone it touched.

457
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,517
It's touched you, Detective.

458
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:30,168
<i>We can help you, Ms. Cartwright.</i>

459
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:33,510
Jane Cartwright is dead.

460
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,276
She died in Arkham.

461
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:41,763
That's when Jane Doe was born.

462
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,638
So why kill all these cops?

463
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:51,402
Do you want to know why they died?

464
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,231

happened after Haven.

499
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,350
Help me to understand...

500
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:25,952
this.

501
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,234
Go on.

502
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:31,796
Sing your song.

503
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:35,951
After I was shot...

504
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,272
I woke up in the GCPD morgue.

505
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,072
I was alone.

506
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:46,368
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

507
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,717
I hid in a store.

508
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,040
An abandoned magic shop.

509
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,373
That's where Mr. Scarface found me.

510
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,357
And he told me all about you.

511
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:03,469
How you used him.

512
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:06,375
Chewed him up and spat him out.

513
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,312
Treated him like a palooka!

514
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,414
That's a lie!

515
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:13,738
Oh, please, Oswald. It's what you do.

516
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:14,854
Arnold...

517
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:16,957
Arthur.

518
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,098
What do you want?

519
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:20,109
I don't want anything.

520
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,693
But Mr. Scarface, well...

521
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,419
...he wants your treasure.

522
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,479
And...

523
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:30,052
to be boss.

524
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,455
(laughs)

525
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:34,040
Really?

526
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:38,804
The-the dummy wants to be
the boss of Gotham?

527
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,316
Bingo! Now, give me the key

528
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,320
- to your treasure room.
- Why would I do that?

529
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:45,268
You're obviously gonna kill me anyway.

530
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,601
What am I doing?

531
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:49,842
I'm talking to a doll.

532
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,031
Dummy.

533
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,143
- Seriously?
- You know what, Oswald?

534
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:54,821
Honestly, you deserve this.

535
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:57,884
- Nobody asked you.
- You are opportunistic,

536
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:01,017
your loyalty is... shaky, at best,

537
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:04,831
and you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

538
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,769
I hardly think you're
one to throw stones!

539
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,115
- Listen, Penn...
- Eyes down here, pal.

540
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,678
(chuckles) Sorry.

541
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,881
Mr. Scarface, I got a question for you.

542
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,230
Shoot. (chuckles)

543
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,406
(chuckles)

544
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:23,439
After you get your...

545
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,793
tiny wooden hands on that treasure,

546
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:26,846
what are you gonna do?

547
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,229
Where are you gonna go?

548
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,064
People are gonna come
after you eventually.

549
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,992
Then I'll, uh...

550
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,346
I'll take 'em all on! Yeah.

551
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:37,941
- Show 'em who's boss.
- Ah.

552
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,601
You wouldn't have to do that

553
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,765
if you could get off this
island, now, would you?

554
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,648
What are you doing?

555
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:47,781
Shut it! Let the smart one talk.

556
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,003
How do<i> you</i> feel...

557
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,210
about submarines?

558
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:58,968
(indistinct chatter in distance)

559
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,762
What are we doing here?

560
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:02,847
I just wanted to take us, uh,

561
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,807
someplace quiet

562
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,694
where we could talk.

563
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:12,771
- We did a bad thing.
- Oh, come on, not that again.

564
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,308
We put a killer in jail, all right?

565
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,785
What do you keep moping about?

566
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,998
She was guilty.
She got what she deserved.

567
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,239
Drop it.

568
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,169
Did you get what <i>you</i> deserved?

569
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,368
What?

570
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,548
You made that girl into a murderer.

571
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,050
Oh, come on.

572
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:31,459
You...

573
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,003
your friends...

574
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,956
- the kid.
- Come on, you're...

575
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:39,300
I'm gonna make sure you
never do that again.

576
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,978
(grunting)

577
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,375
Harper, where's Dix?

578
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,644
I saw Bullock take him in the back.

579
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,461
Barbara. What are you doing here?

580
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:55,303
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

581
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,373
before he ice-picked Harvey's pals.

582
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,194
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

583
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:00,873
Okay.

584
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,966
"The kid's guilty, too."

585
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,425
The kid.

586
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:08,616
Listen... what you said before,

587
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,694
about me being a known criminal.

588
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:13,251
I was on some list your army buddy had.

589
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,585
When the government rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

590
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,780
(sighs) Honestly, I don't know.

591
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,547
But that would work out for you, right?

592
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:22,088
I go to jail. You get the baby.

593
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,536
I don't want that.

594
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,719
Is that a promise?

595
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,704
I go straight, I'm clear?

596
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,041
Stay right here.

597
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:31,956
Hey, Harvey, where'd you take Dix?

598
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:34,292
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

599
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,687
Oh, God. Oh.

600
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,558
She got into your locker.
Must have taken your clothes.

601
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,695
We have to lock down the GCPD.

602
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:50,804
Hey, Harvey.

603
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:53,149
We'll find her.

604
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,575
Come on.

605
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,656
(screaming)

606
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,491
Look at the size of it.

607
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,308
(roaring)

608
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,652
Living down here,

609
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,700
the toxins in the river

610
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,614
must have driven him mad.
Get out of here! Now!

611
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,467
(grunting)

612
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,098
(yells in pain)

613
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,945
Alfred!

614
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,626
- I'm sorry!
- Alfred!

615
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,393
Alfred! Stop!

616
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,338
(weak, raspy breathing): Stop. Stop...

617
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:53,801
(weak growling)

618
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,466
All right, everybody, listen up.

619
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,532
GCPD is now in lockdown.

620
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,764
Nobody goes in or out unless I say so.

621
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,172
She could look like anybody by now.

622
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,830
How are we supposed to find her?

623
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,429
(panting): Jim!

624
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,886
Barbara? What happened?

625
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:21,207
What do you mean, what happened?
I've been attacked.

626
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,551
Where'd she go?

627
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,920
Wait a minute.

628
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,819
How do we know it's really you?

629
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,041
Seriously?

630
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:31,303
This isn't proof enough?

631
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,492
- What the hell?
- That's her.

632
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,224
She's the imposter. Shoot her!

633
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:41,433
It's me, you idiot.

634
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:43,805
That sounds like Barbara.

635
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:47,672
Barbara.

636
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,725
Tell me where we first met.

637
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:55,614
Don't shoot.

638
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,449
I'm leaving here.

639
00:32:57,525 --> 00:33:00,327
Anyone tries to follow me, she dies.

640
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:04,289
- Shoot her.
- We can't risk it.

641
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,110
- Stay back!
- (grunts)

642
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:11,798
Bullock, wait!

643
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,886
I'm fine.

644
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,105
All right, take her to my office.

645
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,549
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Okay.

646
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,470
(grunts)

647
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,008
I cannot believe that you
told him about the sub.

648
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,282
And that you're playing
along with his psychosis.

649
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,232
Obviously, he was gonna kill you.

650
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,368
I bought us time.

651
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:46,611
I have an idea.

652
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,712
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

653
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,322
Wait, what's the signal?

654
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,733
Quit your jawing.

655
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,580
So...

656
00:33:54,657 --> 00:34:00,178
Mr. Scarface and I
have discussed our options.

657
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,548
And the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

658
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,453
SCARFACE: And since we'll need

659
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,852
the smart one to build this hayburner,

660
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,096
he can keep sucking air.

661
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,357
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

662
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,858
Do it, Penn.

663
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,860
Ventilate that mook.

664
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,565
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.
- Oh.

665
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,704
I wish things would've
turned out differently.

666
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:29,309
Arthur, I want you to listen
to what I'm saying.

667
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,742
You accuse me of manipulating you,
but what about him?

668
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,087
I never asked you to kill anybody.

669
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,767
- That is true.
- Hey.

670
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,877
Think of everything
that we went through together.

671
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,751
Sofia Falcone.

672
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,665
Getting cut off
from the mainland. Starving.

673
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,923
You mean Penn was starving!

674
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,226
Fighting for scraps
while your dog ate steak.

675
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:55,299
I welcomed you into my home.

676
00:34:56,283 --> 00:35:00,146
And yes, I was not a good friend.

677
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,865
To you or to anyone.

678
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:07,019
It's why I'm alone.

679
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,088
But I saw you for what you are,

680
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:13,428
and I valued that.

681
00:35:13,453 --> 00:35:14,545
(laughs)

682
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,203
That must be worth something.

683
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:21,533
Applesauce!

684
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,994
You're a liar and a thief.

685
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,714
All you do is take,

686
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:28,136
take...

687
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,714
PENN: Take.

688
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,401
And you never give anything.

689
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,209
You worked me to the bone.

690
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,312
Forced me to be your puppet.

691
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,152
Well, no more.

692
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:45,856
You hear me?

693
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:49,317
No more.

694
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:51,910
- (sonar pings)
- (shouts)

695
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,955
SCARFACE: Take that. And that.

696
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:57,840
(both grunting)

697
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,306
- No.
- (screams)

698
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:08,384
(panting)

699
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:11,238
Mr. Cobblepot.

700
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,598
You freed me. (chuckles)

701
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,505
How can I ever thank you?

702
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:20,373
- (gunshot)
- Aah!

703
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:22,930
(Oswald panting)

704
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,527
Why did you do that?

705
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:28,855
He wasn't the threat.
The dummy was the threat.

706
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,746
Oswald.

707
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,312
I accept you for the
person that you are.

708
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:38,325
Just as you accept me for
the cold logician that I am.

709
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,396
That's why this friendship is great.

710
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,669
And as friends,

711
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:46,083
I think we can both
agree that that lunatic

712
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:48,159
had to be stopped.

713
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:50,727
(chuckling softly)

714
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,515
Perhaps, Edward...

715
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:59,477
we really are meant for each other.

716
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:01,487
(both laughing)

717
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:14,959
(floorboards creaking)

718
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,967
Jane.

719
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:29,974
I know you're up here.

720
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,788
Jane. I knew you'd be here.

721
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,912
I'm sorry.

722
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,500
It was my job to protect you,
and I let you down.

723
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:59,955
You made Jane into a killer.

724
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,874
You and your friends.
There have to be consequences.

725
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,116
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

726
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:09,931
When you're dead.

727
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:12,880
Put the gun down!

728
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:15,288
Shoot me.

729
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:19,639
You killed Jane years ago,
and you didn't even know it.

730
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:21,764
Just shoot me.

731
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:31,340
Let me see your face.

732
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,905
Your real face.

733
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,741
(voice breaking): Why? So you can see
what a monster she is?

734
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:44,598
Hugo Strange only destroyed her face.

735
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:46,774
You destroyed her soul.

736
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,571
Let me see it.

737
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,583
(crying)

738
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,765
You see?

739
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,835
You see what they did?

740
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,247
Jane...

741
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,233
we can work this out.

742
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,936
Just put the gun down.

743
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:36,256
The only way this ends is
with one of us dead.

744
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,126
Oh, Hank, thank God you're alive.

745
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:58,790
The nurse thinks the man that
attacked us will never recover.

746
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:00,111
The toxins in the river

747
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:02,782
have done irreparable damage
to his brain.

748
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,415
I just think it's a
shame we couldn't save

749
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:07,076
the rest of the people who
went missing, Master Bruce.

750
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,403
We should've went to Gordon
from the start.

751
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,801
- We were reckless.
- Ah, that's nonsense.

752
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:14,456
We took decisive action.
We saved a man's life.

753
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,196
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce.

754
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:19,011
They need someone that
will protect them.

755
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:22,640
I agree.

756
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,681
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

757
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:31,291
I, um, I don't follow.

758
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:34,191
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

759
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:37,746
I know you've been blaming yourself.

760
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,800
You didn't destroy our home, Alfred.

761
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:42,693
But I feel like I did.

762
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,568
I feel like I wasn't strong enough

763
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,357
to fight Tetch or that bastard Valeska.

764
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,928
I feel like because of my weakness,

765
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:54,968
you lost your last tie to the past.

766
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,430
You lost your home, Master Bruce.

767
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,755
I must never be that weak again.

768
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:10,884
Part of being a family
is that we can be strong

769
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:12,866
for each other.

770
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,647
And when did you get so smart?

771
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:23,139
I had a good teacher.

772
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,641
Victoria Cartwright killed her husband.

773
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:33,349
After we arrested her, she admitted it.

774
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:35,550
Later, she recanted.

775
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,768
But the physical evidence wasn't there.

776
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,808
I was a new cop.
I wanted to make detective.

777
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:44,245
So you leaned on Jane.

778
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Coerced a statement out of
her to put her mother away.

779
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:50,324
The woman was guilty.

780
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,136
Later I found out the husband...

781
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,943
beat the mother and Jane.

782
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,711
I didn't know till after.

783
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:06,047
The bartender overheard Jane
say something about,

784
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,754
"the kid's guilty, too."

785
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,731
She meant the young cop.

786
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,048
She meant you.

787
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,108
I knew something was wrong.

788
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,465
I felt it.

789
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,957
I said something, and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

790
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:28,812
just close the case, put a bow on it.

791
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:34,471
After a while, I stopped feeling it.

792
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:38,648
And I went down that path
for a long time

793
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,281
until I met you.

794
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,540
However much I've changed...

795
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:51,227
I can't change the past.

796
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,879
I made that girl a killer.

797
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,793
What do you want from me, Harvey?

798
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:02,614
Forgiveness?

799
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,714
Can't give that to you.

800
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:11,058
I just needed you to know.

801
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:31,128
