1
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,120
Here to the right.

2
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,460
Stop.

3
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,180
Stay here.

4
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,520
Who's there?

5
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,610
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

6
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,910
Stay right there!

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,410
Relax.

8
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,170
How are the cows?

9
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,030
The cops came here... a few months ago.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,700
What did you tell them?

11
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,950
The truth.

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,500
That I haven't seen you in years.

13
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,920
You've gotten old, Pablo.

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,970
It happens.

15
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,520
You look younger.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,810
That happens.

17
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,610
Life in the country keeps you young.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,610
Be careful, it's hot.

19
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,160
What's your name?

20
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,700
Limón, sir.

21
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,670
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,790
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,260
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

24
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,630
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,600
All right, gentlemen.

26
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,770
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

27
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,690
Good night.

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,270
Good night, Dad.

29
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,850
It is the state, not individuals,
that has justice in its hands

30
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,440
and the legitimacy to use arms.

31
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,810
Gilberto's no longer our partner.
I don't care what he thinks.

32
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,310
Have you seen the news?

33
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,360
They issued a statement without us.

34
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Los Pepes is done.

35
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,070
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

36
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,080
No one told me anything.

37
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,410
Listen to me, Berna.

38
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,790
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

39
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,750
We don't need anybody else.

40
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,210
Start moving this product now.

41
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,130
That's all fine, Judy.

42
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,930
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

43
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,050
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 billion for Los Pepes?

44
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,430
I know where they are.

45
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,690
Be careful what you say.

46
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,230
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

47
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,980
I'm not interested in the reward.

48
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm interested in my labs.

49
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,910
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

50
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Sir?

51
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,800
Hello.

52
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,550
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

53
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,720
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

54
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,470
This place is full of product.

55
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,970
What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

56
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,150
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

57
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,560
against the communists in the jungle.

58
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,030
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

59
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,440
And what do we do about Judy?

60
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,820
Do whatever you think is best.

61
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,450
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

62
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,460
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

63
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,670
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

64
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
We'll learn.

65
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,300
If they can, why not us?

66
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,260
And what about Judy?

67
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,480
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

68
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,770
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

69
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,510
- Fabian.
- Yes?

70
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,470
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

71
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,100
Hurry up, Berna.

72
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,230
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

73
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,230
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

74
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,360
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

75
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,110
Three in each.

76
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,280
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

77
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,910
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

78
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes, sir.

79
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,360
- Peña.
- Javier.

80
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,530
- What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

81
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm busy. I can't talk.

82
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,290
There's been an attempt on Judy.

83
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,500
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

84
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,130
Give me time.

85
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,370
- Peña.
- Mr. Peña has arrived.

86
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's go. Search.

87
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,120
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

88
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,910
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

89
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm not leaving.

90
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,920
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

91
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,010
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

92
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,560
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

93
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,770
This is all your doing.

94
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,730
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

95
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,690
Don't call me again.

96
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,320
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

97
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,620
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

98
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,200
that's killed innocent people.

99
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,370
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

100
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,170
Are you threatening me?

101
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,380
Yes, I'm threatening you.

102
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,060
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

103
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,430
What do you want?

104
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,230
You're a cop.

105
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

106
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,190
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes'.

107
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,490
Arrest them.

108
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,370
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

109
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,250
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

110
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,630
We'll do it my way.

111
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,600
So you want Judy to be a rat?

112
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,350
I don't agree with this, Javier.

113
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,850
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

114
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,860
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

115
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,240
Fuck your honor.

116
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,160
Says you.

117
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,870
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

118
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,000
And what have you done?

119
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,750
If you have a better idea, go for it.

120
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,380
Otherwise, this is the deal.

121
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,880
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

122
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,300
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

123
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,270
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

124
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,810
We haven't heard anything from him
for weeks.

125
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,440
We don't even know where he is.

126
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,150
I don't know why you're letting
De Greiff come here.

127
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,110
He's coming to scare you.

128
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,240
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

129
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,500
You don't understand, do you?

130
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,920
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

131
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,880
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

132
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,510
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

133
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,010
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

134
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,220
They're going to give us their money?

135
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,310
No one is going to help us.

136
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,650
Everyone knows what that would mean.

137
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
Whatever he's doing...

138
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,750
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

139
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,500
Don't forget that.

140
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,370
Pablo? Can you hear me, Pablo?
Please answer.

141
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,430
Tata, can you hear me?

142
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,680
Tata?

143
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,640
Can you hear me?

144
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,680
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

145
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,520
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

146
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,810
Our donation to them is an advance.

147
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,480
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

148
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,280
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

149
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,320
What a fucking joke,

150
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,660
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

151
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,540
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

152
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,710
What? Any news about Judy?

153
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,630
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

154
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,180
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

155
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,470
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

156
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

157
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,060
Don Berna. Him we found.

158
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,020
Where?

159
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,940
Here.

160
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,320
Out front.

161
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,000
Don Berna!

162
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,420
Welcome to Cali.

163
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,260
Gilbert, thank you, brother.

164
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,170
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

165
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,140
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

166
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,220
Very well, brother.

167
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,520
It's about Judy.

168
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,630
Thanks. You won't regret it.

169
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,730
Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?

170
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,840
Tata, are you there?

171
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,600
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

172
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,980
Why don't you come drink with us?

173
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,360
I'll be right there.

174
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,420
There's coffee in the Thermos.

175
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,240
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

176
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,220
What do you want, Lugo? Money? Visa?

177
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,940
No visa, no money, you understand?

178
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,530
Is that what he thinks? That everyone
wants to go to the United States?

179
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,570
I don't want anything.

180
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,320
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

181
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,790
Find him and kill him.

182
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,620
What are you doing, Pablo?

183
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,580
You don't know how to tie a knot.

184
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,050
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

185
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,590
Wanted. Pablo Escobar.
Reward: 2,700,000,000 pesos.

186
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,100
Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

187
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,180
In Bogotá, 22-50-12.
In Medellín 61-11-11.

188
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,460
The kids would love to be here.

189
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,920
I've been thinking...

190
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,760
I could buy some land here next to you.

191
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,890
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

192
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,310
And have my own farm.

193
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,540
We could run it together.

194
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,760
What do you think?

195
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,270
We need to finish putting up the wire.

196
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,210
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

197
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,210
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

198
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,100
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

199
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,890
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

200
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,610
You are a survivor.

201
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,280
A man of action.

202
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,610
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

203
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,330
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

204
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,450
Sit.

205
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,920
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

206
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,710
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

207
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,030
The codes are the same ones
that Escobar's wife is using.

208
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,180
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

209
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Did you hear him?

210
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,050
No, Colonel, not yet.

211
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,230
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

212
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,440
I wasn't paying that much attention.

213
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,740
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

214
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,490
So, what do you think?

215
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,000
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

216
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,840
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

217
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,140
Now hold on to the pig.

218
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,230
Funny that you don't like blood.

219
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,480
How strange.

220
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,320
What are you trying to say?

221
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,410
Clean yourself.

222
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,670
You know what's funny?

223
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,300
That my dad...

224
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,440
has no fucking idea who I am.

225
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,150
I know very well who you are.

226
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,280
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

227
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,530
Is that right?

228
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,790
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

229
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,460
The United States? Disgusting.

230
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,250
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

231
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,800
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

232
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,010
- So what? So what?
- So what?!

233
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,890
And what about you? What about you?!

234
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,230
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

235
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,110
On this shithole farm.

236
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,870
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

237
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,040
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

238
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,380
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

239
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,960
That's right.

240
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
Now tell me...

241
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,770
Tell me...

242
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,230
what you think of me.

243
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,530
- Who cares?
- I do.

244
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,110
It's important to me.

245
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,160
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

246
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,460
But that's not possible, Pablo.

247
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,380
You chose your life!

248
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,840
Be in charge of it.

249
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,220
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

250
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,220
I'm ashamed.

251
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,860
I think you're a murderer.

252
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,950
At last, the truth.

253
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,700
At last, the truth.

254
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,910
A truth...

255
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,040
that breaks my heart.

256
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,890
Leave me alone.

257
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,800
Limón.

258
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,840
Yes, sir?

259
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,060
You like it here, right?

260
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,730
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

261
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,860
Peaceful.

262
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,820
Kneel down.

263
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,670
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

264
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,640
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

265
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,010
Go get it.

266
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,350
Are we leaving, boss?

267
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,730
Yes.

268
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,890
Go on.

269
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,960
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

270
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,550
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

271
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,880
Do you not realize that if we leave here,
they're going to kill us?

272
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:11,720
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

273
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,270
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

274
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,770
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

275
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,150
You're sorry?

276
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,650
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

277
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,700
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But--

278
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,740
But you can't help us find asylum.

279
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,540
That's bullshit!

280
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,380
They're going to... kill us all.

281
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,470
Mama, what's wrong?

282
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,970
Nothing, my love.

283
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

284
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,860
but I don't know what else to do.

285
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,040
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

286
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,040
Tell him to surrender.

287
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,630
The power of the law is your last hope.

288
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Think about your children.

289
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,930
Shit.

290
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,720
Yes, before you go to sleep.
Do you like it? Yes?

291
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,640
Fuck.

292
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,720
Jhon. What are you doing here?

293
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,820
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

294
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,530
We spent it. It's gone.

295
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,450
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

296
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,290
You've already hurt me.

297
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,420
You fucked up my life.

298
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,590
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

299
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,600
Hang on, Maritza.

300
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,490
And this?

301
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,620
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

302
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,960
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

303
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,710
You lying... bitch! Get off!

304
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,590
Motherfucker! Bastard!

305
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,430
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

306
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,600
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

307
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,480
What did you say?

308
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,190
Are you going to say something?
Are you going to rat on me?

309
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,690
I might! Why shouldn't I?

310
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,490
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero?

311
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,910
Jhon!

312
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,330
I know you! Get that shit out--

313
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,100
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

314
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,190
But I have bad news.

315
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,310
- What happened?
- Look.

316
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,570
It's rotten, sir.

317
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,590
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

318
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,730
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

319
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,310
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

320
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,910
Get your things. We're leaving.

321
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,620
Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

322
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,000
Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

323
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
Where?

324
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,210
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

325
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,170
We've used it before.

326
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,880
Berna knows where.

327
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,090
I'll see you there.

328
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,910
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

329
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,740
Let's go, Flaco.

330
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,550
I know what you're thinking.

331
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,520
I'm making a mistake.

332
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,810
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

333
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,360
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

334
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,610
Up here, Flaco.

335
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,380
I can't protect a rat.

336
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,020
I didn't think you'd betray me.

337
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,610
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

338
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,280
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

339
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,280
And if I don't, what? What happens?

340
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,330
If you don't get in,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

341
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,450
And I won't protect you anymore.

342
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,240
Tell me something.

343
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,570
Did Cali arrange this?

344
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,580
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

345
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,710
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

346
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,210
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

347
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,050
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

348
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,840
I only protected your life.

349
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,890
Relax. You'll have money.

350
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,230
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

351
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,980
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

352
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,530
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

353
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,830
Don't worry about a thing.

354
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:50,210
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

355
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,610
Tata?

356
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,410
Tata, can you hear me?

357
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,540
Pablo?

358
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,960
It's me, my love.

359
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,050
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

360
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,300
I've missed you so much.

361
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,010
Where have you been, Pablo?

362
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,100
I had to do something very important.

363
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,520
But I'm back home, my love.

364
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,650
I'm home.
