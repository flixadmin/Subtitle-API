1
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,650
Asgard's forces are upon us.

2
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,675
Send in the Kursed!

3
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,632
Their deaths will mean our survival.

4
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,087
This war is far from over.

5
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,787
The Aether awakens us.

6
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,423
The Convergence returns.

7
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,515
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

8
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,720
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

9
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,645
Our survival will be your legacy.

10
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,275
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

11
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,606
I will reclaim the Aether

12
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,941
I will restore our world

13
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,742
and I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

14
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,952
The worlds are nearly aligned.

15
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,125
You will be the last of the Kursed.

16
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,920
Let my life be sacrificed.

17
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,598
It is no less than our people did,

18
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,429
or you have done.

19
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,193
You will become darkness.

20
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,115
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

21
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,242
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

22
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:16,131
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

23
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,005
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether

24
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,101
and when you wake,
we will kill them all.

25
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,383
We must strike now

26
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,430
No

27
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:28,677
Asgard is meaningless.

28
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,811
The Aether has found its way home.

29
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,737
He is an enemy of Asgard.

30
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,574
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
