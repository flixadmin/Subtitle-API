1
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,480
People will say I am a monster...

2
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,348
...for what I've done.

3
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,884
And maybe they're right.

4
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,489
I always thought that I'd have more...

5
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,724
-...time.
-Dad?

6
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,526
Dad!

7
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,727
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,630
Peter?

9
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,847
He likes to sleep with the light on
at night.

10
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,649
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,587
Dad.

12
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,159
Be good.

13
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,205
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,642
-Are you uploading it?
-To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,544
Just in case we....

16
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,947
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,683
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,585
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,621
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,458
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,595
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,597
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,666
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,770
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,886
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,255
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,490
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,527
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,334
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,436
Something you need?

31
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,671
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,909
I'd just like to radio ahead and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

33
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,715
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

34
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,599
-Richard.
-They say you're a genius.

35
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,767
Richard!

36
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,371
-Not if you thought you could escape.
-Richard!

37
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,007
Mary!

38
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,422
Mary!

39
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,534
Mare.

40
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,003
It's okay. It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

41
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,540
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

42
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,042
Just gonna make you safe.

43
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,811
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

44
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,714
-Roosevelt.
-What?

45
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,982
Roosevelt.

46
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,560
It's back up. It's back up.

47
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,330
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

48
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,699
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

49
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,131
What do you got for me today,
New York?

50
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,166
Reporting live
from New York 1 chopper.

51
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,837
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

52
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,872
A police chase is in progress.

53
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,574
All right. Let's get to work.

54
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,747
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

55
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,079
Spider-Man!

56
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,914
Hello, pedestrians.

57
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,800
Knock, knock.

58
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,802
Mr. Criminal?

59
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,740
My name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing...

60
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,242
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

61
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,712
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

62
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,248
-I am killer!
-Whoa, okay.

63
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,552
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...

64
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,220
...and is highly explosive.

65
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:15,955
Excuse me.

66
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,324
There's more room on the sidewalk,
folks, please.

67
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,560
-Watch it, man.
-I got blueprints here.

68
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,794
A little help?

69
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,096
A little help, please.

70
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,569
Having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

71
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,103
Coming through.

72
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,574
Too much work....

73
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,143
Oh, this is bad.

74
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,711
I'm gonna be right back.

75
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,150
Heads up. Watch out.

76
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,788
Okay. Okay. There you go.

77
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,791
-You okay? You all right?
-You're Spider-Man.

78
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,226
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important.

79
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,295
"Max"? How do you know my name?

80
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,830
It's written on your badge.

81
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,031
I'm a nobody.

82
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,601
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

83
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,003
Lick that. All right. Listen to me.

84
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,638
-Now I need you.
-Really?

85
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,006
-You're my eyes and ears out here.
-Okay.

86
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,140
-All right?
-All right.

87
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,642
I'll see you out there.

88
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,846
Warning. Violation of protocol.

89
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,678
Hands up!

90
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,884
Get him, Spidey!

91
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,056
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

92
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,728
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

93
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,897
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

94
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,934
Get the hell out of the way!

95
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,870
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

96
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,306
Oh, come on.

97
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,443
Hey, wait. Come back here.

98
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,679
Heel!

99
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,148
I got you.

100
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,829
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

101
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,031
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

102
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,466
-I know, I'm sorry.
-Where are you?

103
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,301
1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

104
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,170
Five minutes. Ten tops.

105
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,139
-Are those sirens?
-No.

106
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,374
-Peter?
-No.

107
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,176
-Peter?
-No sirens.

108
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,911
No--

109
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,746
Peter.

110
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,381
What is happening?

111
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,882
Peter.

112
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,350
Peter.

113
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,790
Hello?

114
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,161
-Peter? Pe--
-I'll be right there. Promise.

115
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:13,899
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

116
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,049
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

117
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,151
...and families of my fellow graduates.

118
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,520
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

119
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,862
Hello.

120
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,396
-Hey! Get off!
-I told you.

121
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,432
I am running a bit late.

122
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,300
It's over, Spider.

123
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,502
Really?!

124
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,871
I know we all think that we're immortal.

125
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,772
We're supposed to feel that way.

126
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,040
We're graduating.

127
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,978
But, like our brief four years
in high school...

128
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,380
...what makes life valuable...

129
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,883
...is that it doesn't last forever.

130
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,418
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

131
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,022
And I know that now more than ever.

132
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,491
And I say it...

133
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,294
...today of all days...

134
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,197
...to remind us that time is luck.

135
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,437
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

136
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,374
Make yours count for something.

137
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,876
Fight for what matters to you.

138
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,278
No matter what.

139
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,980
Because even if we fall short...

140
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,983
...what better way is there to live?

141
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,464
I'll take that. That's not yours.

142
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,441
This is not end, Spider!

143
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,080
Michael Oates.

144
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,351
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

145
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,056
Alexis Ortiz.

146
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,028
Bo Parisi.

147
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,099
Peter Parker.

148
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,401
Hey, I think I know that guy.

149
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,936
Peter Park--

150
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,574
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,354
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

152
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:54,093
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

153
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,663
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, this is for you.

154
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,899
-I am so proud of you.
-You earned it.

155
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,134
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

156
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,004
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

157
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,205
Yeah, I know too.

158
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,508
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

159
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,979
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

160
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,381
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

161
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,216
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

162
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,385
Ben told me he made it up.

163
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,255
You really did learn something here.

164
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,694
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

165
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,231
Yeah, me too.

166
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,366
And my folks.

167
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,336
Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,174
-Would've been good.
-Perfect d--

169
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,977
All right, you can go. Go on.

170
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,178
I'll be right back.

171
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,048
-Is that your program?
-Guys. Get together right now.

172
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,951
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

173
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,619
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

174
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,956
-Okay. I'll just be over here.
-Yeah, just give me two seconds.

175
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,058
-Don't go too far.
-It's good to see you.

176
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,392
-All right.
-All right.

177
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,294
Hey.

178
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,497
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

179
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,669
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

180
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,072
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

181
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,007
-Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
-Yes?

182
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,141
Okay.

183
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,243
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

184
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,245
Can't keep me away.

185
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,714
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

186
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,282
-I won't be.
-Okay.

187
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,753
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

188
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,322
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

189
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,558
-Over and over again, all night long.
-Okay.

190
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,493
-Oh, my gosh.
-It was pretty good.

191
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,663
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

192
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:43,502
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

193
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,571
Hi.

194
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,242
You're gonna make enemies.

195
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,277
People will get hurt.

196
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,215
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

197
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,319
Leave Gwen out of it.

198
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,123
Promise me that.

199
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,092
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

200
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,241
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

201
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,211
What are you doing? What are you...?

202
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,581
Peter.

203
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,719
What is it?

204
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,356
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

205
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,624
Are you all right?

206
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,325
I don't know what I'm doing.

207
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,463
It's my father, isn't it?

208
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,198
Yeah.

209
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,434
I see him everywhere I go.

210
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,272
I can't-- I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

211
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,308
-Yeah, but we've talked about this.
-I know, but, Gwen--

212
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,410
-It's not his choice.
-Gwen.

213
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,548
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

214
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,751
And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner
with your family.

215
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,254
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

216
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,657
I don't know, what does that make you?

217
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,359
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

218
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,266
-I thought that it meant you loved me.
-I do love you.

219
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,570
I love you.

220
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,140
Then why isn't that enough?

221
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,810
Because what if
something happens to you...

222
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,613
...just like it happened to him
because of me?

223
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,150
-No, wait, wait, wait.
-Listen. No, n--

224
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,885
I cannot let that happen.

225
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,787
Listen to me.

226
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,722
You're Spider-Man...

227
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,558
...and I love that.

228
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,196
But I love Peter Parker more.

229
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,701
That's worth it to me.

230
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,770
I can't lose you too.

231
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:03,709
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

232
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,380
...who does that work out for, Peter?

233
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,718
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

234
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,159
You have done this to me...

235
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,730
...again and again, Peter.

236
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,332
I can't live like this.

237
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,403
I break up with you.

238
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,807
I break up with you.

239
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,382
Good morning, New Yorkers.

240
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,785
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

241
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,620
A few clouds to start us off....

242
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,923
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...

243
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,693
...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

244
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,328
How about that Spider-Man?

245
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,231
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

246
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,732
We wanna hear your calls.

247
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,868
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

248
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,272
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

249
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,640
It's you and me, taxpayers.

250
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,475
-You make this?
-Yeah.

251
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,577
This is a wind turbine.

252
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,313
You made this? No way.

253
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,848
This is amazing.

254
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,018
It's good as new, right?

255
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,720
I'll walk you home.

256
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,755
-What's your name?
-Jorge.

257
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,324
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

258
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,461
I don't feel like my kids are safe
with him out there.

259
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,530
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

260
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,835
Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.

261
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,404
What do you think?

262
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,339
One guy or many?

263
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,409
I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

264
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,610
Hey.

265
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,911
-Nice outfit.
-Thanks.

266
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,415
We have a caller on the line named
Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

267
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,752
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

268
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,321
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

269
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,656
He saved my life one time.

270
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,725
We sort of became best friends.

271
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,461
How much?

272
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,331
-Hey, you're that spider guy.
-I'm Spider-Man.

273
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,004
I'm Spider-Man.

274
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,908
This Spider-Man.... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

275
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,345
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

276
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,444
Peter, honey?

277
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,612
Can I come in?

278
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,582
No!

279
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,818
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

280
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,087
You said you would take my car
into the shop...

281
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,855
...because it keeps dying.

282
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,991
Give me a second. I'm gonna get
the door. Just give me a second.

283
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,428
-Peter, please just let me in. All right?
-I'm trying to get my--

284
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,798
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

285
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,701
-No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
-What are you do--?

286
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,437
Peter! For goodness sakes.

287
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,607
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee--!

288
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,777
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

289
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,078
I'm just--

290
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,913
I'm very naked right now.

291
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,483
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

292
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,752
-It is?
-Yes.

293
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,788
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

294
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,857
We have no chimney.

295
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,492
What?

296
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,060
-You're late.
-I know, I'm late.

297
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,962
Downstairs, now.

298
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,965
-Can you leave? Because I'm naked.
-All right, I'm leaving.

299
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,668
-Morning, I love you.
-l love you too. Hurry up.

300
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,945
Well, look who's here.

301
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,480
Spidey.

302
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,148
How was your morning?

303
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,617
Aces, Max, aces.

304
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,820
I've been out saving the world.

305
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,488
Protecting everybody.

306
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,491
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

307
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,928
That's why you're here.

308
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,063
You remembered my birthday.

309
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,001
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

310
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,805
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to--

311
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,842
But of course you would.

312
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,643
Why wouldn't you visit me?

313
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,712
We're best friends.

314
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,985
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

315
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,989
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

316
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,925
I know what they say about you in
the press but it doesn't matter to me.

317
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,761
I know the real you.
Because you're amazing.

318
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,965
That's what the press needs.

319
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,034
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

320
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,103
You like that, Spidey?

321
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,239
I like it a lot, Max.

322
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,175
Good. Because today...

323
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,010
...is going to be...

324
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,211
...amazing.

325
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,015
Yeah. Circuit 39.

326
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,922
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

327
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,092
I just wanna know if you can find
another waitress...

328
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,029
...to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

329
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,865
Don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

330
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,300
Because he'll worry.

331
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,003
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

332
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,838
Double shift on Thursday.

333
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,640
Okay, bye.

334
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,044
-Who was that?
-Harvey.

335
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,282
-Doing a double shift, huh?
-Sometimes.

336
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,884
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

337
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,588
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

338
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,927
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

339
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,196
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

340
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,965
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

341
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,634
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

342
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,171
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

343
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,573
-I'm doing my laundry.
-No, I do the laundry.

344
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,177
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

345
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,146
I understand that. I'm in college now.

346
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,082
It's time that I took care
of my own dirty underwear.

347
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,851
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

348
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,653
-...so no.
-That was a mistake.

349
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,256
Because I was washing
the American flag.

350
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,225
-My-- Can I please just--?
-No one washes a flag.

351
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,894
I do, and I won't anymore.

352
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,096
-This is my machine.
-It's just underwear.

353
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,832
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

354
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,267
Back off, eat your breakfast.

355
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,172
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

356
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,840
-I'll do it.
-No, forget it.

357
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,909
-Give it to me.
-I'll do it some other time.

358
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,378
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

359
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,846
Jerk.

360
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,949
Not gonna make it.

361
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,688
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

362
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,791
-Watch it, buddy.
-Hey, let's go.

363
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,897
Oscorp Industries...

364
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,635
...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

365
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:22,107
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...

366
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,910
...we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy...

367
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,680
...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...

368
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,116
...and eventually the world
for generations to come.

369
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,185
-Dillon. You're late.
-Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

370
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,388
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible...

371
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,690
...for the entire city's energy supply?

372
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,092
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

373
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,328
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

374
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,697
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

375
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,032
You designed them?

376
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,334
Sure you did.

377
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,136
And I'm Spider-Man.

378
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,372
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

379
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,876
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna rip
your well-groomed head off!

380
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,045
Now, get to work.

381
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,415
What floor, please?

382
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,051
-Seventy-four.
-Thank you.

383
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,685
Oh, hold that!

384
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,055
-Can you hold that, please?
-I got it.

385
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,223
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

386
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,259
Most people would have
let those close.

387
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,294
Most people don't notice other people.

388
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,863
-What floor, please?
-Sixty-three--

389
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,732
I got it. I got it. What is it?

390
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:21,966
Sixty-three.

391
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,069
Sixty-three, please.

392
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,303
-Thank you.
-In a hurry.

393
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,872
Thank you very much.

394
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,912
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

395
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,380
I'm Gwen.

396
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,415
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

397
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,984
Is it your birthday?

398
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,156
Oh, yeah. Well, I-- They--
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

399
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,993
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club. A lot of celebrities.

400
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,230
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

401
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,800
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

402
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,502
-...dressed as Spider-Man...
-That's exciting.

403
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,137
...hanging out near the blaze.

404
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,874
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

405
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,244
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

406
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,314
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

407
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,515
...me.

408
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,417
He said he needed me.

409
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,820
That must be a good feeling.

410
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,256
Sixty-third floor.

411
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,859
It was nice to meet you, Max.

412
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,430
Wait. She remembered my name.

413
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,182
Welcome home.

414
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,529
It's dark in there.

415
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,998
Your eyes will adjust.

416
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,134
It's better this way.

417
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,431
Dad.

418
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,174
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

419
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,244
Looking at my son...

420
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,513
...and seeing a stranger.

421
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,451
You have such potential, Harry.

422
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,388
Such fierce intelligence...

423
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,457
...and you're throwing it all away.

424
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,860
No, you threw me away.

425
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,198
You kicked me off to boarding school
when I was 11.

426
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,035
On my 16th birthday...

427
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,004
...you sent me Scotch.

428
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,273
Or one of your assistants did.

429
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,343
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

430
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,047
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

431
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,017
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

432
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,619
...anymore.

433
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,489
I don't believe in miracles.

434
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,459
How could you possibly understand...

435
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,496
...that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

436
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,498
...for something greater?

437
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,234
And not just for me.

438
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,969
For you!

439
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,141
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

440
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,580
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming...

441
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,616
...hiding under your skin...

442
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,086
...waiting to show itself.

443
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,555
To show you...

444
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,592
...who you really are.

445
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,432
Retroviral hyperplasia.

446
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,670
I never told you...

447
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,073
...that it's genetic.

448
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,610
Our disease...

449
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,080
...the Osborn curse.

450
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,383
And it began at your age.

451
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,219
Let me see it.

452
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,290
Your hand. Give it to me.

453
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:50,668
The greatest inheritance
I can give you...

454
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,971
...isn't merely money.

455
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,172
It's this.

456
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,309
The sum total of all my work.

457
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,480
Everything I did to stay alive.

458
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,249
Maybe you can succeed...

459
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,452
...where I failed.

460
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,613
Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died...

461
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,548
...the Osborn estate has confirmed.

462
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,184
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn...

463
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,254
...who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

464
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,622
Harry.

465
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,192
Osborn changed the medical profession's
approach to human healing...

466
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,695
...and affected the lives of millions.

467
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,466
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

468
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,236
"We can do better.
And we should do better."

469
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:03,741
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

470
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,544
But change isn't just a slogan.

471
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,646
It begins with hard work.

472
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,383
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

473
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,187
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

474
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,591
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

475
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,527
But not today.

476
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,629
Today is for mourning.

477
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,131
-Hello?
-Is this Gwen Stacy?

478
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,433
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

479
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,503
I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.

480
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,710
-Dillon. You stay here.
-What?

481
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,747
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Take a look.

482
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,317
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

483
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,286
-Because you're special.
-Smythe.

484
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,787
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

485
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,622
Happy birthday.

486
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,728
Bioelectrogenesis:

487
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,766
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off--

488
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,202
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

489
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,472
-The genetically manipulated--
-At least somebody's partying.

490
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,341
All right. Just a little sick.

491
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,811
I got your medicine, though.

492
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,783
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

493
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,518
Designed the grid....

494
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,553
-Warning:
-I should've stretched.

495
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,556
-Malfunction in Sector 5A.
-I know. Just a little indigestion.

496
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,426
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

497
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,528
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday"
for me?

498
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,697
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

499
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,298
-Gilbert?
-What?

500
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,902
It's Max. Can we shut down power
on Sector 32, please?

501
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,537
Forget it. I'm out the door.

502
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,739
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

503
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,907
-Sorry, Max.
-Hello?

504
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,779
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

505
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,748
This is crazy.

506
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,875
System restored.

507
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,577
Have a nice day.

508
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,614
Harry, Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

509
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,950
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

510
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,418
...breach of trust.

511
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,253
You mean people are pissed off...

512
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,690
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

513
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,626
Given that...

514
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,363
...all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed...

515
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,765
...to restore investor confidence.

516
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,636
That is the Osborn way.

517
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,506
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

518
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,310
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

519
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,614
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

520
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,616
Sure, sure. I get it.

521
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,018
Twenty-year-old kid.

522
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,953
Two hundred billion dollar company.

523
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,822
What was Dad thinking?

524
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,625
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

525
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,364
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

526
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,734
Someone must've thought about
having him declared legally incompetent.

527
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,036
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

528
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,672
-Harry--
-It's Mr. Osborn.

529
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,975
We're not friends.

530
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,749
Hi.

531
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,555
You were his assistant, right?

532
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,527
What's your name?

533
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,462
Felicia.

534
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,797
Felicia.

535
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,666
From now on...

536
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,703
...everybody at this table
works for Felicia...

537
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,540
...because Felicia works for me.

538
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,810
Would anybody like to speak up?

539
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,516
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

540
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,020
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

541
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,565
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

542
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,768
Every single one.

543
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,811
Peter Parker.

544
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,114
It's like seeing a ghost.

545
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,717
Hey, Harry.

546
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,752
Random.

547
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,621
-What, 10 years.
-It's eight.

548
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,091
But you're close.

549
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,560
What's up?

550
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,829
I saw the news, man.

551
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,399
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and--

552
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,603
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

553
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,406
I'm with some people.

554
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,010
I'm in a....

555
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,846
I'm in a meeting.

556
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,714
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

557
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,516
I know it's been a long time.

558
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,753
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

559
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,622
And you were so there for me
when my parents....

560
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,892
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

561
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,761
Thank you.

562
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,831
It's good to see you, man.

563
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,602
It's good to see you.

564
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,438
I'm sorry about your dad.

565
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,543
You got your braces off.

566
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,850
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

567
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,755
There he is.

568
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,757
There he is.

569
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,794
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

570
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,732
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

571
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,767
...but I work the comb, okay?

572
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,971
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

573
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,174
You're stupid.

574
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,082
After graduation, I went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

575
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,651
-That's right, yeah.
-Yeah.

576
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,786
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

577
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,987
I saw you.

578
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,889
What do you mean, you saw me?

579
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,792
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

580
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,962
-You know what I'm talking about?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,199
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

582
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,867
I know.

583
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,204
What?

584
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,573
You got a lady?

585
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,846
That's a question.

586
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,482
That's a question.

587
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,883
Whoa, buddy.

588
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,552
No, I don't.

589
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,688
Yeah.

590
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,057
I don't know. It's....

591
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,562
I don't know. It's complicated.

592
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,631
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

593
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,603
What's her name? Who is she?

594
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,904
Her name's Gwen.

595
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,839
Gwen Stacy.

596
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,243
-Gwen Stacy.
-She works for you.

597
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,011
Really? She works for me?

598
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,648
-She does work-study at Oscorp.
-Is she a model employee?

599
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,819
When my father sent me away...

600
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,922
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

601
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,260
I guess that kind of included you.

602
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,965
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

603
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,202
We both got dumped.

604
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,208
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

605
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,014
My dad left a briefcase.

606
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,017
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

607
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,719
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

608
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,688
How's that working out for you?

609
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,723
Perfectly.

610
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,032
Dude. Nice arm.

611
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,935
It's just the wrist.
It's all in the wrist, buddy.

612
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,771
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

613
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,905
Yeah, right.

614
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,709
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

615
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,978
Giant lizards...

616
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,581
...and spider guys.

617
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,319
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

618
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,956
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

619
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,226
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

620
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,696
I'm so impressed.

621
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,965
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

622
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,866
For what?

623
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,836
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

624
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,372
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

625
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,811
Who was he?

626
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,814
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

627
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,817
No associates or friends to speak of.

628
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,287
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

629
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,788
The guy was...

630
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,757
...invisible.

631
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,629
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

632
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,831
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

633
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,736
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

634
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,806
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

635
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,311
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

636
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,712
Hey.

637
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,208
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

638
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,890
Hey. Hi.

639
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:02,926
Hi.

640
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,362
You look amazing.

641
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,101
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of....

642
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,871
No. I don't-- I-- Spontaneous...

643
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,173
...is all right. You know.

644
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,942
Well, I just figured it was time.

645
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,211
You know?

646
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,347
Time that we try to be friends.

647
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,949
Yeah.

648
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,154
Friends, yeah. That's...

649
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,256
...great.

650
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,858
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

651
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,528
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

652
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,062
Keep it simple.

653
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,033
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

654
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,434
Well, I mean....

655
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:51,542
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

656
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,144
-Some ground rules?
-Yeah, some ground rules.

657
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,846
Like that.

658
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,214
Like what?

659
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,817
-That laugh. That laugh.
-What?

660
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,452
That's off the table.

661
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,855
-My laugh is off the table?
-Off the table.

662
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,057
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

663
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,195
That's still adorable.

664
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,997
-That was not adorable.
-It's adorable.

665
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,365
No, it's not adorable.

666
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,302
-Okay. I have a ground rule.
-Oh, good.

667
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,903
What is it?

668
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,606
Don't tell me that I look amazing...

669
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,044
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

670
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,080
I'm really serious about that one.

671
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,250
-Oh, no.
-What?

672
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,285
I just figured out the next ground rule.

673
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,620
What?

674
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,422
No more of this.

675
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,591
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

676
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,459
-This?
-Don't think I haven't-- Hey.

677
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,429
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

678
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,164
This is killing me.

679
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,967
You're spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

680
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,368
Come on.

681
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,372
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

682
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,445
Yeah. So I did that.

683
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:40,550
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

684
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,487
-Yeah. No, I know.
-Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

685
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,223
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

686
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,560
How do you know that?

687
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,465
How do you know I love it there?

688
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,434
Because....

689
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,338
Because you told me.

690
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,576
It just opened last month.

691
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,249
Have you been following me?

692
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,122
I knew it.

693
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,024
How often?

694
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,096
Just once a day.

695
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,564
Sometimes.

696
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,635
Sometimes more.

697
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,741
Oh, boy.

698
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,343
Why?

699
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,415
Make sure I'm safe?

700
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,185
-And....
-And what?

701
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,722
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

702
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,203
I'm moving to England.

703
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,712
What?

704
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,681
Yeah.

705
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,718
I have a--
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

706
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,022
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

707
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,225
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

708
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,228
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

709
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,330
And-- And it's-- It could be him.

710
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,365
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

711
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,802
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

712
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,172
Yeah.

713
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,174
And I'm really excited.

714
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,777
That's....

715
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,448
England.

716
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,585
What?

717
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,144
Station, I need a 10-85.

718
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,347
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

719
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,349
Folks, could you step to the side?

720
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,751
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

721
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,655
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

722
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,792
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

723
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,161
Let me see your hands, please!

724
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,565
You stay right where you are!
Do not move!

725
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,868
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

726
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,487
Get down on the ground, now!

727
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,390
-Stop!
-Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

728
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,225
-It's not my fault!
-Sir!

729
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,827
-Stop!
-I'm gonna need for you...

730
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,396
-Please!
-...to get down on the ground, now!

731
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,699
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

732
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,270
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,307
They see me. You see me.

734
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,710
You see me.

735
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,779
They see me.

736
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,826
-No! No! Stop!
-On the ground now!

737
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,729
-Don't do that. Please!
-It's over, freak!

738
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,567
Wait! It's not my fault.
It's not my fault!

739
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:27,871
I said stop!

740
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,546
I'm glad you're not one of those cops
that rides a horse.

741
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,923
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

742
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,330
All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

743
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,367
Stop. Stop it.

744
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,668
Yo, Sparkles!

745
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,605
Hey, how you doing?

746
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:05,008
-It's you?
-Yeah, I know it's me.

747
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,543
Who are you?

748
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,346
You don't remember me?

749
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:11,648
No. Should I?

750
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,685
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

751
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,420
You saved me.

752
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,356
You said you needed me.

753
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,292
-You're the guy with the blueprints.
-Yes.

754
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,660
Blueprints.

755
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,765
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

756
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:31,801
-What's your name again?
-How could you forget me?

757
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,537
-I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
-It's Max.

758
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,573
-Is it "Max"?
-Yes.

759
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,708
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
with the--

760
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,644
You look different.

761
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,412
How are you?

762
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,481
I don't know what's going on with me.

763
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,716
I can see that. I can-- I believe you.

764
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:52,355
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much....

765
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,491
I got so much anger.

766
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,794
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

767
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,963
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

768
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,998
I can see you don't want
to hurt anybody.

769
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,601
-It's gonna be all right.
-Clear shot. Standing by.

770
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,503
-I don't want them shooting me.
-They won't.

771
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,305
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

772
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,776
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

773
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,378
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

774
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,882
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

775
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,083
I just--

776
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,787
I just wanted everyone to see me.

777
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,922
He makes a move, you take that shot.

778
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,058
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

779
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,093
Away from all these people, okay?

780
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,795
Yeah, yes.

781
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,798
No! No! Stop!

782
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,002
Max!

783
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,390
Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!

784
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,960
You stupid freak!

785
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,868
Electro dummy!

786
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,044
Get out of here, you freak!

787
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,445
Shut up!

788
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,683
You're so selfish.

789
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:28,985
Stay with me, Max.

790
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,620
You set me up.

791
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,988
No, I didn't set you up.

792
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,790
You lied to me!

793
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,459
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

794
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:24,908
Are you all right?

795
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,449
It's my birthday.

796
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,617
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

797
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,731
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

798
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,167
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

799
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,881
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

800
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,583
-Mike.
-Yeah.

801
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:14,984
-Big John.
-Nice job.

802
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,719
Nice work, fellas.

803
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,756
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

804
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,165
Spider-Man.

805
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,906
England?

806
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,709
Really?

807
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,920
Good talk.

808
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,807
Our coverage of this breaking story...

809
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,676
...begins with New York 1's
Jessica Abo at the scene.

810
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,346
That's right. We're standing here
with two eyewitnesses...

811
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,348
...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.

812
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,383
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

813
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,118
How do you think
he beat this creature?

814
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,886
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized,
Spidey's suit.

815
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,722
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

816
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,157
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

817
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,059
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

818
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,729
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

819
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,665
We'll bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

820
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,967
Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.

821
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,745
Online polls show a sudden uptick...

822
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,247
...in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.

823
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,318
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

824
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,018
Next-generation military body armor.

825
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:13,222
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...

826
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,858
...direct nervous system interface.

827
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,036
So the common household spider...

828
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,504
...unlike human cells...

829
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,374
...theirs contain the power
to self-heal...

830
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,211
...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

831
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:40,082
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

832
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:45,188
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.

833
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,257
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

834
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,494
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

835
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,297
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

836
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,834
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

837
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,838
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

838
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,307
...the battery might explode!

839
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,175
Explode!

840
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,914
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

841
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,216
You're not invincible.

842
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,351
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

843
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,261
-Hello.
-Pete.

844
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,162
It's me.

845
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,131
Hey, Harry. What--?

846
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,967
What time is it?

847
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:09,005
Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

848
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,573
I need to see you.

849
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,141
You all right?

850
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,643
Not really, Pete.

851
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,411
I'm dying.

852
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,414
But I think you can help
save my life.

853
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:24,086
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

854
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,189
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands...

855
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,926
...and turn that into a cure.

856
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,595
An agent that heals diseased cells.

857
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:38,100
And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...

858
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,369
...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

859
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,043
They never made it to human trials.

860
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,013
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

861
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:55,384
Except maybe this.

862
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,094
Spider-Man.

863
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,296
What about him?

864
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,033
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

865
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:15,237
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

866
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:19,141
...but he can do everything else
a spider can...

867
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,444
...including self-heal.

868
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,412
I need to find him.

869
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:25,715
I need his blood.

870
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,631
You need...

871
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,035
...Spider-Man's blood?

872
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,540
It'll save my life.

873
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,010
It may not, Har.

874
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,479
It may not be that simple.

875
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,581
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

876
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,349
Connors was weak.

877
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,284
This is me, Peter.

878
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,553
I don't think you can just set up a van...

879
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,689
...and have him donate.

880
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:12,261
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about
people shoving needles and--

881
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,562
He's sensitive, okay.

882
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:18,768
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

883
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,404
...and I will go ask him myself.

884
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:22,805
What?

885
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,810
-You took his picture.
-So?

886
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,212
-You know him.
-Harry.

887
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,649
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

888
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,217
I don't know him.

889
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,056
I put together what you said
at the river.

890
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,293
-What I--
-About how he gives people hope.

891
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,630
Come on.

892
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,478
What in the--?

893
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,085
Just say yes.

894
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:17,760
Don't turn your back on me!

895
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,597
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

896
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,700
Please.

897
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,870
Peter, please.

898
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,572
I can't.

899
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,610
Please.

900
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,217
I'm gonna try...

901
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,619
...and find Spider-Man.

902
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,665
-Hey, what's security doing over here?
-That's so weird.

903
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,400
She's right over there.

904
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,675
Hey! Miss Stacy!

905
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:23,893
Hi.

906
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,494
Hi.

907
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,196
What are you doing here?

908
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,265
What are you doing here?

909
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,301
Come here.

910
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,910
She's not here. Check another floor.

911
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,611
-Got it.
-Yes, sir!

912
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:43,879
You're in trouble.

913
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,414
-Yeah.
-Who's that guy?

914
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,751
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

915
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,820
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

916
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,357
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

917
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:58,527
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

918
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:02,431
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of
a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

919
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:05,401
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

920
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,904
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

921
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,739
-My God.
-He's completely erased.

922
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:11,874
That's Oscorp.

923
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,411
-And what about you? Why are you here?
-Harry.

924
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,979
-Osborn?
-He's dying.

925
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,215
-What do you mean?
-He's dying.

926
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,917
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

927
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,486
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

928
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,456
And as far as I know,
if I give it to him, it could kill him.

929
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,291
Or something worse.

930
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:30,926
I know.

931
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,696
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

932
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,233
This is the most clichéd hiding place
you could've chosen.

933
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,568
-This is the stupidest hiding place.
-I'm sorry...

934
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:43,572
...I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

935
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:47,576
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't....

936
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,422
-You just kissed me.
-I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

937
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,458
How'd you like it?

938
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,326
It felt a little bit rushed.

939
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,629
I know. I know, I know.

940
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:10,633
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

941
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,434
Okay.

942
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,484
-God! Damn it!
-I'm so--

943
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,920
I just spilled a hot latte all over your--
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

944
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,922
And you too? I'm sorry.

945
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,724
-Miss! Stay right there!
-Sir.

946
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,327
-Just stay right--
-Wait, wait, wait.

947
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,528
Hey! Stop!

948
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:42,898
All right. On your way.

949
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,501
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

950
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,474
-Gwen Stacy.
-Oh, my God.

951
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,677
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

952
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,345
No, it's okay.

953
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,481
I'm-- I'm Harry.

954
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,050
Yeah.

955
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:05,554
-I'm an old friend of Peter's.
-Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

956
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,456
I was kind of rushing.

957
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,992
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

958
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,461
I thought you two had broken up.

959
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,633
Yeah. Yes, we had.

960
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,468
And it's....

961
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,570
-It's complicated.
-Complicated. Yeah.

962
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,940
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

963
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,342
Yeah.

964
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:27,976
Yeah.

965
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,112
Yeah, you're right.

966
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,581
But that's why he needs you.

967
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,451
Right?

968
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,988
To help him make his choices clear.

969
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:44,860
Nice to meet you, Harry.

970
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,063
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

971
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:47,022
You've been in a terrible accident.

972
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,426
I'm Dr. Kafka.

973
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,895
I'm here to help you.

974
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,863
Course you are, doc.

975
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:59,968
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

976
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,638
High-intensity capacitors.

977
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,007
The kind they make at Oscorp.

978
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,143
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

979
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,678
You are correct.

980
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,947
I'm here to study you.

981
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:16,885
To understand what you are,
why you are.

982
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,987
Und I will get results.

983
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,161
I always do.

984
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,499
You do realize...

985
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,835
...you locked me in a prison...

986
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,703
...that runs...

987
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,772
...on electricity?

988
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,877
I can feel it in the walls.

989
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,012
I can feel it in my veins.

990
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,649
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

991
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,118
It's a force of nature.

992
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:52,855
Like me.

993
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:01,830
You wanna know how powerful I am?

994
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,233
Well, so do I.

995
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,074
I'm dying to know...

996
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:13,942
...doc.

997
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,746
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

998
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,548
Because if you don't...

999
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,084
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1000
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:26,855
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1001
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,625
A world without power.

1002
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,127
A world without mercy.

1003
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:33,962
A world...

1004
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:35,864
...without Spider-Man.

1005
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,702
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1006
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:43,238
And who are you?

1007
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,240
Don't you know?

1008
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,142
I'm Electro.

1009
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,784
Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.

1010
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,787
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1011
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,689
Very impressive...

1012
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,191
...Electro.

1013
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,894
Lockdown initiated.

1014
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,075
Aunt May?

1015
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:26,882
What are you doing?

1016
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,784
When did you do this?

1017
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,896
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1018
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,099
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1019
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,970
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1020
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,138
-I don't lie.
-I know you love me, but you do.

1021
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,306
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1022
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,142
You have to tell me, May.

1023
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,311
That's my father.

1024
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,046
Yes, he was your father.

1025
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,949
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1026
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:02,851
...here.

1027
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,954
I need the truth.

1028
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,792
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1029
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,961
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1030
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,764
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1031
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:20,769
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1032
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,640
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1033
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,041
Your father?

1034
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,376
No.

1035
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:31,880
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1036
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,816
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1037
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:39,788
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1038
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,690
...who has to take nursing classes...

1039
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,793
...with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1040
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,062
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1041
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,363
I don't know how. And--

1042
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:52,334
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1043
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,270
...who was never here. No.

1044
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,040
No, I won't tell you.

1045
01:17:58,273 --> 01:17:59,341
You're my boy.

1046
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,010
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1047
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,278
And I won't hurt you.

1048
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,756
I'm your boy.

1049
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,758
You're my everything.

1050
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,329
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1051
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,066
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1052
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,969
-I love you so much.
-I know.

1053
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,142
It's okay.

1054
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,712
It's okay.

1055
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,816
May.

1056
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,054
I need to know.

1057
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:51,927
All right.

1058
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,299
I'll tell you everything I know.

1059
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,870
But it will hurt you.

1060
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,039
Okay.

1061
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,144
A few days after the funeral...

1062
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:13,148
...two government men came to see us.

1063
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:18,120
They said the genetics research...

1064
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,890
...that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1065
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,793
...and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1066
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,995
And that's why he ran off with it.

1067
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,964
They said he was a traitor.

1068
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,966
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1069
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:34,102
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1070
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,871
...for the money.

1071
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,173
I don't--

1072
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,044
I don't get it. No, I don't--
This doesn't make sense.

1073
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:46,948
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1074
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,350
It doesn't make any sense.

1075
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,918
Peter, I don't know.

1076
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,288
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1077
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,891
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1078
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,493
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1079
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,963
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1080
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,900
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1081
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,235
Came home at 6 every night.

1082
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,905
I don't know.

1083
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,542
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1084
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,179
Even from the people they love.

1085
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,486
Peter.

1086
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,124
Peter.

1087
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,563
Mr. Osborn.

1088
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:40,902
Look up.

1089
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,505
Think you're looking for me.

1090
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:48,443
I cannot believe my eyes.

1091
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,479
Spider-Man.

1092
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,922
Just the man I wanted to see.

1093
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,026
You...

1094
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:07,963
...talked to Peter?

1095
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:09,931
Yeah.

1096
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:19,174
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1097
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,945
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1098
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,247
Excuse me?

1099
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,016
It's too dangerous.

1100
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,219
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1101
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,422
I'm already dying.

1102
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,226
Your blood can't make me die more.

1103
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,228
But it could do something worse.

1104
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,165
Okay.

1105
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,469
All right, how much?

1106
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,105
-How much what?
-How much do you want? Name it.

1107
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:54,276
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1108
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:57,679
-I don't want your money.
-Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1109
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,547
I don't.

1110
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,318
I thought you....

1111
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,454
I thought you were supposed to
save people.

1112
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:11,226
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1113
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,662
You're-- You're just gonna let me die.

1114
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,232
-I'm trying to protect you right now.
-No. No, you are not.

1115
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,968
You're trying to protect yourself.

1116
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:24,606
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1117
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,409
-...to figure out something else.
-I do not have time!

1118
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,483
I'm sorry.

1119
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,962
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1120
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,378
-Hey! Hi.
-Hi.

1121
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,514
-Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
-I'm running late right now.

1122
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,384
-It's just gonna take a second.
-I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1123
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:13,021
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1124
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:15,190
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1125
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,059
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1126
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:20,695
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1127
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,098
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do
with Harry.

1128
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:24,532
Of course I wanna save him.

1129
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,735
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1130
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,504
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1131
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,306
I don't know. I got no idea.

1132
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,710
-Oh, God.
-I got nothing. I got nothing.

1133
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,713
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is....

1134
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,549
Ms. Stacy?

1135
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,385
Shall I take you upstairs?

1136
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,087
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1137
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:50,425
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1138
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,460
-Okay.
-Thank you. I'm sorry.

1139
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,797
-I'm-- Okay. I have to be--
-Where are we?

1140
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:57,499
I'm at my...

1141
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,036
...last interview for Oxford
right now.

1142
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,739
-Oxford. I didn't know.
-Yeah.

1143
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:07,375
Okay, well....

1144
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:09,477
I'm sorry to bother you...

1145
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,346
...my fair lady-- Madam.

1146
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,348
But who am I?

1147
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,183
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1148
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,419
I'm one of the young professors
at Harvard...

1149
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:20,588
...and I've been trying to get her
to be in my....

1150
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,558
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1151
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:26,694
And she's just the best person I know
and a scientific genius.

1152
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,096
And....

1153
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:29,631
Anyway, God save the queen.

1154
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,200
-I'm sorry everything's happening--
-Can you wait?

1155
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,468
Peter. Peter.

1156
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,336
What do you want to say to me?

1157
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,572
What's the "one thing"?

1158
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,511
I have to go to England, Peter.

1159
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:46,815
It's important to me.

1160
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,823
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1161
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,625
You know? I don't know.

1162
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,294
Maybe we're just...

1163
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,329
...going different ways. I don't--

1164
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,598
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1165
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,336
Gwen.

1166
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,140
Good luck.

1167
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,812
Hi. Sorry.

1168
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:21,442
He took the D train every morning
at 7 to work.

1169
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,479
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1170
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:33,888
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1171
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,591
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension...

1172
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,561
...of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square...

1173
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:43,464
...built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye...

1174
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:47,202
...to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1175
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:58,580
Mr. Osborn?

1176
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,482
You all right?

1177
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:04,285
Is there anything I can get you?

1178
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,488
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1179
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,257
Spiders?

1180
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,426
The ones that they destroyed...

1181
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,697
..."to restore investor confidence."

1182
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,866
Go home, Felicia.

1183
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,501
Take the day off.

1184
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,805
Harry.

1185
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:29,744
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1186
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,451
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1187
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,354
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1188
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,823
...they had the venom extracted.

1189
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,660
What?

1190
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,430
What are you saying?

1191
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:51,733
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1192
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:54,569
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1193
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:56,871
Where is it?

1194
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,007
It's somewhere in the building.

1195
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:04,045
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1196
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:07,915
Special Projects.

1197
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:09,651
Most recent entry:

1198
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:11,286
One hour ago.

1199
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:14,022
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1200
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,360
Accessing Ravencroft Archive.

1201
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,301
File 713.

1202
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,004
What the hell?

1203
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,007
File 71.

1204
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,576
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1205
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,378
And then I'm gonna kill the light...

1206
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:41,649
...so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1207
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,818
A world without power.

1208
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,386
A world...

1209
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,322
...without Spider-Man.

1210
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:48,856

He's busy.

1213
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:56,531
What did you do?

1214
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:59,067
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1215
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:03,504
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1216
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:08,009
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1217
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:12,046
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1218
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,382
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1219
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,718
Progress has its stepping stones.

1220
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:19,754
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been--

1221
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,622
How do I put this gently?

1222
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:22,824
--fired.

1223
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,127
You are not going to bury me too.

1224
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,063
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1225
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,599
It's only a matter of time.

1226
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:34,535
You're going to die a horrible death.

1227
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,537
Like your father.

1228
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,706
The difference is...

1229
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:40,975
...no one is going to miss you.

1230
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:45,012
Get him out.

1231
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:46,414
Wait. Wait.

1232
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,423
I know my way out.

1233
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,769
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1234
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,404
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1235
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:11,639
I tried. Good luck.

1236
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:14,675
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1237
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,054
Test.

1238
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:42,323
My name is Richard Parker.

1239
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,792
Whatever lies will be told about me...

1240
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:46,894
...I would like the world
to know the truth.

1241
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:51,065
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...

1242
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:56,137
...when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization...

1243
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:58,940
...to continue funding my research.

1244
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,642
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1245
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,278
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1246
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:05,947
So I refused.

1247
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:09,250
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture...

1248
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:13,354
...Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me...

1249
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:17,158
...in order to take control
of my work.

1250
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,963
Can I help you?

1251
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,598
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1252
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:26,033
I'm Harry Osborn.

1253
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:30,237
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1254
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:33,140
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1255
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:36,210
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1256
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:42,316
But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...

1257
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:45,186
...that Norman doesn't know.

1258
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,356
The human DNA...

1259
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,659
...that I implanted in the spiders...

1260
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:54,662
...was my own.

1261
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,300
Which means that without me...

1262
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,235
...without my bloodline...

1263
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:06,140
...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1264
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:08,976
Keep Electro incubated...

1265
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:13,314
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1266
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:19,286
I have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives.

1267
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,922
I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1268
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:25,026
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1269
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:29,063
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1270
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,098
But as a father...

1271
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:34,702
...it means I may not
see my boy again.

1272
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:38,973
And nothing is as important to me...

1273
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:41,776
...as my son, Peter.

1274
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:43,878
Nothing in this world.

1275
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:46,347
But I have a responsibility...

1276
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,783
...to protect the world
from what I've created...

1277
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:51,952
...and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1278
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,156
People will say I am a monster...

1279
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,825
...for what I've done.

1280
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,995
And maybe they're right.

1281
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:05,900
I always thought that I'd have more...

1282
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,168
...time.

1283
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,270
Dad? Dad!

1284
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,905
I'm sorry.

1285
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,325
Sedation off.

1286
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:40,267
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1287
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:42,803
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1288
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:44,738
Who are you?

1289
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:48,042
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1290
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:51,078
I should kill you.

1291
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:53,047
Oh, come on.

1292
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,382
Think bigger, Max.

1293
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,785
I'm not the one you want.

1294
01:35:57,985 --> 01:35:59,220
You want Spider-Man.

1295
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:02,490
And I can give him to you.

1296
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:07,428
But I need something first.

1297
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:11,098
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1298
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,000
Get you in?

1299
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:14,935
You own it.

1300
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,138
Not anymore.

1301
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:18,539
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1302
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:22,810
...so I can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1303
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:26,247
-What's happening?
-Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1304
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:29,083
Get a containment team up there now.

1305
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,385
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1306
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,354
You submitted the design for the grid...

1307
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:35,523
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1308
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:37,491
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1309
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:40,461
-How?
-It is all the power in the city, Max...

1310
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:42,796
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1311
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:44,832
And then once you shut down
the grid...

1312
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:48,969
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1313
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:51,972
Break it! Break it!

1314
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:56,510
Max, we don't have much time!

1315
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,180
Go! Go, go! Go!

1316
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,415
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1317
01:37:01,815 --> 01:37:02,850
Because I need you!

1318
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:05,586
You need me?

1319
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:08,923
Yes. I need you.

1320
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:13,227
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1321
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:16,497
-You need me?
-Yes. I need you.

1322
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:18,899
I need you. Please! Please!

1323
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:21,835
Please!

1324
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:24,004
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1325
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:25,206
Please, Max!

1326
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:27,341
I need you! I need you!

1327
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:18,892
No!

1328
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:24,431
You wanna be my friend?

1329
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:27,301
I thought we were already friends.

1330
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:30,337
I had a friend once.

1331
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,207
It didn't work out.

1332
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:35,376
Yeah. Me too.

1333
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:39,046
Then let's go catch a spider.

1334
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:44,985
You have one new voice message.

1335
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:49,056
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1336
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:53,994
I got in to Oxford.

1337
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:58,065
It's very exciting.

1338
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:01,935
I came by your house a little bit ago
and I....

1339
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:03,470
You weren't there...

1340
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:07,174
...and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now...

1341
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:10,277
...because there's this early
summer class that I found out about...

1342
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:13,380
...and I thought that
it would somehow...

1343
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:17,685
...be easier, I guess, this way.

1344
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:21,689
I think that maybe it's time...

1345
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:24,224
...to let this go.

1346
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:27,194
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1347
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:30,631
It's actually because I do, so....

1348
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:32,633
Okay, bye.

1349
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,583
-We have to move, now.
-Why? What's happened?

1350
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:04,231
Remember me?

1351
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:10,003
Oh, my, oh, my.

1352
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:12,172
How the tables have turned.

1353
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,142
I know it's hard to admit...

1354
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:19,613
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1355
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:23,484
-Am I right?
-Right as rain.

1356
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,688
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1357
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:30,724
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1358
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:35,295
-I want in to Special--
-How dare you come back in here?

1359
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:40,033
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1360
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,202
...urchin freaks.

1361
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:49,810
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1362
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:04,558
Clear.

1363
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:09,062
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1364
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:13,801
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1365
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:21,141
The grid is all yours.

1366
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,709
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1367
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:03,250
What is all this stuff?

1368
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,852
The future.

1369
01:42:18,665 --> 01:42:19,833
Load one up.

1370
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:25,706
It won't work.

1371
01:42:25,906 --> 01:42:29,643
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1372
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:33,814
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1373
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,887
Do it. Now.

1374
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:02,209
You had it all this time.

1375
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:32,699
It's Spider-Man.

1376
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:39,773
Stop the cab.

1377
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:42,009
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1378
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:14,341
-Hi.
-Hi.

1379
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:16,710
-Did you get my message?
-What message?

1380
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:19,646
-The message right there.
-Oh, that. That was you?

1381
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:21,682
-Don't do that.
-I couldn't make it out.

1382
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:23,984
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1383
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,487
Because I love you.

1384
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:30,857
-And no offense, but you're wrong.
-I'm wrong about what?

1385
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,993
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1386
01:45:33,326 --> 01:45:35,595
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1387
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,799
And you're always gonna be my path.

1388
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:43,403
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1389
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,405
But I'm tired of them.

1390
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:50,343
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1391
01:45:50,744 --> 01:45:52,679
We've all gotta make a choice.

1392
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:55,982
Right? Well, I choose you.

1393
01:45:58,685 --> 01:45:59,886
So...

1394
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:01,722
...here's my thought.

1395
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:04,691
England.

1396
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:07,427
Both of us.

1397
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,797
I'm following you now.

1398
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:13,100
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1399
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:15,736
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1400
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:20,040
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1401
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:21,975
-Yeah.
-They got tons of crime, it seems.

1402
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:24,111
-Tons.
-They got...

1403
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:26,480
...Jack the Ripper.

1404
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,115
What?

1405
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:30,984
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper
yet. You didn't know that?

1406
01:46:51,037 --> 01:46:52,172
What the hell is that?

1407
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:04,518
Is that Max?

1408
01:47:04,985 --> 01:47:07,187
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1409
01:47:15,862 --> 01:47:17,631
PNA 322, you are--

1410
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,966
-I'm black.
-I have nothing.

1411
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,636
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1412
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:25,438
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1413
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:27,574
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1414
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:31,578
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1415
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:34,648
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1416
01:47:34,848 --> 01:47:37,984
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1417
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:40,654
How will I stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1418
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:42,823
-Have you tried grounding them?
-Tried everything.

1419
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:45,058
-Rubber, plastic--
-Did you try magnetizing them?

1420
01:47:45,458 --> 01:47:47,828
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1421
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,163
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1422
01:47:50,897 --> 01:47:53,600
If you magnetize a nail with a battery....

1423
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:55,836
-It holds an electric charge.
-Yes.

1424
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:01,508
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1425
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:02,943
How do you hear?

1426
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:05,212
Approach, do you copy?

1427
01:48:05,612 --> 01:48:07,581
Radio's working. It's not us.

1428
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:19,059
Do not panic. Everyone,
please return to your vehicles.

1429
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:21,161
Go back to your cars.

1430
01:48:21,728 --> 01:48:22,896
Remain calm.

1431
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:26,933
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1432
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,702
-Go into your homes.
-Officer!

1433
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:30,136
Spider-Man!

1434
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,806
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1435
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,742
-I knew who he was. What can we do?
-Jumper cables.

1436
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:38,044
-Jumper cables?
-Yes. And copper wire.

1437
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:40,780
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1438
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:42,582
Yes.

1439
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,652
-Your suit'll ground you.
-All right, do it.

1440
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:51,691
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1441
01:48:51,892 --> 01:48:52,893
Okay, it works, good.

1442
01:48:53,093 --> 01:48:54,961
That is why you were number two
at Midtown.

1443
01:48:55,095 --> 01:48:56,630
Rub it in. Okay.

1444
01:48:58,231 --> 01:48:59,900
-I gotta go.
-I'm coming with you.

1445
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,868
-You're not coming with me.
-Yes, I am.

1446
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:03,570
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm coming.

1447
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:06,539
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1448
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:10,277
-I'm coming with you! You need me!
-Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1449
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:11,878
Shut the thing.

1450
01:49:12,178 --> 01:49:13,980
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1451
01:49:15,815 --> 01:49:17,083
Peter!

1452
01:49:17,284 --> 01:49:19,152
We still don't have backup generators.

1453
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:20,854
Get me Engineering!

1454
01:49:21,154 --> 01:49:24,557
-I need a respirator right now.
-They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1455
01:49:24,758 --> 01:49:25,892
Hang on.

1456
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:27,727
Okay.

1457
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:52,786
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1458
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:56,222
It's time to meet our destiny.

1459
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,873
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1460
01:50:14,074 --> 01:50:16,676
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1461
01:50:17,043 --> 01:50:19,212
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1462
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:26,252
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1463
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:29,856
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1464
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:31,858
-Time to impact?
-Four and a half minutes.

1465
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:33,126
Clock it right now.

1466
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:49,242
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1467
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:51,244
I designed this power grid.

1468
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:53,113
Now I'm gonna take back...

1469
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:55,081
...what is rightfully mine.

1470
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,717
I will control everything.

1471
01:50:57,917 --> 01:51:01,421
And I will be like a god to them.

1472
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,056
A god named Sparkles?

1473
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:14,768
Not this time.

1474
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:17,437
Is that all you got? Come on!

1475
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:37,857
Come on!

1476
01:51:42,062 --> 01:51:43,229
You ready to give up?

1477
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:56,342
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1478
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,822
Just shake it off. It's just your bones...

1479
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:11,124
...and your muscles and your organs.

1480
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:16,229
Oh, boy.

1481
01:52:23,736 --> 01:52:24,737
I hate this song!

1482
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:46,526
Spider-Man...

1483
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:48,328
...bet you never saw this coming.

1484
01:52:56,069 --> 01:52:57,904
Really? You web me to a car?

1485
01:52:58,171 --> 01:52:59,405
What are you, a caveman?

1486
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:00,974
You shouldn't be here.

1487
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:03,843
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1488
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:06,146
-What are you doing here?!
-I know the grid specs.

1489
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:07,780
I can reset the system!

1490
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:10,150
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1491
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:12,418
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1492
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:15,288
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1493
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:17,524
This is my choice, okay?

1494
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,827
My choice. This is mine.

1495
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,262
Now, how do we stop him?

1496
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:24,964
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1497
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:26,933
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1498
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,101
-It explodes.
-Right.

1499
01:53:28,234 --> 01:53:30,036
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1500
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,038
-Okay.
-I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1501
01:53:32,172 --> 01:53:33,806
But I need you to reset the system.

1502
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,910
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1503
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:39,379
-No matter what. No matter what.
-Peter.

1504
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:45,852
Go, go!

1505
01:54:37,904 --> 01:54:39,939
Sixty seconds to impact.

1506
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,441
Now, Gwen, now!

1507
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:16,943
Do it now!

1508
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:43,569
Uni 687--

1509
01:55:54,681 --> 01:55:57,517
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1510
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,287
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1511
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:02,722
Defend immediately.

1512
01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:19,339
Yes!

1513
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:22,208
People, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1514
01:56:22,408 --> 01:56:23,710
I'll be back in a minute.

1515
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:26,546
Oh, thank God. All right!

1516
01:56:26,746 --> 01:56:28,982
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1517
01:57:04,784 --> 01:57:06,619
I think we can still make your flight.

1518
01:57:15,495 --> 01:57:16,596
Gwen, stay there.

1519
01:57:42,655 --> 01:57:44,190
Peter.

1520
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:48,261
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1521
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:52,698
...you meant you said no.

1522
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:55,435
Harry, what did you do?

1523
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:57,637
What you made me do.

1524
01:57:58,271 --> 01:57:59,672
You were my friend...

1525
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,508
...and you betrayed me!

1526
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:03,843
No.

1527
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:06,345
I was trying to protect you.

1528
01:58:07,146 --> 01:58:08,347
Look at me.

1529
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:11,084
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1530
01:58:11,217 --> 01:58:12,351
You don't give people hope.

1531
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:14,554
You take it away.

1532
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:15,788
No, Harry.

1533
01:58:16,456 --> 01:58:18,424
I'm gonna take away yours.

1534
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,826
No. Gwen, run!

1535
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,594
Harry!

1536
01:58:22,295 --> 01:58:23,563
Harry, put her down!

1537
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,348
Harry, stop this right now!

1538
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:45,318
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1539
01:58:45,785 --> 01:58:47,720
-Harry.
-Harry is dead!

1540
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,890
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1541
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,326
Fight me! Let her go!

1542
01:58:53,759 --> 01:58:54,861
Okay.

1543
01:58:55,728 --> 01:58:56,729
No!

1544
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:06,339
You okay?

1545
01:59:11,644 --> 01:59:13,846
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1546
02:00:33,993 --> 02:00:34,994
Peter?

1547
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:40,960
Hey. Hey.

1548
02:01:44,363 --> 02:01:45,398
Gwen?

1549
02:01:47,933 --> 02:01:48,934
Hey.

1550
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:50,536
Hey!

1551
02:01:55,408 --> 02:01:56,475
Gwen?

1552
02:01:58,511 --> 02:01:59,512
Hey.

1553
02:02:02,948 --> 02:02:03,983
Breathe.

1554
02:02:05,618 --> 02:02:07,553
Hey, Gwen.

1555
02:02:08,554 --> 02:02:09,555
Hey.

1556
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:14,393
Hey.

1557
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:17,963
You're okay.

1558
02:02:21,767 --> 02:02:22,835
Gwen?

1559
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:30,376
Stay with me, stay with me.

1560
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:32,878
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1561
02:02:38,684 --> 02:02:39,752
Gwen.

1562
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:43,556
Gwen!

1563
02:02:46,559 --> 02:02:48,994
No, please, please.

1564
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:52,932
Please.

1565
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:02,041
I can't do this without you.

1566
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:06,131
Leave us.

1567
02:05:10,569 --> 02:05:12,037
You've made progress.

1568
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:15,608
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1569
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:17,877
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1570
02:05:18,077 --> 02:05:21,113
...this city will never be the same.

1571
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:23,949
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1572
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:25,818
Speaking of progress...

1573
02:05:25,985 --> 02:05:27,052
...you're looking better.

1574
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,889
It comes and goes.

1575
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:33,025
Tell me more.

1576
02:05:33,692 --> 02:05:35,127
How many men did you have in mind?

1577
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:37,530
I wanna keep it small.

1578
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:41,066
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1579
02:05:42,968 --> 02:05:44,603
Access granted.

1580
02:05:44,803 --> 02:05:46,739
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1581
02:05:46,972 --> 02:05:48,741
Who's our first volunteer?

1582
02:05:48,941 --> 02:05:50,776
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1583
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:53,112
Currently serving a life sentence.

1584
02:05:53,312 --> 02:05:54,680
He is...

1585
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,082
...most eager to join us.

1586
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:59,184
Good.

1587
02:05:59,919 --> 02:06:01,921
Start with him.

1588
02:06:02,254 --> 02:06:03,956
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...

1589
02:06:04,089 --> 02:06:06,191
...was broken out of
a classified penitentiary...

1590
02:06:06,325 --> 02:06:09,628
...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1591
02:06:09,762 --> 02:06:12,164
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...

1592
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:15,701
...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1593
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:19,104
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1594
02:06:19,238 --> 02:06:21,974
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...

1595
02:06:22,174 --> 02:06:24,176
...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...

1596
02:06:24,577 --> 02:06:26,645
...for the return of the web-slinger.

1597
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:29,281
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1598
02:06:29,615 --> 02:06:31,784
Where is Spider-Man?

1599
02:06:33,018 --> 02:06:35,354
Too bad about that spider guy.

1600
02:06:36,989 --> 02:06:39,892
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1601
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:43,128
Where you going?

1602
02:06:44,296 --> 02:06:47,032
-Eat my cereal.
-Peter.

1603
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:49,101
Where you going?

1604
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:00,112
I don't know.

1605
02:07:02,314 --> 02:07:04,083
You know, it's so funny.
I've been--

1606
02:07:04,883 --> 02:07:07,753
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized...

1607
02:07:08,087 --> 02:07:12,257
...and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1608
02:07:13,092 --> 02:07:16,862
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1609
02:07:17,663 --> 02:07:19,698
-You're throwing his stuff away?
-No.

1610
02:07:19,898 --> 02:07:21,066
No. God, no.

1611
02:07:21,367 --> 02:07:24,670
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1612
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:28,340
I'm just finding...

1613
02:07:29,308 --> 02:07:30,876
...a better place for it.

1614
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,415
I'm gonna take one last look...

1615
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:39,752
...and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1616
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:09,081
It's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1617
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:13,152
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1618
02:08:14,019 --> 02:08:16,455
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1619
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:21,427
And that's when hope is needed most.

1620
02:08:22,995 --> 02:08:25,030
No matter how buried it gets...

1621
02:08:25,898 --> 02:08:27,966
...or how lost you feel...

1622
02:08:28,167 --> 02:08:29,935
...you must promise me...

1623
02:08:30,135 --> 02:08:33,405
...that you will hold on to hope.

1624
02:08:35,174 --> 02:08:36,375
Keep it alive.

1625
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:40,012
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1626
02:08:40,212 --> 02:08:41,780
My wish for you...

1627
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,083
...is to become hope.

1628
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:46,018
People need that.

1629
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:49,254
And even if we fail...

1630
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,790
...what better way is there to live?

1631
02:08:53,258 --> 02:08:55,060
As we look around here today...

1632
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,731
...at all of the people
who helped make us who we are...

1633
02:08:59,298 --> 02:09:01,834
...I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1634
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:05,003
But we will carry
a piece of each other...

1635
02:09:05,204 --> 02:09:08,006
...into everything that we do next...

1636
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:12,745
...to remind us of who we are...

1637
02:09:14,446 --> 02:09:16,281
...and of who we're meant to be.

1638
02:09:18,517 --> 02:09:20,853
I've had a great four years with you.

1639
02:09:21,053 --> 02:09:23,055
I'll miss you all very much.

1640
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:46,445
Let's go! Move it.

1641
02:09:54,953 --> 02:09:56,321
Get down! Take cover!

1642
02:10:00,192 --> 02:10:04,429
I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1643
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:06,999
A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit...

1644
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:08,534
...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1645
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:15,274
I am the Rhino!

1646
02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:18,010
I told you I would be back!

1647
02:10:29,221 --> 02:10:31,323
-No! No!
-A kid!

1648
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:37,896
Hold your fire!

1649
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,498
Everybody, hold your fire.

1650
02:10:40,365 --> 02:10:43,435
-Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
-Civilian in our line of sight.

1651
02:10:47,406 --> 02:10:48,440
Kid! You gotta get--

1652
02:10:50,576 --> 02:10:52,411
Look, New York!

1653
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:54,479
Spider-Man is back.

1654
02:10:55,147 --> 02:10:56,148
Leave the kid alone!

1655
02:10:56,348 --> 02:10:58,317
That's my baby! Please.

1656
02:11:01,353 --> 02:11:03,422
Brave boy.

1657
02:11:03,856 --> 02:11:06,124
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1658
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:24,977
Hey, Spider-Man.

1659
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,555
I knew you'd come back.

1660
02:11:37,155 --> 02:11:39,424
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1661
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,526
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1662
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:44,663
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1663
02:11:45,063 --> 02:11:47,499
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1664
02:11:54,539 --> 02:11:55,674
You fight me?

1665
02:11:56,141 --> 02:11:58,176
You fight me now?

1666
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:02,481
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1667
02:12:02,681 --> 02:12:05,684
...I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1668
02:12:06,084 --> 02:12:07,085
Never!

1669
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:10,289
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1670
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:12,090
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1671
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:13,325
Yes!

1672
02:12:13,525 --> 02:12:14,693
I'll be right there.

1673
02:12:15,193 --> 02:12:17,029
There's no place like home.
