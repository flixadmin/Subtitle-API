00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,493
Here are your schedules for the day.

162
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,788
This covers your duties as Mayor
and this as kingpin of the underworld.

163
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,334
(CHUCKLES) You really are settling into
your role here, aren't you, Ed?

164
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,002
And yet,
I still have so much to learn from you.

165
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,007
(BOTH CLEAR THROATS)

166
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,052
I came up empty tracking down Butch.

167
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,977
Somehow, that one-handed ape
managed to disappear.

168
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,976
I suspect he's hiding with his old crew.

169
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,255
I'm sorry for letting you down.

170
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,987
You have done nothing of the sort.

171
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,614
I would be lost without you.

172
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,534
In fact, um,

173
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,371
there is something
that I need to tell you.

174
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,328
Something very important.

175
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,458
What is it, Oswald?

176
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,219
You know what? I forget. (LAUGHS)

177
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,512
In and out of my head just like that.
Don't you hate that, when that happens?

178
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
That never happens to me.

179
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,192
You know what? I believe that.
So, where are we off to first?

180
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,652
PS 134. You're touring a school.

181
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,024
Press will be there,
so we better get a move on.

182
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,360
(CHUCKLES) Great. I love children.

183

184
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,199
Okay, thank you very much. Good.

185
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,580
Hey, Cap!
I just spoke to that kid over there.

186
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,962
You're not gonna believe this.
He said Jim Gordon saved his life.

187
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,688
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.

188
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,049
Get him on the phone. Now.

189
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,514
I already tried him. No answer.

190
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,928
What happened? You forget your cane?

191
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,805
I don't need it anymore.

192
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,812
Put an all-points out on Gordon.
I want him found.

193
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,902
Hey, does that guy look strange to you?
I mean, more so than the usual wackjob?

194
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,025
Hey, pal!

195
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,992
You see what happened here?

196
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,449
Have a message for you.

197
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,539
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

198

James Gordon, I have a message for you.

199

00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,309
I like what you've done with the place.

Let's chat face-to-face.

209
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,943
I wonder, what is it that you have
against married couples?

210
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,450
Bad memories, perhaps?

211
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,909
Understandable.

212
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,121
Given the last time you saw
a woman in a wedding dress,

213
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,207
she had a shotgun pointed at you.

214
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,537
Hey, Jervis.

215
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,879

This is about your sister, isn't it?

221
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,749
In your addled brain,
you blame me for what happened to her.

222
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,934
Don't you talk about her!

223
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,232
I got to know her, Jervis.
She was a good person.

224
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,980
That's why she hated you.

225
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,029
Why she died trying to get away from you.

226
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,486
You want revenge? Kill yourself.

227
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,205
Dismissive. Rude.
I don't like your attitude.

228
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,500
I'll tell you what. I'll come down.
We can talk about it in person.

229
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,415
Hang up again, she dies.

230

What're you talking about? Who?

231
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,048
Surprising, really.

232
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,386
Given that every relationship
you've been in ended in such misery.

233
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,056
And yet, you made the choice
to date again.

234
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,727
Poor girl, she had no idea
who she was getting into bed with.

235
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,348
She will soon. See for yourself.

00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
No. No!

319
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,386
I'm gonna find you.

320
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,224
Oh, I'm counting on it. Just ask
an old friend how to get to the end.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

322
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,945
This is our third grade class.

(KIDS CHATTERING)

324
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,615
How many more grades do we have to visit?

325
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,447
This is a K through 12 building.

326
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,077
- Twelve?
- Mmm-hmm.

327
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,284
But, we don't have to see
every single class, do we?

328
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,293
Mayor James used to read to the children.

329
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,212
Aubrey James is illiterate, ma'am.

330
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,045
- It's well documented.
- Perhaps we should move on.

(GASPS)

332
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,904
What's wrong with that boy there?

333
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,639
That's Luke.

334
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,309
He's new here.

335
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,065
Hello, Luke. I am Mayor Cobblepot.

336
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,613
Why aren't you playing
with the other children?

337
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,986
What if they don't like me?

338
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,116
Well, how would you ever know
if you don't give it a try?

339
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,456
And if they don't like you,

340
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,339
wait for them to turn their backs
and push them down the stairs.

Little guy needed a push, that's all.

Ed...

345
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,195
There is something I would like
to discuss in a more private setting.

346
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,278
Shall we say dinner at the mansion? 8:00?

347
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,506
I'll pick us up a nice bottle of wine.

Tetch has Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.
You're sure?

350
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,373
I saw him take Vale and
I called Lee's cell and he answered.

351
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,790
So, yeah, pretty sure.

352
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,136
Call the ME's office. Call her fiancé.
Find her!

353
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,640
What the hell is going on here?

354
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,348
Tetch blames me for
what happened to his sister.

355
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,641
He wants revenge.

356
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,436
So what? He kills two innocent civilians?
How does that track?

357
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,192
He's obsessed with
showing me who I really am.

358
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,144
Driving me insane.

359
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,440
He killed them, and I just stood there!

360
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,116
What were you supposed to do?
Shoot one of them?

361
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,243
You did what you could. That's on him.

362
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,864
This is just to prepare me.

363
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,408
He's gonna make me choose.

364
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,001
He's gonna
put me in front of Lee and Vale,

365
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,876
and he's gonna make me choose.
And if I don't...

366
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,427
He'll kill both of them.

367
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,553
We're gonna find her.

368
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,268
I promise you that.

369
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,645
Listen to me. Tetch is a lunatic.
He's gonna get caught.

370
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,450
The most you can hope for
is a lifetime in prison. Don't do this.

371
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,939
Dumfree, let's see what's in the kitchen.

372
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,866
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,617
Nice try.

374
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,699
So, why'd they bring us
back to your place?

375
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,950
Like I know?

376
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,284
Any chance your boyfriend might come home?

377
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,540
Not likely.

You do know what this is about, don't you?

380
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,677
Yes. Tetch blames Jim for his sister,
and we're his means for revenge.

381
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,920
I've been here before.

382
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,973
That's too big.
It's never going to spring the mechanism.

383
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,777
You know, it is kind of ironic, though.

384
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,523
I was just asking Jim to get me
a sit-down with you. And here we are.

385
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,599
Uh-huh.

386
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,436
See, I'm writing a story
on Alice Tetch's blood.

387
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,485
I know you're running point for the GCPD.

388
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,034
You're not seriously trying
to interview me right now, are you?

389
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,492
- Jim said you wouldn't talk to me.
- And he was right.

390
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,867
I think he was just
being protective of you.

391
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,751
Anyway, about Alice Tetch.

392
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,248
I hear they're running experiments
on her blood at the GCPD bio facility.

393
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,498
Care to comment?

394
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,189
Maybe you're just really scared
and this is your way of coping

395
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,249
or maybe you're just
insanely committed to your job.

396
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,931
Either way, all I'm interested in
is getting out of here.

397
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,228
Try a cuticle pusher. My dad was a cop.
Taught me how to pick locks.

398
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,725
I can walk you through it.

399
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,681
Thank you.

400
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,302
And in exchange,
you can talk to me about Alice Tetch.

401
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,666
You and Jim are made for each other.

402
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,529
Thanks.

403
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,156
It's not a compliment.

404

Thank you, Dr. Calvi.
I'll call you as soon as we hear anything.

Mario's been in surgery all morning.

406
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,038
Says that he and Lee
left the house together this morning.

407
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,765
She was headed to the station.
He hasn't heard from her since.

408
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,587
Jervis must have grabbed her
before she got here.

409
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,544
What's his next move?

410
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,911
Tetch wants me to find him.

411
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,544
Well, if that's the case, then
why didn't he just tell you where he is?

412
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,435
I don't know. But the last thing he said

413
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,673
was something about
an old friend leading me to him.

414
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,637
Well, I'm not just gonna sit here and wait
for Tetch to send you an invitation.

Listen up!

Jervis Tetch thinks that Gotham
is his personal playground.

417
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,692
He's taken innocent lives.

418
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,566
And now,
he has Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.

419
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,694
And to whoever puts the collar on Tetch,

and best bottle of brown.

Look, you're just gonna have to trust me.

435

Trust you? According to Captain Barnes,

you're the reason
she's in trouble to begin with.

Does Barnes know? Where is he?

440
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,746
No. He does not know.
Because, if he showed up with 20 cops,

both Lee and Vale would be dead.

442
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:27,219
I see. So, you're going to go in all alone
and save them? Is that it?

Actually, you might be the only person
who can help me. Come on.

As long as it's not about

The way I hear it, you made a pretty nice
life for yourself down South.

Gotten a new job.

Bravo, James.

490

Now, I'd like to begin by telling
the story of a brother and a sister,

491
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,558
separated for years,
but whose love never waned.

492
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,651
Fair warning though,

493
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,854
it has a sad ending.

494
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,214
But, I couldn't find my sister alone.

495
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,384
So I turned to this man, James Gordon.

496
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,974
Whom everyone said was a good man,
an honorable man.

497
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,975
And what did this good man do?
Why, he found my sister

498
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,684
and he turned her against me!

499
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,774
Poisoning her mind!
And then he killed her!

500
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,730
Does that sound about right, James?

501
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,108
- Sure. Why not?
- Now, James.

502
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,823
I get the sense you're not being honest.

503
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,612
Though, that's not surprising

504
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:08,205
considering you've run from your true self
every day of your life.

505
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,418
But you can't run from this choice.

507
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,295

508
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,636
I just need to figure out which one it is.

509
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:24,183
So, let's review our options, shall we?

510
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,324
On the one hand, we have Lee Thompkins.

Intelligent. Kind.

512

She thought she could
save you from your darkness.

Drag you into the light.
And what did she get for her efforts, hmm?

514
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,547
- Pain and sadness.
- Don't listen to him, Lee.

515
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,005
Look in her eyes,

516
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,681
she still has love for you, James.

517
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,019
And then there's Valerie Vale.

518
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,232
The intrepid reporter
from a blue-collar family.

519
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,314
She still has hope for you.

What will happen
when she learns who you really are?

521
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,362
So,

522

Now, you drop your gun.

- And why would I do that?
- Because I'll shoot you.

- Well, well.
- You okay?

and shoot me dead?

536

But, there's only one small problem.

537

Before you arrived,
I went down to the basement

- Don 't.

- Your sister knew you were crazy, Jervis.
- Stop it.

549
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,001
- She was terrified of you. She hated you.
- Enough.

550
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,540
She told me,

551
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,623
what you did to her when you were kids.

552
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,384

- Lies! Deceit!

The story you tell is incomplete!
She loved me!

00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,886
She loved you? She killed herself
rather than be with you.

555

She didn't! No.

and died in agony.

than having you touch her.

she was finally safe from you,

00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,206
What am I?

633
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,247
Time.

634
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,630
I'm Edward.

635
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,554
Edward Nygma.

636
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,603
Jim, how is she?

637
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,309
Still in surgery.

638
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,517
She seems like a tough cookie.
She'll be all right.

639
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,400
What about Tetch?

640
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,617
We got the whole department
canvassing the city. We'll find him.

641
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,411
Why didn't you come to me?

642
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,240
I couldn't.

643
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,243
And I thought I could save 'em both.

644
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,084
You did what you thought was right.

645
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,582
Maybe.

646
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,175
In the end, I did exactly what he wanted.

647
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,557
He won.

648
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,685
We'll see.

(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

651
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,704
Mario's a great doctor.
She'll pull through.

652
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,674
- Lee, about what I said...
- Jim.

653
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,336
Not now.
