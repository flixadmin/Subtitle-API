1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Ever since you began
to build your empire,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,760
you've had a crutch to lean on.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,080
MICHAEL: I swear in the name
of Almighty God,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,400
I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,240
That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
Perhaps we can meet after you've spoken
with your wife's uncle, Jack Nelson.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,560
Tommy Shelby wants
to do business with Jack Nelson?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,600
So, speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,240
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,280
I will sell to the
East Boston Jews.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,120
It's Ruby. She's not well.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm coming home.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,120
This programme contains
strong language

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,480
POLLY: There will be a war in this
family and one of you will die.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,400
MICHAEL: You've been too busy to
punish the people that killed her.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,200
How is the family?

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,680
Daddy.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,440
Hello, Ruby.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,920
Come here.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,080
Let me see you.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,200
I missed you. I missed you.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
That is a Black Madonna.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,680
What presents did you get us, Dad?

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
Son.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,680
She's all better, Tommy.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,160
You came back for nothing.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,880
But I'm glad you're back.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,840
Right, before we do anything else,

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,320
we're going to go for a drive, OK?

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,840
Let's go. What about me?

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah, you can come too, come on.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,240
A drive where?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
I've asked the driver to take
us to see Dr Robert.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,560
I want him to have a look at Ruby.
Why, love?

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,840
The appointment is in one hour,
you can stay here or you can come.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Right.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,920
Right, let's go.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,480
TOMMY GRUNTS AND RETCHES

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,280
HE COUGHS

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
Tommy?

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Yeah?

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,360
It was all good.
Everything was clear.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
That is a relief.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,880
That's a relief.
Yeah.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,320
Driver's bringing the car round.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
TAP ON WINDOW
Daddy.

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Hiya.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Come here.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,920
When did you last sleep?

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,480
Well, now you know Ruby's all clear,
you can sleep.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,600
Lizzie, I am very happy that
Ruby's results are clear.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
But still you won't sleep.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,080
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,240
LIZZIE SIGHS

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
We could be on holiday.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,040
We could be up a mountain
in America.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,840
That wouldn't have been possible.

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,720
The man I'm dealing with is coming
to London. I need to be there.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
No escape.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,720
We will escape, Lizzie.
One last deal to be done.

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
It'll be difficult.
Difficulties are to be expected.

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
This is why I must move
from item to item.

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,080
Do you feel that?

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
Do you feel anything?

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
You know, you talk as if you're
watching everything on a screen.

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,720
When we go home. When we go home,

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,000
we'll give the kids to Frances,
and then you and me will go to bed.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,760
And I will be the next item.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,760
That's how it feels now, Tommy.
Yeah.

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,080
Everything on a list.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
Hey, baby.
When are we going home?

Fuck, fuck.

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,120
Fuck.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,680
Tommy. Come here. Come here.

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960

TOMMY BREATHES

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
It is four years...

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,040
..one month and six days

89
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
since I had a drink.

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,000
My head is clear.

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
I am myself.

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Is this the first time?

93
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,480
Once on the ship back. Not as bad.

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,400
Tommy...

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,480
..you need to see a doctor.

96
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
I've work to do.

97
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,200
It's the work that's to blame.

98
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

99
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,920
We're going to keep going till
the Boston business is done.

100
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
Then we rest.

101
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,960
Then we Peaky Blinders fucking rest.

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,760
Comrades, before we
end this planning meeting

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
and send you out into the rain...
LIGHT CHUCKLES

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
..we have a surprise.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,240
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

106
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,600
He came back early

107
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,920
and he has insisted on addressing
you volunteers in person.

108
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
Comrades,

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.
RAUCOUS CHEERING

I bring with me on
the train from London...

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,840
..a message from Westminster.

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,840
No. No, no, no, not a message.

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,960
Not a message.

115
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,560
An instruction, in fact.

You must say nothing.

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,120
Say nothing about the present
situation in this city.

120
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
Say nothing about hunger.

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Say nothing about jobs.

122
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,560
Say nothing about pay.

123
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,440

But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,000
the cuts in wages and
in welfare and in dignity.

137
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
And you must not complain,

138
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,360
because that would be unpatriotic.

139
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,480
You soldiers,
who have fought in France,

140

you are traitors if you speak up.

because I have heard your voices
when you come to me

and tell me about
the cries of your hungry children,

single one of those cries

166
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,840
and makes the cars
and melts the metal.

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,760
And the King, remember him,

168
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,480
the man who ordered all of this,

169
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
shouldn't he be taking
some of the cuts?

170
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
Eh, some of the blows?

171
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Some of the pain? No or yes?

172
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,160
CROWD: YES!

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
Hush.

174
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,920
Hush, you working men and women.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,320
Silence.

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
Good.

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,280
WHISPERS: Save your voices.

178
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,920
You are going to need them on
Saturday when we rally together

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
at the Bull Ring Market...

180
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
CROWD CHEERS

181
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,560
..and together,
we'll raise the roof,

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,760
we'll break the damned silence...

183
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,200
..and bring down this broken
government.

184
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
CROWD CHEERS RAUCOUSLY

185
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,760
CROWD CHANTS: Tommy, Tommy.

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Tommy, Tommy...

187
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
Thank you.

188
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,920
Laura McKee.

189
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,400
Battalion Commander, Fermanagh IRA.

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,680
You missed the first
and second act.

191
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,240
Thank you for coming, Mr Shelby.

192
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,560
Thank you. Thank you.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
The third act was enough.

194
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,880
You both have reasons to hate me

195
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing of...

196
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Sh.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
Gypsy tradition.

198
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,400
We do not mention the name of
the dead in company.

199
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,200
Laura McKee,

200
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,000
in the Shelby family,

201
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,480
business comes before issues
of vengeance.

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,640
Our beloved departed would
understand and approve.

203
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
Let's go, boys.

204
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,360
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

205
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,640
No need for crowds.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,040
We need you alive.

207
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
After you.

208
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,040
You know, Mr Shelby, even though
we've been doing business for a while,

209
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,920
we've never met in person.

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,320
You spoke with passion
and compassion.

211
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,520
You understand forgiveness

212
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
and you drink water.

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Yet I heard from many reliable
sources

214
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,040
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

215
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
TOMMY SNIFFS

216
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
"Moral turpitude".

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,200
It's a good name for a racehorse.

218
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,640
You don't know what it means?

219
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,760
I know what it means.

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,400
It means you fuck people.

221
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
Fuck people over. Don't give a fuck.

222
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
It means you covet and steal

223
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,080
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

224
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,200
Well, I'm changing, Laura McKee,

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,400
and my organisation
is also changing.

226
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,000
So, what happened in Boston?

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Jack Nelson said no.

228
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Are we accepting "no" as an answer?

229
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,480
These are letters written to

230
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,240
and by Jack Nelson
over the last three months.

231
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
TRAIN RUMBLES PAST

232
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,760
This...

233
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
This is a private letter from
the President of the United States.

234
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,080
Where the fuck did you get this?

235
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,520
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

236
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,360
is just one of many in my stables.

237
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Sometimes even now I'll
take her out for a run,

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,080
if there is a good cause that
requires her services.

239
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,480
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

240
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licenses.

241
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,520
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

242
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,400
He's come to measure the strength of
support for fascism in Britain.

243
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
He'll report back to the President.

244
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,680
And how does that help us?

245
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
In this letter to his son,

246
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,840
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

247
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,560
In this letter to a friend
in Berlin,

248
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,640
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

249
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

250
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,360
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

251
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,840
And you and I are going
to help him in that task.

252
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
I thought you were a socialist.

253
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Well...

254
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
..since I've entered politics,

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,120
I've learned that
the line doesn't go out from

256
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
the middle to the left
and the right.

257
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,880
It goes in a circle.

258
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,120
I'll show you.

259
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,840
You go far enough left,

260
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,200
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

261
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,920
to get to the same place.

262
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,440
Working-class socialists like me,

263
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,600
working-class nationalists like you.

264
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,000
The result?

265
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,680
National Socialism.

266
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,960
And that's me,

267
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
in the middle.

268
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Just a man trying to make an honest
living in a very dark world.

269
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,040
You have friends in Dublin,
Laura McKee,

270
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,280
who are actively fighting for
a Fascist Ireland.

271
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,560
And you are acting on their behalf,
ain't you?

272
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,440
When Jack Nelson comes to London,

273
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,120
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

274
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,640
and to Fascist sympathisers
in the House of Commons

275
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
and the House of Lords,
on both sides of the divide.

276
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
Fascism is quite the thing...

277
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,920
..among the very best people.

278
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,120
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

279
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,600
And you think this will allow us
to ship our merchandise to Boston?

280
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,400
Perhaps.

281
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,920
There may be other
benefits for your cause.

282
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

283
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,120
and talk to him about a new
"golden age"

284
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,720
and let him put a pin in
the map of Ireland

285
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
for the President
of the United States.

286
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

287
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,600
I came to collect
Arthur and put him to bed.

288
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,760
I found him in the Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

289
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,800
TOMMY SIGHS

290
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,760
A friend loves at all times...

291
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
..but a brother is born
for adversity.

292
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Proverbs 17, 17.

293
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,920
I have two brothers in need,
but yours is the more urgent, Tommy.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
Will you come with me?

295
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,640
So, Laura McKee...

296
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,040
..are you going to help me
change the world?

297
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,360
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

298
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
Never is.

299
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Is that a yes or a no?

300
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
My answer's yes.

301
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
The answer's always yes.

302
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,720
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

303
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,920
And tell your friends back home,

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Tommy Shelby has changed.

305
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
Where is he?

306
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,640
When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

307
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,600
He was sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

308
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

309
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
It's all under control, Ada.

310
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,920
Well, I'm not under fucking control.

311
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,200
Even though I'm trying to be.

313
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,560
She would have stopped this.

314
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,320
We will pull Arthur through this.

315
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you.

316
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,720
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

317
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,360
Ada, this will be the end of it,
do you hear me?

318
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
This is the way out for all of us.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,560
And along the way,
I will be doing good.

320
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
No, along the way, you're going to
make yourself a lot of fucking money.

321
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,040
All right, fair enough.

322
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,160
Any incidental rewards
for my good work will be welcome.

323
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,360
But you will get your fair share, sister.
SHE SCOFFS

324
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,960
And by being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

325
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,400
I can undermine them.

326
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
Polly would approve.

327
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,400
Beneath all the gold and diamonds,
and fucking,

328
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,160
fucking mink and lace,

329
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,520
she was a solid Socialist.

330
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,480
TRAIN RUMBLES OVERHEAD

331
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,320
Look, I know it's too late for this,
Tom, but...

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,880
..this doorway,

333
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
this same fucking doorway.

334
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
We used to come here for Dad's beer

335
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
and we were so little it took two
of us carry one bucket.

336
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,160
Yeah, I remember.

337
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
Look at us now, eh?

338
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,160
Yeah.

339
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Fucking look at us.

340
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,760
Take a good look, Tom,

341
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,880
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

342
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,520
Fuck, opium and presidents!

343
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,320
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

344
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
..then I wouldn't blame you.

345
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
But this is my mission.

346
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,440
And I will have no limitations.

347
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
Where are you, Tom?

348
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,560
Hm?

349
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,680
My big brother?

350
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
You know you used
to stop sometimes and laugh.

351
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,240
Do you even remember this place?

352
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
You walk into the Garrison like a
stranger and you sip fucking water.

353
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,000
But I'm alive, Ada.

354
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,520
Yeah.

355
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,640
And you're still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

356
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Well...

357
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
..I think you might have found it.

358
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,840
I have a child, Tommy.

359
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,760
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

360
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,440
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison Alley

361
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,840
and the other has no limitations.

362
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,640
MUSIC IN BACKGROUND: Nessun Dorma
By Puccini

363
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm expected.

364
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,280
# Dilegua, o notte

365
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,400
# Tramontate, stelle... #

366
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,320
Oh, and Mr Solomons
no longer tolerates

367
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,760
the smoking of tobacco
in his presence.

368
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,000
# All'alba vincero

369
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
# Vincero

370
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:52,560
# Vincero! #

371
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,720
I always thought that opera was just
fat people fucking shouting.

372
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah. What do you think now?

373
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,880
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

374
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,840
reminds me of the crying
out of Italian soldiers

375
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,800
when they had my bayonet
inside them.

376
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,040
Ever since my own death,
I have been somewhat haunted by it.

377
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
Dear me.

378
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,400
But instead of fighting
these voices, I decided

379
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,160
to write their songs down, y'know,
turn them into an opera of my own.

380
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
Do not light that.

381
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,440
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

382
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,320
What I was told, Alfie...

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,360
..is that you have withdrawn and
that you spend your days alone...

384
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,520
..obsessing about opera singers.

385
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,440
Opera's not fucking singing, is it?

386
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,840
It's not singing.

387
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,600
It is the sound that people make
before words.

388
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,520
And I do not allow smoking because
I do need to see fucking clearly,

389
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
all right?

390
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,120
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

391
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Not a sense of weakness,
no, Alfie. Huh.

392
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,800
A certain knowledge of it.

393
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,480
Since you have been sat here...
writing your opera...

394
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,440
..a member of your family has died.

395
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,240
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

396
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,840
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging, prostitution,

397
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,120
gambling syndicates
out of east Boston.

398
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,600
But last January, poor old Charlie,
well...

399
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,160
..he was shot in the Cotton Club,

400
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,000
in the lavatory,
by men that you know.

401
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,800
And yet you did nothing, Alfie.
LOUD CLANGING

402
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,160
Now my opera is called America.

403
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,760
America is my fucking masterpiece.

404
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,360
The truth is, your uncle is dead.

405
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,600
Boston is gone and you,

406
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,520
once the big man
who ran Camden Town,

407
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,560
now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette.

408
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,480
Let alone his fucking life.

409
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,000
You need favours, Alfie.
I need a fucking final act, right.

410
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,320
Just a final fucking act
for my opera. Yeah?

411
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Alfie, I think I may have written
your final act.

412
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,880
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

413
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,360
I have five tonnes of pure,
refined opium

414
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,080
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

415
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,440
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

416
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,120
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

417
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,520
Quebec, New York and Boston.

418
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,400
The income would be immediate
and would shift the balance of power

419
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,880
in Boston back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

420
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,920
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

421
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,800
it is you who takes the revenge.

422
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
Why would you sell?

423
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
The Irish are being difficult.

424
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,360
The Italians are not an option.

425
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,120
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

426
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,960
Pay you with credit? No.

427
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,880
Oh. I will take property.

428
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,160
You own half the warehouses
in Camden.

429
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,200
I would take them and knock them
down, build houses

430
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,360
for the needy and the deserving. Oh.

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,040
ALFIE GROANS

432
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah, well, the, erm...

433
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,640
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain't they?

434
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,680
For about fucking 700 years.

435
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,240
HE SNIFFS

436
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,040
You know that I once saw
an Irishman arguing with

437
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
the statue of Oliver Cromwell
in Parliament Square.

438
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
The argument went on for quite
a while, actually.

439
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,440
It went into the night and his
little voice echoed all around

440
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,920
the Houses of Parliament
as he got more

441
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,240
and more angered at
Oliver Cromwell's reluctance

442
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,160
on what to answer his legitimate
questions.

443
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,040
So angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

444
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,320
the statue on the nose
and broke his fucking hand.

445
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,680
And there it is, y'know.
the Irish question, innit.

446
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,600
How come you can remember so much
about what happened 200 years ago,

447
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,120
but you just can't remember
what fucking happened last night?

448
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
ALFIE SIGHS

449
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,280
How much is a tonne?

450
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,000
Johnny.

451
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,560
Only me today.

452
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,480
Jack says a few more weeks...

453
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,720
KEYS JINGLE

454
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,440
..then you'll be free.
When do you travel to London?

455
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,440
Tomorrow.

456
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,560
I came to say goodbye.

457
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,600
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

458
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,400
Block your fucking ears
if you have too.

459
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
I will be with you, Michael.

460
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,240
I've been thinking about you.

461
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,000
Only you.

462
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,520
And don't worry about Tommy Shelby.

463
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,680
I have no interest in a dead man.

464
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,400
Jack says he has to die.

465
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,000
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

466
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,000
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

467
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,080
It will be you. I know.

468
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,000
I told Jack.

469
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,880
And Jack said,
"OK. Let the kid do it."

470
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,240
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won't.

471
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,800
Five million dollars.

472
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,720
The devil will be dead.

473
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,480
The future belongs to us.

474
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh, and, erm, Michael.

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,640
Every night...

476
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,440
..midnight in Boston,
5am in London...

477
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,880
..I'll be wide awake in my big
wide bed,

478
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,480
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

479
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,160
And our souls will come together,
and we'll fuck.

480
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,000
I won't need an alarm clock.

481
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,280
And you won't sleep until I'm done.

482
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,200
Midnight fucks 5am.

483
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,720
Every day.

484
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,320
Because we trust each other.

485
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
Hm.

486
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,480
RAISED VOICES

487

And also from below.

493
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,120
Darling, how is that?

494
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
You look absolutely terrifying,
my love.

495
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,400

A long and terrible journey, Diana.

499
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,200
Don't fucking let me down.

500
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,400
Mr Shelby! Mr Shelby! Daily Mirror.

501
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,840
Off!

502
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,760
May I ask why a socialist MP
would attend a Fascist rally, sir?

503
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,080
Let him in,
let me answer the question.

504
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
Mr Mosley's constituency borders
my own.

505
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,880
We have worked together in the past.

506
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,000
He was once a socialist himself.

507
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,120
My role here tonight
is to...to act as a bridge

508
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,240
between ideologies.

509
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,080
I am in the middle.

510
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,600
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

511
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,120
Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight? No.

512
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,360
I am simply here to remind my friend
Mr Mosley

513
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
that the way of the British people
is compromise.

514
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,080
And you can print that, pal.

515
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,000
Fucking rag.

516
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,760
Lizzie, you should know Mosely's
wife died six months ago.

517
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,240
Give him your condolences, will you?

518
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Tonight,
he will be with his mistress.

519
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,400
Who is apparently
a Lady of some standing...

520
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,840
..and has given him great comfort
in his time of grief.

521
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,200
ARTHUR: Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

522
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,120
Move out of my fucking way.
What is Arthur doing here?

523
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,640
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

524
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,600
Arthur made me a promise,
which he appears to have broken.

525
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,920
Move. I said fucking move.

526
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,200
I tried my best.

527
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,760
He hid some junk in his sock. OK.

528
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,200
Move along.

Mosely invited me.
He said wear a black fucking shirt.

534
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,680
I said I would look like every other
bastard.

Lizzie. Come on. For fuck's sake.

You're an angel.
I know I've fucking let you down.

I've fucking let you down,
I know I have. All right?

538
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,040
I've fucking said sorry a million
times and I'll say it again.

539
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm sorry, all right? Yeah? I'm
fucking sorry. Look at Johnny Dogs.

00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,720
Fucking look at the state of him.

541
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,920
He looks like a fucking waiter.

542
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,280
Oh, Shut up. Get me a fucking drink.

543
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

544
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,360
For fuck's sake, Tommy.

545
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Take your fucking shirt off and give
it me now. Get it off!

546
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,720
Arthur, this is my fault.

00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,600
This is my fault. Yeah.

548
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,160
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade?

549
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,360
You voted no. I said no.
Remember, I overruled you.

550
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,320
I've not been here, I've been away.
Where have you been, Tom?

551
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,040
Ada tells me you've been hanging
out with Mosely?

552
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,160
Yeah, he's... Yeah? Yeah, in his
big beautiful fucking house.

553
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,640
Had parties there in Belgravia.

554
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,080
And they give me fucking respect.

555
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,000
And what do you give them?
Snow and junk from the company.

556
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,680
Look at you, brother.

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,080
You slapped me.

562
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,920
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

563
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Unresolved.
Unresolved in everything.

564
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade.

565
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
And maintain the trust of both.

566
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,400
And I cannot have my brother wearing
a fucking black shirt

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,120
on the cover of the Daily Mirror.

If anyone takes my picture in this,

569
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,360
they'll find their fucking camera
under my heel, Tom.

570
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,320
They are throwing petrol bombs out
there Tommy.

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,280
I thought Ada was taking care
of you.

572
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,960
Ada's got decisions to make about
working with us.

573
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,840
She doesn't know what she wants.
I'll speak to Ada.

574
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,640
Listen, I'm going home, all right?
No. You stay there.

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,520
I have something for you.

Johnny, take Lizzie to her seat.

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,560
I don't have an invitation, Tom.

578
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,360
You're wearing a fucking black
shirt, you can do what you like.

579
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,840
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

580
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,760
Go on, Dogs. Get me a fucking drink

I know, Tom. Look at me.

583
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,320
Arthur, before I went to America
I wrote a letter.

584
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,960
Yeah? Who to?

585
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
To Linda.

586
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,320
And in that letter I wrote,

587
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,480
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

588
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,280
"do you believe in forgiveness?"

589
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,840
And this is what I got back.
Two days ago. Have a look.

590
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,880
"As a Christian woman, I do believe
in forgiveness."

591
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah, and the word "do"
is underlined.

592
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,960
Arthur, I am no Christian.

593
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
But I also believe in forgiveness.

594
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,440
So, get yourself clean.

595
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,160
Stay clean for two weeks,
I'll write Linda another letter.

596
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,680

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,760
Hmm. I hear you prefer Berlin.

647
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,680
Oswald and I are going to marry
there, aren't we, Oswald? Hm.

648
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,280
Mosely, I have business to discuss.

649
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

650
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,040
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

651
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,320
that we men go off
and discuss business

652
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,440
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

653
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,640
SHE CHUCKLES
Goodness.

654
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,680
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

655
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,440
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

656
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,920
But, Mr Shelby, if it's business,

657
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,280
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

658
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,240
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

659
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,120
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

660
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
I will join the meeting as well.

661
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,320
But of course,
you must come as well, Elizabeth.

662
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,480
By the way, I really don't like
"Lizzie".

663
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,440
I prefer Liberated Elizabeth.
She must be part of this.

664
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,800
She's been all the way to Paris, so
she is a woman of the world. Bravo.

665
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,200
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you.

666
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,400
CLINKING

667
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,360
Only three, because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

668
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,600
Our friend in Berlin doesn't either.

669
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,440
They have that in common at least.

670
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,960
Oh, I imagine they have lots
in common.

671
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,440
Report to me, Shelby.

672
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,920
Officially Jack Nelson is in London
to buy import licences.

673
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,720
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

674
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,560
Well, as you can see from this
private letter,

675
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,120
he is far from a neutral
point of view.

676
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,800
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

677
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,760
"Individually Jews are fine
but as a race they stink."

678
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,040
Hm. Elizabeth, do you even know
why the bridge

679
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,000
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

680
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920
Actually, no.

681
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,040
I don't really know much about this
business at all.

682
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,040
But I have fucked
your future husband.

683
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,160
So, I know lots of things about him.

684
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Tommy, I'll be outside.

685
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,600
Well done, Elizabeth.

686
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,360
TOMMY CLEARS THROAT

687
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,960
Do you people want to meet Nelson
or no?

688
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,560
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

689
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,120
If you like.

690
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,600
Of course we would.

691
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,440
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

692
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,240
But, Mr Shelby, before this
enterprise goes any further,

693
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,320
you really must do
something about your wife.

694
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,080
# There ain't no grave

695
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,680
# Can hold my body down

696
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,120
# Oh

697
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,960
# Oh. #

698
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,080
Mr Shelby.

699
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,480
Yes.

700
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,080
Mr Nelson.

701
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,320
I came early.

702
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,840
I wanted to come and take a look
around this beautiful church.

703
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,040
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

704
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,880
I hoped that by suggesting we meet
in church it might make us both

705
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,320
more cautious with lies and truth.

706
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,440
Well, your hope would be forlorn.

707
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,440
There ain't no-one listening here.
You don't believe in God?

708
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,240
No.

709
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,560
It was the way Catholics were
treated in my country

710
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,600
that made me angry.

711
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,680
Made me what I became.

712
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,880
What made you angry?

713
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,720
Slowness in anything.

714
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,840
I wanted to have everything already.

715
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,000
Two working-class Catholic boys.

716
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,840
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

717
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,280
Some man in the shadows.

718
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,160
I carried a screwdriver and a blade.

719
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,880
And everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

720
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,560
And do you?

721
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,480
Yes, I do.

722
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,640
First man I killed was a priest.

723
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,840
You?

724
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,040
A Prussian boy with green eyes,
he was already underground.

725
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,720
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

726
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,720
Four years ago.

727
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,440
His name was Tommy Shelby.

728
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,560
He drank whisky.

729
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,680
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

730
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,360
and deal narcotics that will
kill people?

731
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,960
You deal in whisky, Mr Nelson.

732
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,600
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

733
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,280
which said that whisky
disproportionately kills

734
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,080
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

735
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,440
whereas opium is the sedative

736
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,440
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

737
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,600
In return, there are people in
England who you think I should meet?

738
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,480
Yes. Yes, like minds.

739
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,960
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

740
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,640
The booze of the blue blood elite.

741
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,680
In America, we like...

742
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,240
..we like labels and aspiration.

743
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,720
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

744
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,800
You can add that to your portfolio.

745
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,200
I hear Shelby labels are favoured
by the working class.

746
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,240
Indeed.
A fact of which I am very proud.

747
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,720
They say you are a poet, too.

748
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
No, I only read it.

749
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,040
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

750
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,840
Fascists.

751
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,280
Not the ones in boots and black
shirts. The ones in tuxedos.

752
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,720
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

753
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,280
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

754
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,760
For many years now,

755
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,760
I have been working closely with
Winston Churchill,

756
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,640
in many different capacities.

757
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,960
I have his trust.

758
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,360
He's opposed to the rise of fascism.

759
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,360
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

760
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,360
Well, I can give you men
of influence who support your cause.

761
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,360
I can also offer you a full report
on Churchill's strategies.

762
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,840
All this in return for access
to south Boston.

763
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,600
Alternatively,

764
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,120
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

765
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,400
without my intelligence.

766
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,960
And I can sell my opium to the Jews.

767
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,960
You are a brave man, Mr Shelby.

768
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
A war hero, I hear.

769
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,560
Every war hero I ever met,
they're just someone

770
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,720
who wanted to get themselves killed.

771
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,560
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

772
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,120
I'll think a great deal about
what you've said.

773
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,960
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

774
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,520
Ruby?

775
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,040
Ruby?

776
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,840
Ruby?

777
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,200
Ruby?

778
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,640
What are you doing, love?

779
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,480
I can hear voices.

780
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,880
Coming from up the chimney.

781
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,040
What voices? The grey man.

782
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
Gentlemen, Mr Thomas Shelby.

783
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,640
Birmingham South.

784
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,960
THEY HECKLE

785
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,160
Mr Speaker.

786
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,800
I was raised in a family

787
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,720
that endured living conditions
that would test

788
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,960
the morality of even
the most virtuous.

789
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,600
Indeed... Indeed, even the best of
us would have our virtues trounced

790
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,160
and thwarted by life in the meanness

791
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,160
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

792
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,680
What would you know about virtue?
THEY HECKLE

793
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,160
Quickly, please.

794
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,120
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

795
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,720
a bill which will offer radical
reform in housing in this country,

796
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,640
in which slums are cleared
and new houses are built

797
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,960
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

798
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,520
Westminster 245. House of Commons.

799
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,360
PHONE RINGS

800
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,480
The time has come for change, the
people have had enough. They have!

801
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,760
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

802
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,280
build a new Jerusalem
brick by Government-owned brick.

803
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,640
THEY CHEER

804
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,720
Into there.
SHE COUGHS

805
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,320
Doctor?

806
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,680
Yeah, Westminster 245.

807
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,840
Mr Shelby.

808
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,640
DISTORTED: Tickner Maura O Beng,
O Beng over and over again.

809
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,200
How is the family?
And one of you will die.

810
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,760
They are staring at me, Daddy.
A man with green eyes.

811
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,000
Can you stop the voices?

812
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,320
There are no voices, my love.

813
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,880
It's the grey man.

814
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,360
He says he's coming for me...

815
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,440
..and he's coming for Daddy as well.

816
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,880
LOUD BLAST

817
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,040
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

818
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,600
DISTORTED SIGH

Argh!

827
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,920
SQUELCHING
THEY GRUNT

828
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,040
LOUD THUD
Argh!

829
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,360
CRESCENDO OF NOISE

830
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,600
DULL THUDS

831
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,160
METALLIC CLANG

MUFFLED KNOCKING

834
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,480
MUFFLED: Mr Shelby. Is everything
all right in there?

835
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,480
KNOCKING
Mr Shelby?

836
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,040
Everything's fine.

837
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,720
Everything's fine.

PHONE RINGS

839
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,800
Hello? Tommy.

840
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,800
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

841
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,320
Just get here now. Lizzie. Please.

842
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,120
Lizzie.

843
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,760
HE SIGHS

844
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,200
Where is she?
She's with the doctor upstairs.

845
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,320
Listen, Tommy.

846
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,800
He said we shouldn't come close
to her, in case...

847
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,800
In case of what?

848
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,800
When she coughs, there's blood.

849
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,680
Madonna,

850
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,240
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.

851
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,200
# On a gathering storm

852
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,320
# Comes a tall handsome man

853
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,200
# In a dusty black coat

854
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,640
# With a red right hand

855
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,080
# A shadow is cast
wherever he stands

856
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,000
# Stacks of green paper

857
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,040
# In his red right hand. #
