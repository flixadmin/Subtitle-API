Well, the Speed Force
is definitely fixed

00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,607
because the loft did not
look like this a second ago.

00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,066
You like it?

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,901
I love it.

9
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:30,740
Like the trip to Maui yesterday,

10
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,826
and the fresh crepes
this morning from Paris.

[Arielle] After Mirror Monarch's
brutal attack

18
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,796
on Central City last week,

construction areas
like the one behind me

20
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,758
have popped up all over the city.

21
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:35,013
<i>Volunteers from local businesses
and everyday citizens</i>

<i>And here's the person
we've been waiting for,</i>

<i>the hero of Central City, the Flash.</i>

25
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:49,235
An earthquake hit Central City
last night.

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,903
A city already on edge.

27
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:52,655
How is morale?

28
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,825
Well, the sign says it all.

29
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,909
Central City Strong.

<i>But I will make it up to you.</i>

<i>I promise.</i>

34
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:14,260
Together we're rebuilding
our community,

00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:16,971
our homes, our lives.

Wow. Flash's speech has me wanting
to sign up for double shifts today.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,671
Yeah, he knows
what the people need to hear

45
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:50,838
to get back on our feet.

46

Yo, this is epic.

47
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,237
I didn't know S.T.A.R. Labs
did volunteer work.

Mm-hm. And not just us.

49
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,784
Kord Industries is showing up
for their shift in an hour.

Hey, you got any more nails?

51
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,936
Yeah. I got your box nail,
finishing nail,

52
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,063
casing nail, masonry nail...
All the nails.

- [Caitlin] Whew!

54
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,131
You got a latte in there?
Because I'm as fried as these wires.

55
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,569
Oh. Runkadelic,

56
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,922
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

57
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,447
- Yeah, we gotta...
- Jitters run.

58
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,158
Jitters run. I like Jitters.
We should do Jitters.

59
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,451
One latte coming right up.

60
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,535

You okay?

63
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,377
After our fight with Eva,
I have just been exhausted.

64
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,920
And now I've got this headache.

65
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:33,207
You need to recharge.
Can't you just, like, frost out?

66
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,549
No, not out here.

67
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,926
You and I know she's reformed,

68
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,926
but technically,

69
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,947
there's still a warrant out
for Killer Frost's arrest.

Who's that?

72
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,562
Iris. Wants notes
on a <i>Citizen</i> article.

73
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,415
Kamilla's been spending all her time

74
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,274
photographing the destruction
in the city.

75
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,276
It's great that she's so inspired,

76
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,446
but now I'm the only one
that can give Iris any feedback.

77
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,885
Maybe I'll stay here a little longer.

78
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,307
It sounds like you're avoiding her.

79
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,870
Fine. I'm going.

80
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,167
[sighs]

81
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,259
- Hey, got your texts.
- Great.

82
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,342
Sorry to drag you away,

83
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,303
but I need those notes
on the Mirrorverse article.

84
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,222
We need to go to press ASAP.

85
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,224
Online viewership is down 73%,

86
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:28,060
and I think that my article
could be what <i>The Citizen</i> needs

87
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,584
to pull us out of the financial hole
that Mirror Me put us in.

88
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,399
- Ooh. Did you get me a T-shirt?
- Yes.

89
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,862
Thanks. Cute.

90
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,449
Okay, so stop burying the lede.
Tell me what you think.

91
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,699
Good, huh?

92
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:47,121
Well, it was really well-written.

00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,015
Okay, come on.
Pretend you're my editor.

94
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,208
Lay it on me.

95
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,294
It stinks, okay?

96
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,425
This part about the explosion
at McCulloch Tech

97
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,385
is straight out of CCPN's report.

98

This section on Eva's
framing of Sue Dearbon

99
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,808
was already covered to death
by CC News Network.

100
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,935
And was this quote
from that Maurice guy

101
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,144
even fact-checked?

102
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,273
Okay. Is there anything else?

103
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:15,899
Yeah.

104
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,420
You were in the Mirrorverse
the longest

105
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,320
and knew Eva the best.

106
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,447
You're the expert.

107
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,033
So where's anything
about your experience?

108

'Cause what's missing
from this is you.

This time you're both.

111
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,457
Look...

112
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,588
There are people out there
just like you

113
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,883
who wish they hadn't been
a part of this story.

114
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:42,927
But they were.

115
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,847
You're their voice, so try again.

116
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:48,850
For them.

Who the hell are you?

119
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,215
I'm the greatest magician
of all time.

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,427
Which is why you should
be more than just afraid.

121
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,891
You should be terrified.

122
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,604
Boo.

123
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,148
[man screaming]

00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,495
Abracadabra.

125
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,717
Now for my greatest trick yet.

126
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,014
Absolute suffering.

127
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,441
I feel like usually I'd be like

128
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:25,655
"Holy Arthur C. Clarke,"
but it's just so cute.

129
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,156
Mm, don't let it fool you.

130
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,661
It may be collectible size,
but this little guy is heavy.

131
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,412
Two tons?

132
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:37,124
That's like 20 baby elephants.
Which is also kinda cute.

133
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,335
I mean, what do you think
this thing's made of?

134
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,922
And how does a shed just disappear?
None of it makes any sense.

135
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,177
Barry, I know
this all seems bad, but...

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,845
Chester, this city's
been through hell.

137
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,890
Can't take another emergency.
Not now. Not this soon.

138
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,810
- We got this, Barr, don't worry.
- We just started rebuilding.

139
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,397
I'm not gonna let anything
tear us down again.

140
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:03,859
Please tell me you boys
found something we can use.

141
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,565
[Cisco] I think I just did.

142
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,321
It looks like this whole crime scene

143
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,574
is infected with
serious temporal energy.

144
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:14,870
Like the kind carbon-dated
43 centuries from now.

145
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,415
[Chester] As in the future?

146
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,625
Wait, hold on.
Is this thing like a time capsule?

147
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,918
Or maybe like a TARDIS?

148
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,795
P. Runk, you picked a hell of a day

149
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,214
to start your CCPD
consultant internship.

150
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,967
Yeah, this is definitely
a time traveler.

151
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,385
[Chester laughs excitedly]

152
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,054
Barr, there's something
you need to see.

153
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,100
He's not just a time traveler.

154
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:42,231
He's a guy who has
a theatrical flair for killing.

155
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,861
Abra Kadabra is back.

156
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,488
[sighs] Oh, great.

157
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,741
That explains all the shaking
and quaking yesterday.

158
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,285
Wait, Timequakes, too?

159
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,122
Oh. Okay, so what's
this Abra dude's deal?

160
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,083
Oh, you know, he's just your
standard time traveling,

00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,838
who uses embedded nanotech
and calls it magic.

163
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,733
[Barry] Four years ago,
the Collectors Agency

164
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,884
took him to be executed
for his crimes.

165
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,677
Somehow he escaped.

166
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,763
Last time, he was hellbent
on stealing tech

167
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:14,889
to build a time machine.

168
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,640
This time he goes out of his way

169
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,977
to kill an innocent person,
doesn't steal a thing.

170
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,563
That's a pretty vicious escalation.

171
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,583
And what's that thing back there
got to do with it?

172
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,523
[Barry] You know,
it doesn't matter.

173
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,164
Kadabra picked the wrong day
to come back.

174
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,433
I'll put out a BOLO right away.

175
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,173
You wanna help me analyze
some of this stuff?

176
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,281
I'll search the city.

177
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,913
Central City Strong.

178
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,004
[Stephen] When I was inside
that other place,

179
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,132
I watched that mirror version of me

180
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,303
spend time with my wife.

181
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,349
They ate meals together,
talked about their day.

182
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,936
I remember screaming,
"That's not me,"

183
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,019
but I was helpless.

184
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,482
Barry! That's not me!
That's not me!

185
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,819
[Stephen] I thought everything
would be okay once I was back.

186
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,194
It's not.

187
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:16,743
I'm trying so hard
to get back to normal.

188
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,161
I'm trying so hard to be fine.

189
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:23,791
But the truth is that things
are not normal and I am not fine.

190
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,962
And I won't be for a long time.

191
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,507
Thank you so much
for coming and listening.

192
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,821
Stephen, Alice,
thank you for agreeing

193
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,012
to do this interview with me.

194
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,764
Are you sure I'm not intruding?

195
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,975
Of course not.
We're all in this together.

196
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,102
Central City Strong.

197
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,521
Yeah. [clears throat]

198
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,525
Um, are you all right?

199
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,986
You seem upset.

200
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,488
Me? No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

201
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,116
Were you abducted as well?

202
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,910
[gasps]

203
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,373
You know, if you ever want
to sit in with the group...

204
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,833
No, I'm fine, thank you.

205
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,376
You don't seem like it.

206
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,214
Yeah, I just... I have a deadline
for another article.

207
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,592
Do you mind if we reschedule?

208
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,136
- Sure, no problem.
- Thanks.

209
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,724
[breath trembling]

210
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,522
We could do release date order...

211
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,400
Or machete order...

212
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,445
- Prequels after <i>Empire?</i>
- [Chester laughs]

213
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,071
You're a wild man and I love it.

214
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:39,200
- Then the Jedi Council has spoken.
- It has!

215
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,473
Get anything
on your scans over there?

216
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,121
[clattering]

217
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,123
[sighs] No.

218
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,265
Think it might be time
for a Jitters run.

219
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,587
Well, thank God,
'cause Chester P. is running on E.

220
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,190
- [rapid beeping]
- Hold the cappuccino.

221
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,548
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

222
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,259
That's the same temporal scan
from this morning.

223
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,887
Only now there's a second one
downtown, which means...

224
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,597
That's where Kadabra's headed next.

225
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,436
Two is always deadlier than one.

226
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,529
Flash.

227
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,200
- I knew it was just a matter of time.
- Bad timing for you, Kadabra.

228
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,411
[Vibe] Yeah, those would be
nanotech nullifying cuffs.

229
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,872
So no hocus pocus this time.

230
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,083
Hey, what's up
with all your new toys?

231
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,335
A magician never reveals his secrets.

232
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,547
- I see you're finally Mecha-Vibe.
- Mecha-Vibe?

233
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,091
I know he did not just name me.

234
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,302
I know more than just your name.
I've seen your future.

235
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
[Barry] It's over.

236
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,139
- You've lost.
- Have I?

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,726
Seems you've forgotten
the art of misdirection.

238
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,646
Ah.

239
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,938
Oh, shoot.

240
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,405
You know what? I'm doing you a favor
by killing you now, Flash.

241
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:04,285
This way you'll never have to face
the wrath of the Chronarch.

242
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,746
Alas, you can't run forever.

243
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,838
What was that you were saying
about the art of misdirection?

244
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,269
Look at me. I'm A.R.G.U.S.

245
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,479
I'm gonna let two young,
handsome devils

246
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,606
do all the work
while I reap all the benefits.

247
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,443
And I'm going to pick up
the obelisks. That doesn't bug you?

248
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,736
Kadabra's caught.

249
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,419
The job's finished. You really
want to argue over who gets credit?

250
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:42,990
Yes.

251
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,117
[clangs]

252
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,077
No.

253
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,246
I just want to know what the plan is.

254
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,473
All right, knock yourself out.

255
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,249
I got to do something
important for Iris.

256
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,710
Hm.

257
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,795
Hey! Hold up there, chief.

258
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,216
My classification is

259
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,927
Director of Technology and Science
for A.R.G.U.S.

260
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,096
I've never held the rank of chief.

261
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,016
Okay. Hey, I just want to know
what your plan is

262
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,518
for keeping David Copperfield
here contained.

263
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,481
David Copperfield is not currently
under A.R.G.U.S.' custody.

264
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,024
Are you for real right now?

265
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,901
If you're asking if I'm a hologram,

266
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,696
I can neither confirm nor deny
A.R.G.U.S.' use of such tactics.

267
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,747
Oh, you just missed Lieutenant Literal.

268
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,457
Where were you?
Hiding from A.R.G.U.S.?

269
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,125
No, A.R.G.U.S and I are cool.

270
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,418
They know I'm innocent.

271
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,382
I was trying to get rid
of this stupid headache.

272
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,549
But look what I liberated from one
of the transport guards.

273
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,551
Ice ice bandit. What is it?

274
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,551
I don't know,

275
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,680
but it was on Abra Kadabra
when they took him down.

276
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,563
Maybe it has something
to do with the obelisk.

277
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,682
- Yeah, maybe...
- Uh-uh.

278
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,603
Before you nerd out completely,
I need a favor.

279
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,568
What's wrong with me?

280
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:05,863
So much.

281
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,742
I'm kidding.

282
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,743
You're fine.

283
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,498
Every dark matter reading I'm seeing
is completely normal.

284
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,724
What does Caitlin have to say?

285
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,250
She says it's just a headache.

286
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,918
Hm. She's probably right.

287
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:19,502
[Caitlin] <i>I told you so.</i>

288
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,755
I know something is off.

289
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,256
[Caitlin]
<i>We can't find anything.</i>

290
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,483
Well, then look somewhere else.

291
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,300
I don't know
what else you want me to do.

292
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,094
Sorry, that was yelling at Caity.

293
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,305
Yeah. Okay. I'm going to let you two
work this out.

294
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,519
Chester and I are going to break open
Abra Kadabra's mysterious tech-cuff.

295
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,451
Missing those fancy trophies?

296
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,158
What's that? You're still looking
for the third one?

297
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,414
It's already here.

298
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,874
Picked it up last week.

299
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,793
Hey, keep it moving, Houdini.

300
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,165
What are you trying to pull?

301
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,424
Nothing.

302
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:07,967
It's already done.

303
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:14,808
[automated voice speaking]

304
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:15,892
<i>Access granted.</i>

305
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,363
And then there were three.

306
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,292
- Hey, save your work.
- Hey.

307
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,835
You can finish writing

308
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,796
in the beach villa
I just rented us in Monaco.

309
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,552
Oh. You mean leave right now?

310
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,806
Yeah. For a romantic villa in Monaco.

311
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,806
Barry.

312
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,519
Look, you're working.
I get that that's important.

313
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,980
But you were just staring
at a blank screen when I...

314
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,649
- Fathwoomed in.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,235
And you know what's great
when you're stuck?

316
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,570
Clearing your head in Monaco.

317
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,113
Cool breeze,

318
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,699
waves crashing on the white sand.

319
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,620
Barry, we have traveled the globe
nonstop all this past week.

320
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,080
Yeah, 'cause you deserve the best.

321
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,249
Are you okay?

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,958
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...

323
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,520
I'm trying to sweep
my wife off her feet

324
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,671
for a romantic getaway.

325
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,798
Which I appreciate, but...

326
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,884
Iris, sweetie, please just let me
make this up to you. Please.

327
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,514
I'm sorry. I'm just...

328
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,225
All right, you know what? No.
I'll think of something else.

329
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,273
Yeah. Yes.

330
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,025
Yeah. Let's go.

331
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,527
- Really?
- Yeah.

332
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,780
Yeah. Zoop me to paradise.

333
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,574
Don't you wanna pack your laptop?

334
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,535
Uh... No. You know what?
I need to take a break.

335
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,788
You're right. Surf and sand
sounds perfect right now.

336
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,290
[phone vibrating]

337
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,336
Kadabra's just escaped custody.
He's loose somewhere in A.R.G.U.S.

338
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,590
Go. Go!

339
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,552
[sighs]

340
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,601
[grunts]

341
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,895
Stand down. It's your last chance.

342
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,315
Flash being ruthless. I like it.

343
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,194
As much as I enjoy
the stink of desperation on you,

344
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,487
I'm afraid you're too late.

345
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,657
You're trapped
in a constrictive metallic halo.

346
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,951
The more you try to escape,
the tighter it gets.

347
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,871
So please try to escape.

348
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:47,044
The last time we met, you begged me
to find a glimmer of light in myself.

349
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,672
Well, I found that light,
that hope...

350
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,383
and then you stole it from me.

351
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,220
Now I'm going to take
something from you.

352
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,531
I don't know
what you're talking about.

353
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,683
Let me make it
crystal clear for you, Flash.

354
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,354
You cannot defeat a man
who has lost everything.

355
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,528
[The Flash] What are you doing?

356
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,531
[Abra Kadabra] Creating a masterpiece.

357
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,635
Now, for my last trick...

358
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,473
I'm going to make your whole city...

359
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,517
disappear.

360
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,148
[grunts]

361
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,078
Do we have eyes on Kadabra?

362
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,579
Yes and no.

363
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,541
He's teleporting all over the city
with that obelisk ball thing.

364
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm scanning.

365
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,002
We're picking up readings
of anti-matter energy.

366
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,462
[rapid beeping]

367
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,549
He created an anti-matter bomb.

368
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,094
That kind of power,
it could take out another Earth.

369
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,137
Or another universe.

370
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,514
Wait, what?
Are we about to have Crisis part two?

371
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,142
No, no. There's not enough
anti-matter energy for that,

372
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,268
thank the sequel gods.

373
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:30,397
But the core is roughly
the size of a baseball.

374
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,775
A baseball? Barry, a trace amount
nearly took out your leg.

375
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,610
Is it enough to destroy the city?

376
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,821
I'd say there's exactly enough.

377
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,199
Abra said his last trick
was to make the whole city disappear.

378
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,287
Destroying Central City
must be his plan.

379
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,123
- But why now?
- [Chester] I don't know. But guys...

380
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,834
Every time he teleports,
that bomb gains kinetic energy.

381
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,794
I think he's charging it.

382
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:56,047
And if I'm reading this right,
his bomb's already at 47%.

383
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,216
At this rate, it'll be fully charged
within the hour.

384
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,760
Okay, what do we do?

385
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,487
There's got to be a way
to disarm it, right?

386
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,221
I could use one of
my Atlantean plug-ins

387
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,640
to analyze the bomb's outer hull,
determine its density,

388
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,601
see if you can phase
through its surface...

389
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,896
and disarm it.

390
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,355
That's not your happy face.

391
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,857
[sighs]

392
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:18,361
The bomb is made of the same material
as the obelisks.

393
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,488
Pure Valorium.

394
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,241
[Chester] An Nth metal alloy? Not good.

395
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,161
It's impenetrable to anything
but the anti-matter itself.

396
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,789
Which means you can't access
the core and disarm it.

397
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,165
So no phasing.

398
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,251
Even if we could figure out
a way to catch Kadabra,

399
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,587
his teleportation pattern
is completely randomized.

400
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,255
So there's no way to catch him

401
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,509
until he stops moving
and detonates the bomb.

402
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,059
I should have known
Kadabra was up to something

403
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,255
when we caught him so easily.

404
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,058
He wanted to be in A.R.G.U.S.

405
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,229
We helped him get
the last piece of that weapon.

406
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,523
I just let it happen.

407
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,358
Barry, it's gonna be okay.

408
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,527
How? He has anti-matter,

409
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,821
the most dangerous substance
in existence.

410
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,465
And now,
if we can't figure something out,

411
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,075
the entire city,
millions of lives will be lost.

412
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,370
Because I got tricked. Again.

413
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,596
Hey.

414
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,057
You okay?

415
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,351
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,146
I'm just...
struggling with everything lately.

417
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,318
I tried to find you and...

418
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,863
Cisco told me what happened.

419
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,660
What did you mean when you
said that you were tricked again?

420
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,956
From the very first moment
that imposter walked into our home,

421
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,124
I should have seen it.

422
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,252
I should have known
that she wasn't you.

423
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,170
[sighs]

424
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,966
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

425
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,344
What happened with Mirror Iris
is not your fault.

426
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,889
Then whose fault was it?

427
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,058
I'm the one that didn't realize
I was living with a stranger.

428
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,103
And if I had, not only could
we have brought you back sooner,

429
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,522
maybe we could have stopped
Eva before she attacked

430
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,606
and the whole city
wouldn't be suffering right now.

431
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:24,195
When we got married,
I promised to always be by your side.

432
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,697
And I wasn't.

433
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,825
And I know it's stupid to think

434
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,413
if I buy you enough flowers
or make you the perfect dessert,

435
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,696
that's going to make up
for what I did, 'cause it won't.

436
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,961
But honestly,
I don't know what else to do.

437
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,672
Barry, you don't have to do anything.

438
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,926
You've got me,
and I'm never gonna leave.

439
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,762
And I need you to hear me
on this, okay?

440
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:54,476
Something terrible happened to you,
not because of you.

441
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,019
And that kind of trauma,

442
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,896
that doesn't go away
in a day or a week.

443
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,022
You have to...

444
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,691
[sighs]...face it.

445
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,697
Mirror Iris took
the best part of you,

446
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:11,159
your heart, and she used it
as a weapon against you.

447
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,495
She lied to you.

448
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,914
Being emotionally manipulated

449
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:19,125
by someone everything in your being
tells you to trust?

450
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,712
That is not your fault.

451
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,927
Every time I think
I couldn't possibly love you more...

452
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,062
You have a family, friends,
people that you care about.

453
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,023
Somewhere inside of you,

454
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,943
there must be a glimmer of light,
of hope.

455
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,530
Well, I found that light,
that hope...

456
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,116
and then you stole it from me.

457
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,036
- What?
- I know why Abra's doing this.

458
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:04,170
This is what we found embedded inside
Abra's annoyingly secure tech-cuff.

459
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,922
It's a Martian Memory Restorer.

460
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,972
It helps people get their pre-Crisis
memories back with a single touch.

461
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,051
How do you know that?

462
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,888
- 'Cause Cisco designed it.
- Whoa. But why?

463
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,267
So Laurel Lance and Mia Queen...

464
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,414
Okay, you know what?
It's not important.

465
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,438
The important thing is

466
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:26,651
I think Kadabra stole the MMR
in the future

467
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,447
and something in those pre-Crisis
memories brought him here.

468
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,842
So the reason he wants to
blow up the city could be in there.

469
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,410
Even if it is, it doesn't matter.
We don't have time to find it.

470
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,579
I mean, the human brain
is essentially capable

471
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,664
of storing trillions of bytes
of memories.

472
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,750
It would take us years
to find the one we need.

473
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,001
No, it won't.

474
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,046
I know how to stop Abra.

475
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,346
[Chester] <i>Flash, Kadabra stopped
at Tagaloa Plaza.</i>

476
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,188
Perfect timing, Flash.

477
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,231
You're just in time to witness

478
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,984
the complete annihilation
of Central City.

479
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,071
Now you'll finally understand
what it's like

480
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,114
when everything you love dies.

481
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,409
You were right, Kadabra.
We can't defeat you.

482
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,661
Which is why I'm not gonna try.

483
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,877
What happens if this doesn't work?

484
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,837
Then it's game over.

485
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,801
Trying to pull a trick of your own?
I wouldn't.

486
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,678
Your 21st-century brain
comes in a distant second

487
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,639
to my 64th-century intellect.

488
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,014
No, no tricks.

489
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:40,849
Just listen.

490
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,853
I know why you're doing this.

491
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,981
I know why you're hurting.

492
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,859
You don't know a damn thing about me.

493
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,570
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

494
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,573
I also know killing innocent people
isn't the answer.

495
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,534
And it's not gonna change anything.

496
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,745
Destructions is the ultimate catalyst
for change.

497
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,622
See, people in my century
understand that.

498
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,249
You may be from the future...

499
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,212
but the reason that you're here?
You're trying to change the past.

500
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,506
No, leave that alone.

501
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,184
This is your family
from another timeline.

502
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,311
Only they're gone now, aren't they?

503
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,646
Thirteen months ago,

504
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,817
I started having dreams
of a life I never lived.

505
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,652
One where I was so...

506
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,613
happy.

507
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,242
I had to know what was causing them.

508
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:44,247
I ran every test on myself possible
using 64th-century technology.

509
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,292
What I found was
that somehow I'd experienced

510
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,003
a sudden increase
in my somatic memory cells.

511
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,754
Your memories were expanding.

512
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,009
More backwards 21st-century thinking.

513
00:27:57,218 --> 00:28:00,930
I'd been exposed
to neuro-temporal displacement.

514
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,685
The kind that's created
when Speedsters disrupt time.

515
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:11,232
With my clue for the cause,
it led me to the Flash Museum.

516
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,196
You're obsessed
with the future, Flash.

517
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,742
Not now, but... oh, you will be.

518
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,453
I found so many
interesting things there,

519
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,038
including, to my surprise,

520
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:29,042
Cisco Ramon's archaic memory device.

521
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,377
<i>It was damaged beyond repair.
I fixed it easily.</i>

522
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,921
Ugh. This guy sucks.

523
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,925
You used it on yourself
and it gave you those memories back.

524
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,093
From a time before
everything changed.

525
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,846
With my memories restored,

526
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,225
I had proof
that the family from my dreams,

527
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,520
a wife and son
that I never knew existed, were real.

528
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:56,027
They were erased from existence
by what you did.

529
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:01,282
You were supposed to vanish
in your Crisis, Flash, not them.

530
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,579
But when you didn't,
my future changed.

531
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,789
They ceased to exist.

532
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,500
And I lost everything,
just like you will now.

533
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:11,918
Wait!

534
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,461
[powering up]

535
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,066
- [rapid beeping]
- Kadabra's weapon is 97% charged.

536
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,299
We have less than 90 seconds.

537
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,676
You can do this, Barry.

538
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,388
Crisis destroyed countless lives.

539
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,267
And yes, some of us survived.

540
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,477
It's not fair.

541
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,731
Now we have to carry on
for those who didn't.

542
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,609
I lost someone, too.

543
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,238
He was like a brother to me.

544
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,908
And ever since,
I've tried to honor his sacrifice.

545
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,996
You can do the same for your family.

546
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,166
I'm betting
you already tried to go back

547
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,252
before Crisis started
and you couldn't, right?

548
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,007
That's because that past
is from a multi-versal world

549
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,550
that no longer exists.

550
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,804
Killing me won't reset the timeline.

551
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,515
- That future is gone...
- Liar!

552
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,434
I will bring them back.

553
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,434
And if I can't,

554
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,895
then I'll take everything from you
the way I lost everything.

555
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,397
My pain is yours.

556
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,566
That's why you want
to destroy the city.

557
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,819
So you can make people
suffer like you.

558
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,614
Because you already know
killing me won't work.

559
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,824
Shut up.

560
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:26,701
You've run all the calculations.

561
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,578
You can't comprehend what I've done.

562
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,872
Yes, I can. I'm a scientist, too.

563
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:37,712
So tell me, what are the odds
that doing this will bring them back?

564
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,592
Barry, it's about to explode.

565
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,518
I haven't run a calculation
on the timeline yet

566
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,602
where they return.

567
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,940
How would they feel

568
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,485
knowing you annihilated

569
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,321
an entire city in their name?

570
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:11,496
Making other people hurt
won't erase your suffering.

571
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,832
The only way for you to heal

572
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,752
is to face your trauma.

573
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,738
[Allegra] He did it!

574
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,323
Without throwing a single punch.

575
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,826
Yeah. The Flash
doesn't need big fists.

576
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,078
He's got a big heart.

577
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,010
Luca.

578
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,391
That was my son.

579
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,519
Amelie, my wife.

580
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:19,396
And your friend?

581
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,524
His name was Oliver.

582
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,486
My name's Philippe.

583
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,617
What am I supposed to do now?

584
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,245
I can't go on without them.

585
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,457
The people we love never leave us.

586
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,629
Let that love help you
find hope again in this world.

587
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,382
I don't get it.

588
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,260
We're mortal enemies in the future.

589
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,678
Why are you doing this?

590
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:55,016
So the next time we meet,
maybe we won't be.

591
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,526
Fair enough.

592
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,321
[rumbling]

593
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:12,366
This isn't me.

594
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:13,993
[rapid beeping]

595
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,204
I'm picking up
enough seismic activity

596
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,830
to rattle us back to the Stone Age.

597
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,082
Detecting a massive biosignature.

598
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,726
Barry, whatever's causing
these tremors,

599
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:22,951
it's headed right towards you.

600
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,178
Barry!

601
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,306
[roaring]

602
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:43,813
Barry, get up.

603
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,483
<i>Get up, Barry.</i>

604
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,822
You are an ugly one.

605
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,496
I've got this, Flash.

606
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,541
Stand down, beautiful...

607
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,460
or I'll use every ounce
of this anti-matter bomb

608
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:05,878
to blow you to kingdom come.

609
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,686
[roaring]

610
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,605
That's impossible.

611
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,524
[rapid beeping]

612
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,197
Fine, let's see
how you like this trick.

613
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,124
[clattering]

614
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,374
Philippe?

615
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,467
What have you done?

616
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:54,885
[roars]

617
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,388

[groans]

620
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,323
Barry!

621
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,968
[Caitlin] Respiratory distress,
elevated blood pressure.

622
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:18,992
He's crashing.

623
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,120
- [bones cracking]
- [groans]

[roars]

625
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,628
[Barry] Philippe was trying to heal,

626
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,483
just like the rest of us.

627
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,111
This isn't right.

628
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,364
He died a hero.

629
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,574
That means something.

630
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,117
What was that thing anyway?

631
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,286
Death itself, maybe.

632
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,123
Whatever it was,

633
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,878
it absorbed the full power
of an anti-matter bomb.

634
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,421
- That means it's...
- Unstoppable.

635
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,677
But hey, you're...

636
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:19,970
You're okay, right?

637
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,389
[phone vibrating]

638
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,724
Yeah. Yeah, since we rebooted
the Speed Force,

639
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,184
I'm faster than ever.

640
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,352
So's my speed healing.

641
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,603
Thank goodness.

642
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,939
Great. The brass are dumping

643
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:34,568
a liaison from the Governor's Police
Compliance Commission in my lap.

644
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:39,073
I got to go figure out
how to explain all this to her.

645
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:43,160
Well, I have lots of meta-clients
that need my legal expertise.

646
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,787
How about I drop you at the station?

647
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,421
So what do we do now?

648
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:54,714
Same thing we always do.

649
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,925
Get to work stopping that thing
before it kills again.

650
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,849
Allegra... [clears throat]

651
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,145
What you said about my article...

652
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:14,191
If you're going to say I came off
kinda harsh, you're not the first.

653
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,193
I'm glad you told me
what I needed to hear.

654
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,323
But it's still hard to take
from an intern.

655
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,994
Which is why I'm making you
a staff writer.

656
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,122
Wait. You're what?

657
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,165
Congratulations.

658
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,332
You earned it.

659
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,626
Thanks, boss.

660
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,716
You're amazing.

661
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,677
You helped me
get through to Philippe,

662
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:42,762
and that saved the city.

663
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,597
It's called teamwork.

664
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,349
We're Barry and Iris.

665
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,311
It's the strongest superpower
there is.

666
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,191
So I was thinking tonight
maybe we just go home,

667
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,901
have a normal dinner,

668
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,028
maybe eat a frozen pizza
on the couch?

669
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,905
Sounds perfect.

670
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:02,989
But...

671
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,784
Nothing, I just...

672
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,994
I was thinking of something
I have to do tomorrow.

673
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,622
Come on, let's go.

674
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:16,753
Hi.

675
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,633
Um...

676
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,762
I am no stranger to trauma,

677
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,225
but when Eva McCulloch
threatened our city, I was...

678
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:36,315
taken against my will
to a terrifying place.

679
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,484
A place that you all know.

680
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:45,533
Somewhere filled
with loneliness and dread,

681
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,744
the same dread
that you all felt, too.

682
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:54,625
And that is where I spent
the next three months.

683
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,380
Three months where I couldn't be
with my loved ones.

684
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,884
And yes, I feel...

685
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,889
angry, and I feel...

686
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,352
sorry for myself, and I hate
that I feel both of those things,

687
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,773
and I wish that all of that
was yesterday's pain

688
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:21,735
and that today I could feel
healed and whole.

689
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:26,407
But I now understand
that I can't heal

690
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,079
if I don't allow myself permission
to feel what I'm feeling.

691
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,170
What happened to us...

692
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,424
was not right.

693
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,887
And...

694
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:52,141
if you are hurting,
if you feel angry,

695
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,437
if the constant presence of those
emotions is exhausting you...

696
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,566
you are not alone.

697
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,111
I am with you.

698
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:06,864
You know, my dad once said that

699
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,451
there is as much beauty in this life
as there is pain.

700
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,202
You just have to look for it.

701
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,248
But most of all...

702
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,049
we have to look for it
within each other.

703
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,929
And that's gonna take some time.

704
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,683
But it is time
that we can spend together.

705
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,064
[sighs]

706
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,397
Thank you.

707
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,235
Thank you.

708
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,374
- Boss, that was...
- Everything that I needed.

709
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,166
Thank you.

710
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,547
Well, I guess you know what
you're gonna say in your article now.

711
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,841
I'm not sure that's big enough.

712
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,011
I think I have to reach people
on a whole different level.

713
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:13,722
I owe them that.

714
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,517
Come on.

715
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,276
- [beeping]
- [sighs]

716
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,154
Chester, if you're going to be
a part of Team Flash,

717
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,615
then you have to stop
beating me at <i>Fortnite.</i>

718
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,119
Cisco. Thank God you're here.

719
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,497
There's something I need to show you.

720
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,443
You still having those headaches?

721
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,666
Nope.

722
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:42,792
Not anymore.

723
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:44,752
Okay. Why...

724
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,173
Hello, Cisco.

725
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,219
How great is this?
