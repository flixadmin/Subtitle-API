He's coming here, to this house, tonight?

44

- That's what I'm telling you.

Mm-hmm.

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,916
I started to ditch science
so I could go and practice guitar,

421
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,166
then I'd change it on the computer.

422
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,666
Makes sense.

423
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,916
There's this girl in jazz band, Piper.

424
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,625
She started to ditch with me,
but then Kevin...

425
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:03,916
Who's Kevin?

426
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,958
My best friend. At least he was.

427
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,375
What'd Kevin do?

428
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,125
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

429
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,750
But he's not even in jazz band.

430
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,458
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

431
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,250
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

432
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,541
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

433
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,041
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

434
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,125
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

435
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,333
Good. Send a message.

436
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,791

437
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,500
Kevin.

438
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

439
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,000
- I know, you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

440
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,041
Look, if you're gonna hack a mainframe,
you do it quietly.

441
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,583
You go in through a back door,
no fingerprints.

442
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,041
But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin

443
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,666
knew what you were doing,
you got a loose end.

444
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,833
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

445
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:53,375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you, 'cause they'll use it.

00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:57,791
Yeah.

447
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,125
All right, I got to go practice.

448
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,208

450
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,166

451
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,125

452

Good luck.

453
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,750

454
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,583

- Yeah, then it did.

455
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,541
Thanks for picking him up, though.

456
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,333
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

457
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,750
Yeah, well, you know, growing up is tough.

458
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,666
Is that why you're avoiding it?

459
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,041

460
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,625

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,666
He told me about school.
I mean, I don't know what...

00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,666
Okay. Um...

483
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,041
First of all, sorry.

484
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:09,041
Second, could you be more specific?

485
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,625
Honestly, you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

486
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,125
Who are you working for?

487
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,833
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

488
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,583
I work for whoever pays me.

489
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,958
You have about 40 seconds

490
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,333
to become helpful
before you have a terrible accident,

491
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,666
so I'm gonna ask you one more time:

492
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,916
Who hired you to find him?

493
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,458
- Find who?
- You know who.

494
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,041
I promise you I don't.

495
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,541
If I did, I would tell you.

496
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,791
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

497
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,875
The Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

498
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,083
Sound familiar?

499
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,958
Yeah. I did that.

500
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,166
It was a weird job.

501
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,250
Somebody was trying to find someone
who was running tests

502
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,208
on some weapons systems
in the arctic, and I...

503
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,375
I found the location, and I walked.

504
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,666
For who?

505
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,041
I don't know.

506
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,208
I'm telling you, all the communication
is encrypted and untraceable.

507
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,958
That's how it's supposed to be

508
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,916
so if someone like you shows up
I don't have any answers.

509
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,458
Look, I don't ask questions.

510
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,750
I just find people
that no one else can find.

511
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,291
It's what I do.

512
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,791
You really don't know what you did.

513
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,166
I guess not.

514
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,458
I mean, I can tell
you're very upset about it, though.

515
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,333
Box him up.

516
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,875
Box me up?

517
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,458
Wait, wait. What do you mean? Hey.

518
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Is this really necessary?

519
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,791
Ow.

520
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,291
Cool place.

521
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,500
How long you been here?

522
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,791
M-O-R-A?

523
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,250
MORA.

524
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,750
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

525
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,333
Come again?

526
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,375
We are the multilateral
international organization

527
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,625
responsible for securing and protecting
the mythological world.

528
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,833
Come with me.

529
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,250
- Did you say "the mythological world"?
- Yes.

530
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,375
Right.

531
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,125
So, uh, bigfoot,

532
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,750
Loch Ness Monster, that kind of thing?

533
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,083
That kind of thing.

534
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,500
Okay, so...

535
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:42,666
things that don't actually exist,
you guys are responsible for.

536
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,041
Got it.

537
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:47,166
Holy shit!

538
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,208
If he knows anything, he ain't talking.

539
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,791
All right. Horse back to the pen,
body back to Area 32.

540
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,916
And get the pumpkin
back in the cryo-vault stat.

541
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,500
Yes, Director.

542
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,125
What the hell was that?

543
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,416
The Horseman.

544
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,958
We're questioning all the usual suspects.

545
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,875
The Headless Horseman?

546
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,666
Hey. What did that
Taser thing do to my head?

547
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,875
It's not a Taser. It's an Acquiescer.

548
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,833
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat, Jack.

549
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,458
What am I doing here?

550
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:54,541
Last night, at roughly 11:00 p.m. NPST,

551
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:58,375
Red One, also known
as Saint Nicholas of Myra,

552
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:01,291
was abducted from the North Pole complex.

553
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,958
The data you retrieved from the I-Triple-S
was used to pinpoint the location,

554
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:12,166
which has been secure and classified
for several hundred years.

555
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,166
Use your words.

556
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,541
Are you saying...

557
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:29,166
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

558
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,708
And you think I had
something to do with it?

559
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,000
Where is he?

560
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,375
Is that him?

561
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:43,041
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley,
meet Callum Drift, commander of the E.L.F.

562
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,541
The E.L.F.?

563
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,291
Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

564
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,500
Somebody hired him to find the complex,
and incredibly, he did.

565
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,916
Who?

566
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,625
- He doesn't know.
- I don't know.

567
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,875
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.

568
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,833
They always know something.

569
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:00,041
Sometimes you just
got to shake it out of 'em.

570
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,125
I'm not gonna like you.

571
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,125
I can tell right away, out of
everyone here, I like you the least.

572
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,625
Garcia.

573
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,958
What the...

574
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,625
Yeah, chief.

575
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,500
- This guy's not cooperating.
- Ah.

576
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,250
Should we do the thing?

577
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,750
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

578
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,666
- Cal, let's talk about this for a minute.
- There's nothing to talk about.

579
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,416
You can't trust this guy.
He's on the list.

580
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

581
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,583
Look, I'm not on any watch list.
I know for a fact that...

582
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,666
Wait a minute.

583
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,833
You don't mean...

584
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,958
Yes, that list. You're on it. I checked.

585
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,791
- NL-Four.
- Are you telling me

586
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:41,041
this clown is a Level Four Naughty Lister?

587
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,625
- A Level Four Naughty Lister?
- Oh, is that funny to you?

588
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,625
Hey, hey, hey. What are we doing here?

589
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,416
- Come on.
- I know this is killing you,

590
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,750
but you have to trust me.

591
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,291
Dismembering this shit bag
isn't gonna help.

592
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,916
It would feel good, but it won't help.

593
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,125
I'm right here.

594
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,208
Shut up.

595
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,583
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna put him to work.

596
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,166
- No, absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

597
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,791
You said you work for whoever pays you.

598
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,875
Today that's me.

599
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,833
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

600
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,125
He is telling us
everything he knows.

601
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,416
He just doesn't know who hired him.

602
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,958
Well, I mean,
how much are we talking here?

603
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,666
Garcia.

604
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,958
Okay.

605
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,458
Okay. I don't know who it was,
but I can figure out where they are.

606
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,833
Or where they were last night.

607
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,833
God.

608
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:34,208
Look, it is anonymous...
I don't know who it is...

609
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:38,916
but in my line of work, I need insurance,
you know, in case of billing issues,

610
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,083
so I Trojan-horse a digital tracking bug

611
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,833
- into their VPN.
- Are you saying...

612
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:43,958
Yeah, I can track the device.

613
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,375
Then I suggest you do it.

614
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,125
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

615
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,125
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

616
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,250
- Triple.
- Garcia.

617
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,916
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!

618
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,250
All right, all right. Double's fine.
It's Christmas.

619
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,416
Wise choice.

620
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,083
I need my cell phone.

621
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,416
Whoever did this...

622
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,250
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

623
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,500
I work alone.

624
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,458
- You used to.
- No offense,

625
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,291
but I'm not rolling into Aruba undercover
with a giant elf.

626
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,291
It's E.L.F.!

627
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,333
- Cal.
- We can't trust this guy.

628
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,333
That's why you're holding the leash.

629
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,583
And this...

630
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,583
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

631
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,375
You're mine until we find him.

632
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,166
I suggest you get going.

633
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,416
Claws!

634
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,125
Well, this is unfortunate.

635
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,583
No, this is what needed to be done.

636
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,958
I sincerely doubt that.

637
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:14,541
You know, I know a guy
who's gonna be very upset about this.

638
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,083
What are you gonna do with that?

639
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:26,041
The world is a mess
because they fear nothing.

640
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,750
I'm going to give them something to fear.

641
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,916

Okay, so worst-case scenario...
is there someone that can step in for him,

He knows when you're sleeping,
he knows when you're awake,

every single person on this planet.

He has a list the size of Rhode Island,
and he checks it twice.

If you were to try to read that list
just once,

it would take you a decade,

And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

716
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,791
is because he is Santa Claus,
the one and only,

801
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,125
Coordinates, the arctic.

802
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,250
I know this 'cause I'm the one
who sold 'em to you.

803
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,041
You...

804
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,958
You're The Wolf?

805
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,500
No. You should not be here.

806
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,916
Do you know what you've done
by coming here?

807
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,791
My client is not to be messed with.

808
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,791
Who's the client? New York?

809
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,625
Much worse.

810
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,791
She'll kill us. She'll kill us all.

811
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:39,500
- Who is it?
- I can't say her name.

812
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,500
She will hear.

813
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:49,541
Write her name in the sand.

814
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,791
- "Gree-la"?
- You idiot.

815
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,416
- "Gry-la"?
- No!

816
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
<i>"Gree-la"?</i>

817
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,416
Cal, Cal.

818
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,833
Callum Drift,

819
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:53,583
storied warrior of the North Pole.

820
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,916
Gryla, the Christmas Witch.

821
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,833
It has been many years.

822
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:02,958
Not enough.

823
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,333
Where is he?

824
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:08,041
He's right here, fast asleep.

825
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,500
Signal from Commander Drift.

826
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,166
<i>Gryla, where are you?</i>

827
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,083
The Witch.

828
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,458
I need him back unharmed immediately.

829
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:23,416
It is not to be, warrior!

830
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,041
I need M-WAT teams in motion

831
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:27,708
- to every one of her ancestral haunts.
- Yes, Director.

832
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,250
What is it you want?

833
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:34,166
The same thing I have always wanted
for hundreds of years.

834
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,041
To make them behave.

835
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,208
The time has come...

836
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:42,458
...to punish the naughty.

837
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,125
All of them.

838
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,916
Everyone who is on the list.

839
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,541
Everyone who has ever been

840
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,000
<i>on the list.</i>

841
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:54,291
From killers to jaywalkers.

842
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:57,416
Anyone who's ever lied or littered.

843
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,666
Anyone who's ever been rude or late.

844
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,083
You're talking about almost everyone.

845
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,708
Everyone I see fit.

846
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,583
Tomorrow they will all be punished.

847
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:14,708
And he is going to help.

848
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,791
You know he doesn't punish people.

849
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:19,833
Step away, warrior.

850
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,416
Let him go, Witch.

851
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,791
I've warned you.

You can't see it yet,

854
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,166
but when you wake up
this Christmas morning,

855
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,291
the world will be much, much...

856
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,125
...nicer.

857

- We got to get out of here.

not mess around. - Cal. Cal.

No.

867
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:13,333
Get him out of here. He's our only lead.
Don't let him get iced.

868
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,708
All right.

869
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,416

- That her?
- Sort of.

904
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,166
She's a shape-shifter.

905
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,583
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre

Huh.

Tracking shape-shifters
is a nightmare.

She said that she was gonna
punish them all, every level.

909
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,291
I'd be more worried

She wasn't negotiating.

Not helpful.

917
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,166
So, what would you normally do?

918
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:32,583
I mean, normally,
I'd be running credit cards,

919
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,333
checking pings off cell phone towers,

920
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,958
trying to build a footprint...
her, her associates.

921
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:39,333
Never tracked a witch before.

922
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,750
Dated a few.

923
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:41,958
Right, Cal?

924
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,291
I've dated several witches.
What's your point?

925
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,125
Would she have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about

926
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:50,000
because I'm, like, a regular human being?

927
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,250
Have you run a check on recent UDMs?

928
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,625
- What's that?
- Unauthorized deployments of magic.

929
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,833
Lot of hits. Pretty typical stuff.

930
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:03,833
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

931

01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:07,708
No, she's a conjurer.

933
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:12,166
Got a pair of conjurations
eight days ago, few hours apart.

934
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,166
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

935
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,250
The brother.

936
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,083
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

937
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,333
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted, yes.

938
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,541
She's working with the brother.

939
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,875
We don't know that.

940
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,666
No, but can you think
of a better place to hold Nick?

941
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,000
Think about it.
It's under a concealment dome,

942
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,916
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

943
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,375
He doesn't leave, and we don't visit.
That's the deal.

944
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,458
We bust in and Nick's not there...

945
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:36,708
MORA's not going. We're going.

946
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:38,083
And he's never gonna know we're there.

947
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,375
- Cal...
- T minus 17 hours, Director.

948
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,875
Keep me in the loop every step.

949
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,458
In two hours, I brief the presidents
and prime ministers

950
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:53,375
and kings and queens of everywhere
so they can prepare.

951
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,166
Prepare for what?

952
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,125
For the possibility of no Christmas.

953
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,333
Hey. You don't have a Wonder Woman
action figure, do you?

954
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,208
That's not how it works. Come on.

959
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,625
Dylan asked you to go
to his concert tonight and you said no?

960
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,000
What? No, that's not what happened.

961
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,666
He actually said I shouldn't go.
He said it was gonna be lame.

962
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,416
If he didn't want you to go,

963
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,666
<i>he wouldn't have brought it up.</i>

964
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,875
<i>An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.</i>

965
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:58,291
They just go,
whether the kid likes it or not.

966
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:01,250
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

967
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:03,541
Well, we both know
that's not my strong suit, Olivia.

968
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:06,208
Look, if he wanted me to go,
he should've just asked me.

969
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,708
He's vulnerable, Jack.

970
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:10,541
He's a kid, and he knows
you never show up.

971
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:13,166
Olivia, I'm in... I'm at work.

972
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,708
What am I supposed to do?

973
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,458
I don't want to have to tell you
what to do, Jack.

974
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:19,125
I want you to figure it out on your own,
because it's pretty easy.

975
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,708
The concert starts at 7:00.

976
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,583
Well, I'm not gonna be home by 7:00.
Just tell Dylan that I...

977
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:23,833
<i>I'm not telling him anything.</i>

978
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,083
If you want to tell him something,
do it yourself.

979
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,250
What?

980
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,541
I didn't say anything.

981
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,791
Dylan, right?

982
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,875
Yeah.

983
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,500
He's a good kid.

984
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,875
Yeah, I know he's a good kid.

985
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:17,208
It's not what you think.
His mother and I were never together.

986
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,541
I mean, I'm his father,
but I've never been his dad.

987
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,375
She's a doctor now,
and she's married to a really good guy,

988
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:28,416
and he is a good dad,
so the last thing the kid needs is, like,

989
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,291
you know, some spare dad
who's a degenerate gambler

990
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:34,416
hanging out with the scum of the earth,
who's got nothing to offer him, so...

991
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,833
Honestly, the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

992
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:42,125
so I don't get in the way
and he's not disappointed all the time.

993
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,583
Uh-huh.

994
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,291
"Uh-huh," what?

995
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:50,166
I'm just saying,
if you're trying not to disappoint him...

996
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
...doesn't sound like it's working.

997
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:23,625
<i>Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this, but...</i>

998
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:26,375
what's the deal with Santa
and his brother?

999
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,333
They used to work together...

1000
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,875
back in the beginning.

1001
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,916
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children,

1002
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,500
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

1003
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:44,583
Then the brother started making lists.

1004
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:47,291
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1005
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:50,833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

1006
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,291
But the brother became obsessed.

1007
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,708
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

1008
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,833
Yes.

1009
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:04,375
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

1010
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,750
Red was furious.

1011
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:12,625
So he took the list away,
and the brother never forgave him.

1012
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,625
He went out on his own,
eventually hooking up with the Witch,

1013
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:18,541
who was also in the punishment game,

1014
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:22,041
working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

1015
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:26,791
They were together for years,
but it ended badly.

1016
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:31,958
Santa's brother have a name,
or is it just "Santa's brother"?

1017
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
His name is Krampus.

1018
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,083
All right, listen to me. I don't know
what's waiting for us in here,

1019
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:45,500
but the brother, the Witch,

1020
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:48,208
they're extremely dangerous,
and not in the ways that you're used to.

1021
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:50,041
If you see them, do not engage.

1022
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,791
So don't pick a fight with the Witch.

1023
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:52,875
Got it.

1024
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,416
If Nick is here, he's probably
being held in the dungeon.

1025
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,250
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

1026
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,041
We're gonna have to quietly sneak
through the courtyard,

1027
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,958
past the guillotines,
break in and head down.

1028
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,041
The guillotines?

1029
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:05,083
Also, do not touch anything
under any circumstances.

1030
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,750
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

1031
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:09,708
You're human, therefore weak.

1032
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:12,541
So, if you need to touch anything,
get me to do it.

1033
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:17,000
Wait a minute. Are you not human?

1034
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,875
Do I look human?

1035
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,583
Hey. So listen, man.

1036
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:07,083
I think, if you don't need me here,
I might just go back to the car.

1037
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,458
Shh.

1038
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:16,583
- Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds?

1039
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,666
Stand back.

1040
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:33,833
Ellen, distract them.

1041
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,416
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1042
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,875
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1043
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,125
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1044
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:20,125
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha...

1045
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,250
What'd you do?

1046
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,625
What do you mean what did I do?

1047
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,000
I didn't do anything.

1048
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:27,833
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1049
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:29,458
Thieves!

1050
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,000
Holy shit.

1051
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:35,041
Whoa, whoa.

1052
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,291
Cal! Cal!

1053
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,291
My name is Callum Drift,
commander of the E.L.F.

1054
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,916
- We are not thieves.
- Yeah, we're not thieves!

1055
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,916
We're not thieves!

1056
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,083
Oh!

1057
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,166
This was in his pocket.

1058
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,500
All right, I can explain that.

1059
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,125
I can explain that.

1060
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,958
I told you not to touch anything.

1061
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:00,583
It was an innocent mistake.

1062
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:04,083
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1063
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,708
Not innocent and not a mistake.

1064
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:09,583
Well, who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

1065
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:12,041
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1066
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,208
Guests come, they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

1067
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,791
I shouldn't be surprised.

1068
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,500
Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

1069
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,750
You disappointed in me, too, Cal?

1070
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,875
I have no expectations of you, Jack,
so I can't be disappointed.

1071
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,708
You know, I got problems of my own.

1072
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:39,625
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

1073
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,750
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

1074
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,458
If you look at it a certain way,
what choice did I even have?

1075
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:48,583
You have every choice. It's all choices.

1076
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,708
You don't just happen
to be on the list, Jack.

1077
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:53,333
You put yourself there.

1078
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:55,375
You decide to steal gold.

1079
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:59,541
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

1080
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,791
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

1081
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,416
Counting on me to do my job.

1082
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:19,208
Nick always says that every decision,
big or small, is an opportunity.

1083
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,500
To be nice?

1084
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,708
To be good.

1085
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,125
Or not.

1086
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:32,083
I was one day away from retirement.

1087
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,833
Then this happens.

1088
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,666
After 542 years.

1089
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,291
I resigned yesterday.

1090
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,791
You did?

1091
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,000
Why?

1092
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,500
I couldn't see it anymore.

1093
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:52,833
Couldn't see what?

1094
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
Doesn't matter.

1095
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,125
The third touch.

1096
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,875
Is that him?

1097
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:32,875
What are they doing?

1098
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,166
They're playing Krampusschlap.

1099
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,750
Krampusschlap?

1100
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,916
It's the official game of Krampusnacht.

1101
01:16:57,458 --> 01:17:02,791
Ever undefeated, Dread Lord Krampus!

1102
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,500
Callum Drift.

1103
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,000
Lord Krampus.

1104
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:20,166
The festivities are just beginning,

1105
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,916
but I don't remember inviting you.

1106
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:31,166
You shouldn't be here.

1107
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,666
You know you shouldn't be here,

1108
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,375
and yet here you are.

1109
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,166
And with a mortal.

1110
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,291
Uh, I'm Jack O'Malley.

1111
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:42,833
I didn't... I'm not...

1112
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:45,333
We didn't even... I mean, obviously we...

1113
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:47,041
I just met him today.

1114
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,166
The big one was armed with this.

1115
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,125
A Northern Vambrace.

1116
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,583
Thank you.

1117
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:57,125
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1118
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,333
Krampus, I can explain...

1119
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,750
You're trying to find him,

1120
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,333
and you thought he would be here.

1121
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,583
Well, guess what, Northerner.

1122
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,708
He's not here.

1123
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:17,875
Last night, he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

1124
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

1125
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:25,666
Are you accusing me of something, Drift?

1126
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,708
You and she were partners once.

1127
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,666
Roaming the countryside, the villages.

1128
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,166
Punishing people.

1129
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,916
Yes.

1130
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,666
But back then, she was glorious.

1131
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:41,166
An ogre 18 feet high.

1132
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,333
The skin of an elephant.

1133
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:46,625
Giant pair of tails.

1134
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:52,041
And yes, punishing as the cruelest winter.

1135
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:55,958
We had some wonderful times together.

1136
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,708
But I gave up that work, remember?

1137
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:05,000
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty,

1138
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:08,041
trying to scare them into decency.

1139
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,000
I did my part!

1140
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,583
The only punishing I do now...

1141
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,333
...is for fun.

1142
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,250
Like my good friend over here...

1143
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:24,500
...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

1144
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,291
But today is not Krampusnacht.

1145
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,333
In this house, Northerner,

1146
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:33,625
it is always Krampusnacht!

1147
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,583
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

1148
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:38,208
Ah, ah, ah! Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

1149
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:40,083
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1150
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:43,500
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1151
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:45,833
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah! Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

1152
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:48,166
- Krampus!
- Ah, ah, ah! Ooh...

1153
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,500
Why was she here?

1154
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:56,875
Many years ago, she gave me a gift.

1155
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,166
She came because she wanted it back.

1156
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,541
A gift? What gift?

1157
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,791
The Glaskäfig.

1158
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,458
On its face, a simple glass snow globe,

1159
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:11,166
but its true purpose is nefarious.

1160
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,000
Tremendously punishing.

1161
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:16,041
She wants to punish them all.

1162
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,750
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

1163
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:22,125
A prison for but one.

1164
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,791
Krampus, I need to find him.

1165
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,750
Let me go.

1166
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,083
And why...

1167
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,166
would I do that?

1168
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,833
Because we need him.

1169
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,541
Now more than ever, we need him.

1170
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,041
And you know that.

1171
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,166
Let me go.

1172
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,125
Northerner.

1173
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,500
You are not going anywhere.

1174
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,541
You, get out.

1175
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,208
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1176
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:17,583
There is a price for this intrusion.

1177
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,875
Now and forever,

1178
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,208
Drift belongs to me.

1179
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,708
So I can...

1180
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,500
just walk out of here?

1181
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,833
I suggest you run.

1182
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,958
You'll learn to love it here.

1183
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,708
Take him away.

1184
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:47,416
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

1185
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,041
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

1186
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:51,958
Lord Krampus, um...

1187
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,541
you and I aren't so different.

1188
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:01,000
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

1189
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,416
Ah. Do you, now?

1190
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,708
Yeah.

1191
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,583
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1192
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:08,875
Bit of a gambler?

1193
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,375
Well, so am I.

1194
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:14,833
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1195
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,833
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

1196
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,833
What?

1197
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:23,000
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

1198
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,833
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

1199
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:28,541
so just hear me out.

1200
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,625
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

1201
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,708
If he wins, we walk.

1202
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,750
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1203
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,583
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

1204
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,250
No shame.

1205
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,625
Lot of people watching.

1206
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:50,583
Imbeciles.

1207
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,750
I love it.

1208
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,458
- Oh.
- Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

1209
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,500
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

1210
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:08,708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

1211
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:20,291
The rules are as follows:

1212
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,708
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1213
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:27,500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

1214
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,541
First touch.

1215
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,250
That's you.

1216
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,500
You know, I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1217
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,541
Come on.

1218
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:54,416
I'm sure you do.

1219
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,916
He's still your brother.

1220
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,625
And he never gave up on you.

1221
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:02,041
What would you know about it?

1222
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,958
I know him.

1223
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,625
Take your best "schlap."

1224
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,000
Interesting.

1225
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:29,500
My turn.

1226
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,583
I could be merciful

1227
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:41,291
and kill him on the first touch.

1228
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:44,500
But what fun would that be, huh?

1229
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,250
Oh, my God.

1230
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,750
Hey, buddy. You okay?

1231
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,750
He just slapped the shit out of me.

1232
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,125
Yeah, that was so embarrassing.

1233
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:20,166
I love this game!

1234
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,291
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I...

1235
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:23,875
Just get up. Trust me.

1236
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,875
I can't...

1237
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,250
Second touch.

1238
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,125
Oh. Sorry.

1239
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,541
Let me make it easier for you.

1240
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,833
Come on.

1241
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,708
Come on.

1242
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,875
Come on.

1243
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,500
Cover us.

1244
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:07,458
Ellen, come on!

1245
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,500
I thought I had some shady friends.

1246
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,458
I can't believe that worked.

1247
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,833
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

1248
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,416
No, it was great.

1249
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,125
Oh.

1250
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:40,833
I misjudged you.

1251
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,750
Not what you'd expect
from a Class Four Naughty Lister, right?

1252
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,041
Well, it's Level Four.

1253
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,750
- Ah.
- But that's what I'm saying.

1254
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:51,208
You could've left, but you didn't.

1255
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,166
Thank you.

1256
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,791
All right.

1257
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,666
Should we go find your guy?

1258
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,833
Let's save Christmas.

1259
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:06,208
Right.

1260
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:07,250
Say it.

1261
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,208
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Say it.

1262
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,625
- I don't want to.
- Let's save Christmas.

1263
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:11,875
I'm not gonna say that.

1264
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:15,708
I'm gonna need you to say,
"Let's save Christmas."

1265
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,125
All right. God. Okay.

1266
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:19,916
Let's save Christmas.

1267
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,875
That was terrible.

1268
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:23,125
Okay.

1269
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:25,458
All right, all right.

1270
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:29,458
Let's save Christmas.

1271
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,333
- There it is.
- All right.

1272
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:34,041
All right, so the, uh, snow globe,
what's the deal with that?

1273
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,291
The "glossy pig"?

1274
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,958
Glaskäfig. It's German for "glass cage."

1275
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,250
Well, what do you think
Gryla's trying to do?

1276
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,208
- Is there...
- Shh.

1277
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:43,208
<i>...Gryla's trying...?</i>

1278
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:47,041
We got to go.

1279
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,666
Mum.

1280
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,708
Ready for another test.

1281
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:55,000
Good.

1282
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:57,458
The next name on the list?

1283
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,916
No.

1284
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,333
I have a better idea.

1285
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,541
She said she wanted to punish them all.

1286
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,583
It seems like the Glaskäfig
was just for one person.

1287
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:13,083
Is it possible she can make more of 'em
with, like, witch magic or...

1288
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,916
She would need billions of them.

1289
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,458
She's immensely powerful,
but that's a big lift for a conjurer.

1290
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:19,625
Okay.

1291
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:22,500
I mean, honestly, the only place that has
that kind of manufacturing capacity...

1292
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,875
Look out!

1293
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:44,708
♪ ♪

1294
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,750
This something that happens to you a lot?

1295
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:55,375
Unexplained player piano
in the middle of a German highway.

1296
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:57,833
No. This is rare.

1297
01:30:04,541 --> 01:30:05,958
It's for you.

1298
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:08,500
Well, I'm not touching that thing.

1299
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:11,083
Just get back in the truck. We'll drive
right around the haunted piano.

1300
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:13,666
We have to open it.

1301
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,375
This... this is how it starts.

1302
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,416
You're doing it.

1303
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:31,166
Oh, see?

1304
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,000
Dylan.

1305
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:40,250
<i>Did you send me this stupid present
instead of coming to this thing?</i>

1306
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,958
Wait, what?

1307
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:44,000
Because if you don't want to come,
I don't care.

1308
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:46,083
I wanted to be there. I really did.

1309
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:48,208
- Then something...
- <i>Just stop, okay?</i>

1310
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:51,458
<i>You don't have to pretend
because my mom is guilt-tripping you.</i>

1311
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,875
I'm not pretending.

1312
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:55,166
- <i>I really want to find a way...</i>
- You never come to anything.

1313
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,958
Yeah, I... I know.

1314
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:58,291
- I know.
- <i>Whatever.</i>

1315
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,666
<i>I got to go. Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts, okay?</i>

1316
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:04,166
W-Wait, wait.
Dylan, what'd you mean by that?

1317
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,333
<i>This thing.</i>

1318
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:09,291
- Dylan, don't touch that. Wait.
- No, don't.

1319
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:11,166
Do you seriously think
that there's anything...

1320
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,833
Dylan, listen to me. Put that down.

1321
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,750
<i>Because I'm here to tell you that...</i>

1322
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,166
What is this?

1323
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,458
What's going on?

1324
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,958
What's happening?

1325
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,125
Put that down!

1326
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,583
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

1327
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:29,875
I don't know.

1328
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,166
Jack.

1329
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:39,708
It's my kid.

1330
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,708
Find me.

1331
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,000
Dad?

1332
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:59,083
- Dad! What's going on?
- Dylan.

1333
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:00,375
Where are we?

1334
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:04,625
Oh, my God.

1335
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,750
Oh, my God.

1336
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,041
It worked.

1337
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:19,208
Mm. Jack O'Malley.

1338
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,291
Level Four.

1339
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:24,583
What a perfect way to start my collection.

1340
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:27,416
Bring production online.

1341
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:52,416
Tonight, I will deliver one of these
to every single deviant on the list.

1342
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,500
And when they wake up and open their gift,

1343
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:57,583
they'll join my collection,

1344
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:01,583
and the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1345
01:33:01,666 --> 01:33:02,833
Finally.

1346
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:07,083
Tonight, I make the ride.

1347
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:11,458
Director, we have Drift.

1348
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:12,791
What happened?

1349
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:14,416
What do you know about the Glaskäfig?

1350
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,791
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison the naughty.

1351
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:18,291
Krampus has it. Why?

1352
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:20,291
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

1353
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,875
<i>And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on the list.</i>

1354
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:22,958
Wait. Slow down.

1355
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:24,375
O'Malley just got globed

1356
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,250
- <i>and disappeared.</i>
- What?

1357
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,458
His kid, too.

1358
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:29,250
Oh, dear Lord.

1359
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:31,416
- <i>Run O'Malley's tag.</i>
- <i>Yes, Director.</i>

1360
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:36,208
Zoe, I think she's trying
to mass-produce the Glaskäfig.

1361
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:38,000
- <i>How could she possibly do that?</i>
- Think about it.

1362
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:40,708
<i>What's the one place that's capable
of something like that?</i>

1363
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:42,083
The North Pole?

1364
01:33:42,166 --> 01:33:44,208
But Nick's not there.
The complex runs on his power.

1365
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,250
That can't be it.

1366
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:48,583
- Unless...
- <i>Unless he never left.</i>

1367
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:52,625
- But the snowcat, the jet.
- <i>Drones, diversions.</i>

1368
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:55,875
Nick is still there.

1369
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:59,583
Director, I am not picking up
a signal for O'Malley's tracker.

1370
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:03,625
Because he's under the dome.

1371
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:05,875
<i>But I've been talking
to your team all night.</i>

1372
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,791
You have?

1373
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,916
<i>Try Partridge.</i>

1374
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,166
- Connect to Partridge.
- Yes, Director.

1375
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:20,000
- <i>Hi. Cal.</i>
- <i>Hey. How you holding up, MC?</i>

1376
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:21,458
Well, I can't sleep.

1377
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:25,041
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

1378
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,458
For when he comes home.

1379
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,000
Well, he's gonna love that.

1380
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,291
What do you got baking?

1381
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:33,291
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

1382
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:37,333
He'll love that.

1383
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:40,583
Hang in. I'll keep you posted.

1384
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:42,500
<i>Thanks.</i>

1385
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:45,375
That's not her.

1386
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:46,666
What do you mean?

1387
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,208
<i>Nick hates macaroons.</i>

1388
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,458
They're shape-shifters.

1389
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,958
<i>The Witch, the Lads.</i>

1390
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,666
They're all shape-shifters.

1391
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,500
The North Pole has been taken.

1392
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:07,083
They're onto us.

1393
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:08,708
Where are we?

1394
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:11,666
- What's happening?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, listen.

1395
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,208
Now, I know
what this is gonna sound like.

1396
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,708
Basically...

1397
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:25,375
...Santa is missing,
and that giant lady is a witch,

1398
01:35:25,458 --> 01:35:30,250
and she got the snow globes
from a giant demonic Christmas...

1399
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:31,750
goat man.

1400
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:33,708
And now they're gonna make
millions of them

1401
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:37,166
with that magical photocopier thing.

1402
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,291
Look, I don't have
all the technical details,

1403
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:44,666
but basically, these globes are meant
to imprison the naughty people forever.

1404
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,875
Forever?

1405
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,958
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

1406
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,875
Remember, can't trust anyone.

1407
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:02,083
I've got a signal.

1408
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:04,041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1409
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,875
- We're close.
- Hey, chief.

1410
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:12,958
Fred?

1411
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:17,166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

1412
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,500
Shape-shifters.

1413
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,166
Good tidings.

1414
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,041
It says he should be right here.

1415
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:39,416
The old tunnel system.

1416
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,041
Runs right beneath the original workshop.

1417
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:44,125
Let's go.

1418
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,583
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1419
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,708
What?

1420
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:50,041
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1421
01:36:50,125 --> 01:36:52,208
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

1422
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,625
You said it was for naughty people,
didn't you?

1423
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:55,083
Well, she said that, but...

1424
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,791
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1425
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:58,291
Look at me.

1426
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,583
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1427
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:05,708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1428
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,000
You're only in here be...

1429
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,916
because of me.

1430
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,708
What did you do?

1431
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:17,208
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1432
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:19,625
It's... long list.

1433
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,958
But bigger than any of that,
it's what I didn't do.

1434
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,875
What are you talking about?

1435
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,208
I've been a terrible father.

1436
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,875
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is.

1437
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,583
I haven't been around.

1438
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:43,625
I told myself I was doing you a favor,
which is bullshit.

1439
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:47,166
It was bad for you,
and it was terrible for me.

1440
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,333
I've made some mistakes, pal. I know that.

1441
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,750
But I also know that I can do better.

1442
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,958
And I know that's easier said than done.

1443
01:37:57,041 --> 01:38:00,625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

1444
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

1445
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1446
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,958
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1447
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:20,625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1448
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:24,541
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

1449
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:27,291
but I know I can do better,

1450
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:30,833
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1451
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:33,125
I will never stop trying.

1452
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:01,208
What just happened?

1453
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1454
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,541
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1455
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,333
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

1456
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:23,333
Ow.

1457
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,291
Cal.

1458
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:30,000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

1459
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,750
Wonder Woman.

1460
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,000
It's him.

1461
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,250
You all right?

1462
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,375
Yeah. Yeah.

1463
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:38,916
It's good to see you.

1464
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,916
Dad?

1465
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,291
Buddy, come here.

1466
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,791
I want you to meet some friends.

1467
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:47,958
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

1468
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,833
The one and only Dylan.

1469
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:51,250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1470
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,916
Welcome to the North Pole.

1471
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,250
Huh?

1472
01:39:57,333 --> 01:40:00,000
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1473
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,833
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1474
01:40:01,916 --> 01:40:04,250
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

1475
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:06,250
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1476
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,416
Cal, we saw her.

1477
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1478
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:11,375
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1479
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:12,541
to everybody on the list.

1480
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:15,291
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1481
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:16,541
Without him.

1482
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:18,125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1483
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

1484
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:24,500
Wait.

1485
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,500
Chief.

1486
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:34,833
Garcia.

1487
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:36,125
Cal.

1488
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,750
Ma'am.

1489
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,500
Where is he?

1490
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,333
Gryla, stop!

1491
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,291
I was just leaving.

1492
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:29,791
- Go. Take him.
- Come with me, Dylan. Got him.

1493
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:48,541
Come on!

1494
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,625
Go!

1495
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,333
Hyah!

1496
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:20,666
Nick.

1497
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,750
Come on, Red. I got you.

1498
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,541
Red?

1499
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:37,208
Come back to me. Come back to me, boss.

1500
01:44:37,291 --> 01:44:38,833
Wake up.

1501
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:43,791
Nick? Nick!

1502
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:45,708
It's Cal.

1503
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:58,916
Cal!

1504
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,500
Holy shit.

1505
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:15,625
Jack.

1506
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,625
Run.

1507
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,708
No way, man.

1508
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:26,083
For a guy like me,
there's worse ways to go out

1509
01:45:26,166 --> 01:45:28,000
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1510
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,458
Gryla!

1511
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,750
It's time for you to go.

1512
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:38,833
Oh, I'll go,

1513
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:42,125
but I'm taking him with me.

1514
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:44,958
You're not taking him anywhere.

1515
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:48,625
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

1516
01:45:48,708 --> 01:45:51,833
The punishing begins tonight.

1517
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,500
You're gonna have to go through me first.

1518
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:57,333
With pleasure.

1519
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:59,666
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1520
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,750
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1521
01:46:01,833 --> 01:46:03,416
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

1522
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,458
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1523
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:08,791
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

1524
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:23,000
You imbeciles have no idea
how to talk to a woman like this.

1525
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:25,041
A real woman.

1526
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:28,750
She's my ex.

1527
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,833
Hello.

1528
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:34,000
My love.

1529
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:35,666
Get out of here, Krampus.

1530
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,833
I can't do that.

1531
01:46:38,916 --> 01:46:43,666
And lovely as it is
to see your miserable face,

1532
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:48,416
my brother has somewhere to be.

1533
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:59,416
Just like old times.

1534
01:47:31,166 --> 01:47:33,791
Haven't you had enough?

1535
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:38,000
If you want to take him,

1536
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,333
you're gonna have to kill me.

1537
01:47:41,416 --> 01:47:43,416
Gladly.

1538
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,541
Your sacrifice will mean nothing.

1539
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,375
Gryla!

1540
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:52,208
Enough!

1541
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:57,041
Any last words
for your most faithful warrior?

1542
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:59,208
Only one.

1543
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:03,125
<i>Kavalame!</i>

1544
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:11,333

1545

1546

No.

1547
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:43,416
- No!
- Well, look at you.

1548
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,500
Oh, shut up!

1549

Nick.

1550
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:52,416
You okay?

1551
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:55,708
Yeah.

1552
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,250
What took you so long?

1553
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:22,791
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1554

Let's not get mushy.

1555
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:28,291
Thank you, brother.

1556
01:49:31,416 --> 01:49:34,375
Merry Christmas...

1557

brother.

1558
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:39,708
You want to maybe stick around a while?

1559
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:44,708
Don't push it.

1560
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,500
Get to work.

1561
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,125
And you...

1562
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:53,958
I want a rematch.

1563
01:50:00,666 --> 01:50:03,000
Happy Krampusnacht!

01:50:09,666 --> 01:50:11,333

I lost it there for a while, Nick.

1603
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:48,833
It's easy to lose it, Cal.

1604
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,000
Important thing is to keep trying.

1605
01:54:57,916 --> 01:54:59,375
Nick.

1606
01:54:59,458 --> 01:55:01,291
I'd like to stay on.

1607
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,791
If you'll have me.

1608
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:09,541
You got it, Commander.

1609
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,666
Did we just save Christmas?

1610
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:21,583
I think we just saved Christmas.
