they'll come back

They're not coming back. Let's go.

Look, as a former Eagle Scout

101
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,551
no big deal,

102
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,137
the first rule of getting lost
is to stay in the same place.

That way you can be found.

the League of Assassins,

00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,727
the first rule when you've been
attacked is to keep moving.

I sort of think League wisdom

can't find us, or whatever.

It's because they're dead.

164
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,735
And the sooner that you accept that,

165
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,571
the sooner you can move on.

166

The sooner we can all move on.

167

170
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,671
I can't stay here. I need to
find somewhere I belong.

00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,798
Sara, wait. You can't go.

172

Savage is still out there.

173

Don't draw undue attention on yourselves.

You sound dubious.

If Chronos was going to settle
for taking one person,

you'd think it would be you.

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,053
Back on the <i>Waverider,</i>
you could've taken your boy Rip.

325
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,221
But you took me instead. Why?

326
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,766
Hey, if you're gonna kill me,

327
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,226
you could at least tell me
what's going on.

328
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,564
<i>You should have figured it out by now.</i>

329
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,741
After all,

330
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,954
I am supposed to be the dumb one.

331
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,422
How?

332
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,803
I think I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here!

333
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,096
You deserve nothing.

334
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,723
Says the man who sold us out
to the pirates.

335
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,076
When I dropped you off in that forest,

336
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,142
I meant to kill you.

337
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,727
That was the plan.

338
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,355
You should have stuck with
the plan and done me a favor.

339
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,441
SNART: <i>I wish there were
some other way, Mick.</i>

340
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,609
(GUN POWERING UP)

341
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,444
You haven't got the guts.

342
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,238
<i>You wanna kill me? Kill me.</i>

343
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,824
Only one of us
is walking out of here alive.

344
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,033
You're right.

345
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,995
I knew you lacked the guts.

346
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,163
(GRUNTS)

347
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,041
I am sorry, Mick.

348
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,919
I may not have trusted you
on the ship with the team,

349
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,923
but I always,
always was coming back for you.

350
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,342
Seems like one of us lost track of time.

351
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,554
- How long did you--
- By the time they found me,

352
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,764
I'd nearly lost my mind.

353
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,060
I was so weak, I was
strangling rats to survive.

354
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,979
When who found you?

355
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,482
The Time Masters.

356
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,947
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

357
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,116
Time doesn't exist there
the way it does on Earth.

358
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,494
<i>I've spent lifetimes
being restored by them,</i>

359
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,873
training by them, fighting by them,

360
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,250
being reborn.

361
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:08,672
And, uh, when exactly did your new
friends give you the, uh, lobotomy?

362
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,986
You think I was hunting you and friends

363
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,346
because the Time Masters made me?

364
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,891
They barely had to ask.

365
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,229
Hey. Uh, can we talk for a sec?

366
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,000
Just, with everything that's going on,

367
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,624
I don't know that this is the best time.

368
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,445
You say that like
there's gonna be a better time.

369
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,948
Okay.

370
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,661
Look, we have spent every night
the last two years together,

371
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,872
playing board games, eating,

372
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,225
and deciding who was gonna cook
and who was gonna wash dishes,

373
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,809
falling asleep to <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

374
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,711
But the second you saw the <i>Waverider,</i>

375
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,558
it was like those two years
never happened.

376
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,590
Look, we were both trying to adapt

377
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,760
to an impossible situation.

378
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,470
But you're not a college professor

379
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,515
and I'm definitely not a librarian.

380
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:04,144
So honestly, I'm just excited
to be able to be myself again.

381
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,039
I mean, aren't you even a little bit happy

382
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,356
to be back on the ship?

383
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,483
I was happy with the life
we built together.

384
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,194
What I thought would be our future.

385
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,447
This all just feels like moving backwards.

386
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,242
- (SIGHS)
- Moving backwards.

387
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,789
What if Sara didn't
move forwards with her life,

388
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,082
she moved backwards?

389
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,668
She said she wanted to go to
a place where she belonged.

390
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,381
What's the one place in 1958
she already called home?

391
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,799
The League of Assassins.

392
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,426
There is one source that we
could check to test your theory.

393
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,554
Gideon, bring up the Shadow Record.

394
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,763
Shadow Record?

395
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,866
GIDEON: <i>The list of every member of
the League of Assassins</i>

396
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,518
<i>since the invention of writing
in 3200 B.C.</i>

397
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,813
Fascinating. Except these sheets
of papyrus are entirely blank.

398
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,648
No, no, no.
The League uses invisible ink.

399
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,568
I did my graduate thesis at
the Academy on their history.

400
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:54,945
Gideon.

401
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,280
Sara said that Ra's al Ghul

402
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,246
had lived nearly a century
before she met him.

403
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,449
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit.

404
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,327
It's basically a life-extending jacuzzi.

405
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,497
Located in a place that's
the opposite of life-extending.

406
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,833
Uh, you should count
yourself lucky, Dr. Palmer.

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,080
Only a handful of outsiders

408
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,878
have been inside the League's fortress

409
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,713
and lived to tell the tale.

410
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,107
GIDEON: <i>You are correct, Captain.</i>

411
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,883
<i>There is a mention of Ta-er al-Sahfer.</i>

412
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,769
That's, uh, Sara's
League of Assassins name.

413
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,429
According to the Shadow Record,
she joined the League in 1958.

414
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,974
Incredible. Sara became a member
of the secret organization

415
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,684
that trained her to be an assassin

416
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,020
50 years prior to
when she initially joined.

417
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,605
Sara needs our help.

418
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,441
By all accounts, Ra's al Ghul is
a very controlling,

419
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,860
very homicidal fanatic.

420
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,280
Gideon, chart a course for Nanda Parbat.

421
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,288
Look, if you're gonna kill me,
just do it already.

422
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,956
I'm not gonna kill you.

423
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,044
I'm gonna take a trip back to Central City

<i>The beautiful thing about time travel</i>

426
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,093
is I get to kill her more than once.

427
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,097
I can kill Lisa in front of you.

428
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,351
Go back in time, and kill her
in front of you again.

429
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,144

I used to think the
most beautiful thing on Earth

435
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,323
was fire.

436

Now I know it's vengeance.

437

Uh, perhaps Jefferson and I should--

438
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,508
Extricating Sara from the likes
of the League requires stealth.

439

So no Firestorm for the two of you.

440

And you're out of practice.

441
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,599

483
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,541
<i>for stranding you in 1958--</i>

484
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,960
It's the will of Ra's al Ghul.

485
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,296
Trespassers are to be executed.

486
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,032
We just need a little more time
to get through to her.

487
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,057
Do Time Masters have

488
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,952
a different understanding
of the word "executed"?

489
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,456
No, no, no. It's called "time drift."

490
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,438
When one spends too long
in an alien timeline,

491
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:44,067
one loses ties with one's
former self, uh, former identity.

492
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,069
- Oh, my God.
- What?

493
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,738
I didn't understand it before, but...

494
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,741
My powers, they went dormant.

495
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,577
- What are you talking about?
- My wings.

496
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,746
You must have noticed that I
haven't been able to "hawk out"

497
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,123
in almost two years.

498
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,960
I just thought that you didn't want to.

499
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,211
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,255
Because it was so hard for you

501
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,382
to give up hope
that the team would return.

502
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,589
When you finally did,
you started to be happy again.

503
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,220
And I couldn't bear
telling you that I wasn't.

504
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:15,223
- (HISSES) That ain't good.
- I had no idea.

505
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,602
Look, Ray, I loved being with you.

506
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,104
I wasn't just losing my powers,

507
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,065
I was losing my memories of my past lives.

508
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,151
I was starting to lose myself.

509
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,445

510
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:34,451
(SIGHS) You didn't have to protect me.
I could have handled the truth.

511
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,578
It couldn't have been so easy
for Raymond, either,

512
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,580
having to give up being the Atom.

513
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,625
I'm sorry. Can we have a private moment.

514
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,335
I think we all wish

515
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,253
you would have had this moment in private.

516
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,005
(CHAINS CLANK)

517
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,259
Don't you think that we were
meant for something greater

518
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,136
than being stuck in 1960,

519
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,638
eating fondue with the neighbors?

520
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,848
Yeah, we were meant to be
tortured and executed in

521
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,934
Nanda "I can't believe
I am back here" Parbat.

522
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:03,813
If we die, at least it would be
in pursuit of a greater purpose.

523
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,983
- That's it.
- What's it?

524
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,443
Ra's al Ghul's purpose in life

525
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,962
is to see that the League continues

526
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,666
with all of its ancient traditions intact.

527
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,615
Including murdering intruders.

528
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,159
I will appeal to Ra's al Ghul's respect

529
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,495
for the League's traditions

530
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:23,458
invoking one of them right now.

531
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,834
What kind of traditions, man?

532
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,169

533
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,506
Guards!

534
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,721
Would you mind
loosening these up a little bit

535
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:37,931
before you leave?

536
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,269
Just out of curiosity,

537
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,664
what do you think your new masters
are going to do with you

538
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,232
once you've delivered the team up to them?

539
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,442
I don't expect there's a pension plan

540
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,695
for old bounty hunters.

541
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,174
Once they get what they want from you,

542
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,866
they're gonna toss you aside.

543
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,076
Like you tossed me aside?

544
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,704
You and I both made choices
that led us to this moment.

545
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,540
What matters, Mick, is your next move.

546
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,210
And I'm willing to bet that
some little piece of the old you

547
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,879
is in that armor somewhere.

548
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,924
No, you're wrong.

549
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,262
Mr. Hunter.

550
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,723
Captain, as a point of fact.

551
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,599
Right.

552
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,685
Well, I do hope your request
for an audience

553
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,104
is not an attempt to justify
your trespass here.

554
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,272
Certainly not.

555
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,108
But it would be remiss of me
if I didn't use this opportunity

556
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:34,738
to reiterate that Sara
is very important to me.

557
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,365
To all of us.

558
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,242
And as she is to me.

559
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,538
And as you can all see,
she has chosen to remain here.

560
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:48,251
Yes, well, if that is her wish,
we will indeed honor it.

561
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,711
Well, thank you.

562
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,465
But your deaths will make
that concession irrelevant.

563
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,443
Well, according to my
understanding of League Law,

564
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,553
the whole, uh, death thing can be avoided

565
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,305
should we prevail at trial.

566
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,559
Yeah, uh, I don't think these guys
are the <i>People's Court</i> type.

567
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,728
I demand a trial by combat.

568
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,398
And how's a man such as you

569
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,109
so well-versed on our traditions?

570
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,820
Do we have an accord?

571
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,453
May victory be yours.

572
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,000
I was under the impression
that I would be fighting you.

573
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,294
Then it would seem
your understanding of our laws

574
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,462
requires some refinement.

575

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,253
her skills were unmatched.

646
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,423
It was as if she had
completed the training before.

647
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,886
I suppose that's because
you're both from the future.

648
00:34:55,553 --> 00:35:00,349
When I came to your doorstep
for the second time in my life,

649
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:04,562
I thought that I could find a home here.

650
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,647
That this is where I really belong.

651

But your soul is divided

652
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,695
by your ability to kill
and your desire to show mercy.

653
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:18,701
And there is no place for one
so conflicted within the League.

654
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,708
Ta-er al-Sahfer, I release you.

655
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:32,465
You can reclaim your previous
name and your past life.

656
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,425
Thank you.

In October 2008,

661
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,692
Why would I send Talia on such a journey?

662
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,194
Not Talia.

it's quite remarkable Mr. Rory</i>

674
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,438
considering you killed him.

675
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,942
If you think back,
I never actually said I killed him.

676
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,777
No, you just let us think that you did.

677
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,779
I didn't have to try too hard, did I?

678
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:38,614
<i>Well, maybe I should have.</i>

679
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,050
Then at least he wouldn't have wound up

680

a chew toy for the Time Masters.

681

But if you did, we wouldn't
have this opportunity.

682
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,331
Opportunity? To do what?

683
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,920
To reform Mr. Rory.

684
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,048
He killed Aldus.

685

Under the influence of the Time Masters.

686
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,928
"Chronos" killed Aldus.

687
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,598
Mr. Rory was fighting
on our side that day.

688
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:07,143
I know what it's like
to be trained by an organization

<i>for one purpose, to kill.</i>

that it can inspire.</i>

691

He's more than just
a criminal and an arsonist.
