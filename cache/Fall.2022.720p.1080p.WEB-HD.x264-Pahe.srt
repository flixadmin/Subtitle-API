1
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,505
There's a big gap.

2
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,946
This feels like
the only route,
let's keep going.

3
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,127
You okay?

4
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:29,263
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:31,874
Okay.

6
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,572
Be careful.

7
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,183
...two, three!

8
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:39,142
You okay?

9
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,796
Okay.

10
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,016
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,061
Never better.

12
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,891
Okay.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,594
Whoa, whoa,
- you're good.
- Shit.

14
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:57,856
You're good. Yeah?

15
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,467
You're good?

16
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,382
No.

17
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,036
Okay, you've done
way scarier than this.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,387
Remember A.J. Hackett,
Snake Dike.

19
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,258
Stupid singing competition.

20
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,781
God, you married
this sad sack,

21
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,740
for Christ's sake.

22
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,524
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

23
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,006
One... Two...

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,095
Three!

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,706
Come on! I got you.

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,968
That's my girl.

27
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,799
Ew! Gross!

28
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,497
You guys, get a room!

29
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,109
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,285
Careful, H,
there's loose rock
around the elbow.

31
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,853
Worry about
your ropes, bitches.

32
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,289
I'm fine.

33
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,378
Whoo!

34
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,032
Try to keep up!

35
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:56,437
Taking your time there,
hotshot.

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,396
Hunter, you show off!

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,571
Whoo!

38
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,044
Dan!

39
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,658
Dan!

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,530
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

41
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:47,923
Dan, are you okay?

42
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,969
Just hold on.
I'm coming down.

43
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,494
Come on. Come on.
I can't make it.

44
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,844
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

45
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,280
I just need
a little more length.

46
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:59,456
Can you un-clip?
Are you secure?

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,066
- Are you secure?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,764
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

49
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,722
Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

50
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,507
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

51
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,638
Ready?

52
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,427
Can you reach it?

53
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,950
Just...
Just one second.

54
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,386
All right.
I think I can make it.

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,083
Hold on, Dan.

56
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,389
I'm almost there.

57
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,521
Just need
a little more momentum.

58
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:21,739
Okay.

59
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,133
No!

60
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,223
Dan!

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,554
<i>Hey!</i>

62
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,816
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>this is Becky and Dan.</i>

63
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,773
<i>Leave a message.</i>

64
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,036
<i>Hey, Becky, it's me.</i>

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,779
<i>Look, I've tried to console you </i>
<i>every way I know how.</i>

66
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,346
<i>But I...</i>

67
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,828
<i>I can't help you </i>
<i>if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

68
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:09,439
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

69
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,441
<i>So whenever</i>
<i>you stop hating on me,</i>

70
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,922
<i>I am here.</i>

71
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,475
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

72
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,523
<i>This is just the voice mail.</i>

73
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,089
<i>You've reached Dan.</i>

74
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,917
<i>Just leave a message, </i>
<i>I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

75
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,658
<i>Get it off at the beep.</i>

76
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,747
Hey.

77
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,881
Miss you.

78
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:11,327
Dad, what?
Are you stalking me now?

79
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,068
No, I just don't know
what else to do,

80
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,722
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

81
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,288
Take a hint.

82
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,507
I... I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

83
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,204
"Ridiculous"?

84
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,816
You told me I shouldn't be
so broken up about him,

85
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,948
because he was
- an asshole.
- No.

86
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,994
I said that maybe
he didn't belong
on this pedestal

87
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,865
that you were
putting him up on,

88
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,259
that he wasn't this martyr
that you've been
making him out to be.

89
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,043
This is how
you console your daughter?

90
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,394
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

91
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:38,485
I don't want to move on.
I miss him!

92
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,878
Every day, I miss the way
he looked at me.

93
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,227
I miss the way
he made me feel.

94
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,315
- Sweetie.
- Don't!

95
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,578
Don't what?

96
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,449
What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

97
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,190
- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving.
Stop it.

98
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,583
Fuck off!

99
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,367
You don't get to
talk to me like that.

100
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,326
Your mother and I,
we raised you
better than that.

101
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,154
So getting shit-faced

102
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,679
and pushing the people away
that love you,

103
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,724
it's not gonna work.

104
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:01,856
All right, look,

105
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,554
a horrible thing
happened to you,

106
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,861
but you have to start
living your life again.

107
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,515
All right?

108
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,168
There's a whole
big wide world out there
that needs you

109
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,866
and believe it or not,
I need you.

110
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,869
Let me give you
a ride home.

111
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,394
I'd rather walk.

112
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,138
Let me ask you something.

113
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,923
If roles reversed,

114
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,752
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

115
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,841
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

116
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,757
Drowning in booze,
grief, sorrow,

117
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,759
whatever the hell this is?

118
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,154
He's not.

119
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,764
And you damn well know it.

120
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,507
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

121
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,207
Do you know
what I need, Dad?

122
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,471
I need you
to leave me alone.

123
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:01,219
God damn it.

124
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,492
<i>The number you have called </i>
<i>has been disconnected.</i>

125
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,886
No.

126
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,193
No!

127
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,452
- Hi!
- Hey.

128
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:03,151
You look, um...

129
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,587
- Awful.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,502
Yeah, like
really freakin' awful.

131
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,808
Well, come here.

132
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,815
So, what brings you back?

133
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,468
Are you finally ready
to rest?

134
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,254
I'll rest when I'm dead.

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,605
I have something
that's planned.

136
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,259
And I need
a partner in crime.

137
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:30,047
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

138
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,745
He didn't know
who else to turn to.

139
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,834
And he said that
you were in a bad place.

140
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,227
- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.

141
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,533
It's coming up on a year.

142
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,666
He doesn't want you
to be alone.

143
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,711
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

144
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,671
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there,

145
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,848
is my best friend
stuck in here with him.

146
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,241
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

147
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,416
You're not gonna like it,

148
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,244
but just try to keep
an open mind.

149
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,550
Look...

150
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,816
The B-67 TV Tower.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,818
It's only a six-hour drive
from here.

152
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,864
I was planning on
climbing it this weekend

153
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:06,170
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

154
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,871
It would be an adventure,

155
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,135
like old times.

156
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,224
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

157
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,054
I just...
I haven't climbed since...

158
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,098
I get it.

159
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,232
But if you don't
confront your fears,

160
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,755
you are always
going to be afraid.

161
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,628
What is it that
Dan used to say?

162
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:32,849
Don't die if you wanna live

163
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,547
or keep living
even if you're dying.

164
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,332
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

165
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,160
No, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,640
Hunter, I just... I can't.

167
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,035
It's like
I know I can't do it,
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,776
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,778
- I can't.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

170
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,737
It's okay.

171
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,690
Morning, princess.

172
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:35,564
What's wrong?

173
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,784
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

174
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,570
That's what Dan used to say.

175
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,008
Let's do it.

176
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,490
Let's climb your stupid tower.

177
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,579
Oh, my God, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

178
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,502
I've never
actually seen this video.

179
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,766
Shit, I was really ripped.

180
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,203
Yeah! You're awesome.

181
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,379
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

182
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,166
Aw!

183
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,343
Holy shit!
Look at your beaming face.

184
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,084
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

185
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,129
I don't know. It's an oldie.

186
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,392
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

187
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,307
- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.

188
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,527
It's nothing.
Just some guy.

189
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,182
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

190
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,631
<i>Yo, what's up, guys?</i>

191
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,981
<i>Danger D,</i>
<i>and I'm back stateside, yo,</i>

192
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,940
<i>hashtag, super badass.</i>

193
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,551
Okay, in my defense,

194
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,727
I may act like
a total dick on camera,

195
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,815
but it's worth it.

196
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,338
I get paid for this shit.

197
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,601
It's enough
to keep me traveling
and you know me,

198
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,256
I have to be doing
dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping,

199
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,258
so I might as well
monetize that.

200
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:04,044
I'm just saying
if you're gonna be
a YouTuber,

201
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,002
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

202
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,744
- Natural born click-bait.
- No.

203
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,878
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

204
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,231
Excuse me?

205
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,320
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

206
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,061
Power ain't free, ma'am.

207
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:24,368
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

208
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,587
We can't find it on the map.

209
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,982
You don't need a map.

210
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,592
You see that light
way up there?

211
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,030
That's your tower.

212
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,119
That's insanely high.

213
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,906
What's with the light?

214
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:40,863
I thought you said
it was out of commission.

215
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,474
So aircraft can see it.

216
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,868
You know, this was once
the tallest structure
in the U.S.

217
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,133
Now it's just this old relic.

218
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,222
They're due to tear it down
next winter.

219
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,095
Becky?

220
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,010
Becky?

221
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,055
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

222
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,275
What are you doing?

223
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,496
A very cool life hack.

224
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,413
Now I'm just gonna
line up the prongs

225
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,546
with the elements in the lamp.

226
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,677
And...

227
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,117
How's that
for a dumb YouTuber?

228
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,443
Hey, honey.

229
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,358
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

230
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:48,888
I love you.

231
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,982
You're not gonna say it back?

232
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,506
I am saying it.

233
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,421
One...

234
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:02,771
Four...

235
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,295
Three...

236
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:07,732
I love you.

237
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,930
Hey, come on, Becks.
Sun's up.

238
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,504
What up, <i>El Capitan?</i>

239
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,551
I don't know,
but something's up,

240
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,639

Are you live streaming?

242
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,039
No, dude.
Shoot now, post later.

243
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,605
Oh, good.
I don't wanna be in it.

<i>Eight more lives, baby!</i>

258

Shit.

259
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,177
Looks like
we're walking from here.

260
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,092
- How far?
- I don't know.

261
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,705
Like a mile?

262
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,055
Maybe two-ish?

263
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,626
Damn, it's hot.

264
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,976
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

265
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,762
We've got enough water,
you think?

266
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:50,112
Water's check.

Nah, we'll be back in time

271

276

Just go. Go!

277
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,104
Poor thing.

278
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,283

<i>Survival of the fittest, right?</i>

That's funny.

287
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,581
I wonder
how many of your followers
are serial killers.

288
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,933
Holy shit.

289
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,415
Looks a lot bigger
up close, right?

290
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,549
This is sick.

291
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,813
This is awful.

292
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,512
Hey, guys!

293
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,470
Danger D here.

294
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:31,300
And we are at the foot
of this stomach-churningly
massive

295
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,955
fourth-highest structure
in the U.S.

296
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,218
<i>We're gonna begin</i>
<i>our grueling journey</i>

297
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,829
<i>with an 1,800-foot</i>
<i>ladder climb</i>

298
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,310
inside a steel cage.

299
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:42,659
And then after the cage...

300
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,055
...we have a 200-foot,
vertigo-inspiring mast

301
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,709
with an external ladder.

302
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:51,712
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

303
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,758
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

304
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:57,935
<i>The ledge.</i>
<i>The top of the world, Ma.</i>

<i>Hunter?</i>

306
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,508
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

307
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,162
Babe, of course you can.

308
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,990
No, um, I really can't.
I'm, like...

309
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,819
I'm petrified.
I'm, like, shaking.

310
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:13,995
I'm here.

311
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,606
Take a breath.

312
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,785
After Dan died,
I was afraid
of my own shadow.

313
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,875
But I pushed through.

314
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,487
I overcame the fear.
I took control.

315
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,665
Do not let this fear
consume you.

316
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,798
Come at it head on
and kick its ass.

317
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,106
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

318
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,370
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

319
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,679
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

320
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,508
So shut your shit.

321
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,857
And let's do this.

322
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,817
God, Hunter.

323
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,515
You know,
that's the kind of shit

324
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,256
you should be posting
on Instagram.

325
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
Come on.

326
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,916
Dude, this is so cool.

327
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,353
Holy shit.

328
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,313
Look at this.

329
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,316
Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

330
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,058
What are you getting us into?

331
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't worry.

332
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,453
We've got 50 feet of rope
between us.

333
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,411
We're clipped in
and we're all good.

334
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,022
Okay.

335
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,372
One rung at a time,

336
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,590
and let me know
if you have to rest.

337
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:00,884
Okay, okay.

338
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,373
See?

339
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,592
It's easy.

340
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,597
Sure.

341
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,383
You're doing great.
Come on.

342
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,298
You okay?

343
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,084
No.

344
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,782
You're doing great.

345
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
Come on.

346
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:52,996
Hunter?

347
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,392
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

348
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,350
Can we rest a moment?

349
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:00,656
I need a drink.

350
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,701
Of course.

351
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:06,183
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

352
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:11,493
Perfect spot.

353
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,844
Wanna know something crazy?

354
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,194
What?

355
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,848
Halfway up.

356
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,764
That means
we've climbed
about 1,000 feet.

357
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:24,071
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

358
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,291
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

359
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,990
Whoa!

360
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,906
There's the motel.
And the diner.

361
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:36,257
No way. Looks like
a little toy town.

362
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,611
Let's just get this
over with.

363
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:43,656
Yeah.

364
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:48,704
Come on.

365
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:49,749
Catch up.

366
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,987
That's it.

367
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,815
Becky, you're doing amazing.

368
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,777
Come on!

369
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,126
Come on, Becky!

370
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,014
Okay.

371
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:40,539
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

372
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,715
One step at a time, okay.
You got this.

373
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,720
The next 200 feet
is external.

374
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,025
I'm not gonna lie.

375
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,461
It's gonna get
a little bit crazy

376
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,028
when we're out of the cage
in the open.

377
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,203
But don't panic.

378
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,739
Hunter.

379
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,175
Hunter!

380
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,698
Hunter! Hunter!

381
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,353
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

382
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:15,269
Okay.

383
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,718
Hunter?

384
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,241
I'm here.

385
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,069
It's just like 200 feet more,
that's all.

386
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,680
I can't!

387
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,333
Yes, you can!

388
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:40,120
Just look up and only up.

389
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,606
You're doing great.
You got this.

390
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:51,740
Okay.

391
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,394
Okay.

392
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,754
Okay.

393
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,125
Yeah! You're killing it!

394
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,213
Whoo!

395
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,349
You're okay.

396
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,569
Remember, only look up.

397
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:46,447
What the hell are we doing?

398
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,536
Hey!

399
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,190
Stop overthinking.

400
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,974
- How?
- I don't know.

401
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,629
Concentrate on
something else, like...

402
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,415
Sing a, a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

403
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,942
Okay, okay.

404
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,292
Okay.

405
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,868
Down!

406
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:18,653
I wouldn't have
picked that one.

407
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,830
Wow.

408
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:23,702
Okay. Okay, Becks,

409
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,922
this is gonna look
a little bit worse
than it is.

410
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,838
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

411
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,933
Becky, if I let you
go back now,

412
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,369
fear wins.

413
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,981
And I'm not going
to let that happen.

414
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,321
It's okay, Becks.

415
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,455
It's okay.

416
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:22,804
I've got your weight.

417
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,982
Thanks. Okay.

418
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:45,914
Reach up.

419
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,046
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

420
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,577
Okay.

421
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,188
Smooth as sailing
to the top now.

422
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,320
You got this.

423
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,107
I actually really
do hate you, Hunter.

424
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,545
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

425
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,029
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

426
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,944
Sorry.

427
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:25,214
What was that?

428
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,738
Come on,
we're almost there.

429
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,222
- Come on.
- Okay.

430
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,297
Wow.

431
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,172
Becky, you're not gonna
believe this.

432
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,652
- You gotta come up here.
- I'm coming.

433
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,221
- Okay.
- Whoo!

434
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,310
Okay.

435
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,098
Hunter.

436
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,629
Hey, trust me.

437
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:35,937
Okay, okay.

438
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,428
Fuck, Becky!

439
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,299
Oh, I'm here.
Oh, my God.

440
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,093
Oh, my God.

441
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,616
We did it, Becks!

442
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:03,791
I knew you could.

443
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,054
Whoo!

444
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,812
Whoo!

445
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:29,034
Here we go!

446
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,909
On top
of the goddamn world!

447
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,302
Whoo!

448
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,133
Do you wanna try?

449
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:44,745
Shit! Hunter, stop!

450
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:46,529
Just focus on
getting a good shot.

451
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,401
I didn't wear
this stupid bra
for nothing.

452
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,619
No.

453
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,881
- No, Hunter.
- Whoo!

454
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,320
Swoop it around!

455
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,411
Seize your day!

456
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,717
Okay. Oh, my God.

457
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,079
How'd it look?

458
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,603
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

459
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,955
Let's get this bad boy back.

460
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,654
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

461
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,353
Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.

462
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:28,745
Your turn.

463
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,665
What? No.

464
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,624
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

465
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,149
No. No, Hunter.

466
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,108
The old Becky
would have done it.

467
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,025
Just saying...Dude.

468
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,418
Here. I'll hold your hand.

469
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,035
- Okay.
- Yeah?

470
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,210
Okay.

471
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,690
Shit.

472
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,344
Come on, come on!

473
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,173
You can do this.

474
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,308
You can do it.

475
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:12,702
Okay, okay, okay.

476
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:15,705
- I got you.
- Okay.

477
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,185
Okay. Whoa!

478
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:18,926
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

479
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,710
- I've got you, Becks.
- Oh, my God.

480
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,104
Careful over the ledge.

481
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:26,107
Take it easy.

482
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:28,892
Okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

483
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:36,639
Open your eyes.

484
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,340
Whoo-hoo!

485
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,652
Okay, just one more.

486
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,398
You're coming up right now.

487
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,621
My God, you did it.

488
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,537
You did it!
You did it, you idiot.

489
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,672
Yes! Look.

490
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,979
- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my God.

491
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,894
Whoa!

492
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,553
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything,

493
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,294
I want you to look at these

494
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,296
and know
that you have nothing
to be afraid of.

495
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,691
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

496
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,128
I'm really proud of you.

497
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,869
Dan would be, too.

498
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,005
Yeah.

499
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,362
Okay.

500
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,930
Okay, it's time.

501
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,751
You and I were one, Dan.

502
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,277
And whenever
I needed a laugh,

503
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,237
you told me
one of your shit jokes.

504
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,331
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on,

505
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,506
it was yours.

506
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,990
And now you're gone
and I'm...

507
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,430
I don't feel whole anymore.

508
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:04,570
I miss you, um,
just so much and I'm...

509
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,964
I love you.

510
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:10,750
Goodbye, Dan.

511
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,421
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

512
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:33,381
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

513
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:36,079
Yeah.

514
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,168
I've just been
so far away for so long.

515
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,868
It just didn't
really feel real
until then.

516
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,396
Come on.

517
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,619
Let's get back down
on earth, okay?

518
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,490
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

519
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,579
I've needed to pee
since we passed
the Eiffel Tower.

520
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,669
Okay?

521
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,802
Okay, home time.

522
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,325
Home time.

523
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,458
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

524
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,639
Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.

525
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,031
Oh, stop.

526
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,993
- I've got you.
- Okay, slowly.

527
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,342
Okay.

528
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,126
Uh, I'm just getting
a stitch here.

529
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,780
Okay, okay.

530
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:43,756
Okay.

531
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,600
Hunter!

532
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,176
No!

533
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:25,667
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, holy shit.

534
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:30,629
- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.

535
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:31,717
Hunter!

536
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:41,857
Oh, God,
please don't drop me.

537
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,776
Don't drop me.

538
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,094
Becks?

539
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,057
I've got you, Becks.

540
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,584
I can see the ladder.

541
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,991
I've got you.

542
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,606
I just died almost.

543
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,742
Oh, my God.

544
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,223
Did that really just happen?

545
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,486
Oh, my...Jesus Christ!

546
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,748
I wish we'd filmed that.

547
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:50,404
Oh, you're here.

548
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,580
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

549
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:53,886
Yeah.

550
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:54,974
Okay, take two.

551
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,898
Oh, no.

552
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:07,943
The ladder.

553
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:09,815
It's gone.

554
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,617
Hunter, how do we get down?

555
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:30,836
Shit!

556
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,359
Please tell me there's
a way to go down.

557
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,535
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

558
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,363
- No.
- Oh, no.

559
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:37,973
No, no, no.

560
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:40,280
Um, there must be something.

561
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,588
No. Shit.

562
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,328
I don't have a signal.

563
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,984
I don't get it, either.

564
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,726
I'm sure there's something,

565
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,336
I'm sure
it's just really spotty
up here.

566
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,947
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

567
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,557
We're gonna be okay.

568
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,819
Freaking out is not
gonna help anything
right now.

569
00:41:57,863 --> 00:41:59,212
So just take a breath.

570
00:41:59,255 --> 00:42:00,692
We're stuck on
a pizza-sized platform

571
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,345
in the middle of nowhere,
Hunter.

572
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,783
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

573
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,393
It's not gonna help, okay.

574
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,003
It's okay.

575
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,573
I'm sure we can...Wait, Hunter.
Hunter, Hunter.

576
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:13,748
Look at this.

577
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,620
Oh, my God.

578
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:17,709
- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.

579
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:19,928
We have a flare.

580
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:20,973
Okay.

581
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,019
Okay.

582
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,194
- This is great news.
- Okay.

583
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,423
Oh, shit,
our bag is down there.

584
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:40,209
Oh, man,
our water's in there.

585
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,343
Shit, we're gonna
die of thirst.

586
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:45,127
- No. No.
- We don't have water.

587
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,607
No, think about it...
The noise!

588
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,043
That is how you die
when you're stranded.

589
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:49,654
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

590
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,439
there is no way
nobody heard that.

591
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,615
Okay? I'm...
I'm sure that there

592
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,966
are like multiple calls to 911
as we speak.

593
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,359
Do you really think so?

594
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:01,404
Yeah.

595
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:02,536
Yeah, the cavalry
is coming, okay?

596
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,843
We just...
We just have to wait.

597
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:06,801
Okay. Okay.

598
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,500
Holy...

599
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:11,980
- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.

600
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,634
My God.

601
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,550
What the hell?

602
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,160
I didn't even notice this.

603
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,423
Whoa!

604
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,209
- Um, whoa!
- Come here.
Let's compress it.

605
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:24,863
- Are you okay? I know.
- Ow! It really hurts.

606
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,342
Can you just like...I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

607
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:27,909
- Can you warn me?
- Okay.

608
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,694
- Count of three?
- Yeah. One...

609
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:32,697
Two... Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

610
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,089
- I know.
- Oh, man.

611
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,048
Are you okay?

612
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:38,354
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

613
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,318
I really have to pee.

614
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,059
- Just go.
- No.

615
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,365
- Just pee.
- No, it's fine.
I can hold it.

616
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,889
I just need
to get comfortable.

617
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:01,551
Can you go any farther?

618
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:03,684
It's, like, spraying.

619
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,686
Okay, careful
- over the ledge.
- I'm trying.

620
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,688
Stop looking at me.

621
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:10,604
Oh, God. That's a relief.

622
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,390
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

623
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,610
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

624
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,481
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

625
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:21,484
All right.

626
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,882
All right!

627
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:35,847
Do you really think
someone's coming?

628
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,372
One million percent.

629
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:23,372

<i>you're an asshole.</i>

653
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,644
<i>Hmm.</i> <i>Yeah.</i>

654
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,472
<i>Secondly,</i>

655
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,431
<i>um...</i>

656
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:27,480
<i>And this is</i>
<i>gonna sound stupid,</i>

657
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:30,962
<i>but I do this because of Dan.</i>

658
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:38,578
What happened...

659
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:40,885
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

660
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:47,587
And I want to spread
that message,
that life is short,

661
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,806
too short.

662
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,070
So, you gotta use every moment.

663
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:55,551
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

664
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,694
That was amazing.

665
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:12,220
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

666
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,919
That was really great.

667
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,402
Should I kill Danger D?

668
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:21,708
Mm-hmm.

669
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,362
I'll help you
bury the body.

670
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:42,381
Oh, shit.

671
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:44,078
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

672
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,427
Can I see?

673
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,255
Just past the gate,
a little over.

674
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:50,650
Yeah.

675
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:52,695
That looks abandoned.

676
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,221
It's been five hours.

677
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:58,005
If anyone called 911,
they'd be here by now.

678
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:16,502
Oh, my God.

679
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:18,765
Holy shit.

680
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,942
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

681
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,378
but we definitely
did down there.

682
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:24,902
Remember,
I got all those likes?

683
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,077
Shit.

684
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:28,818
Okay.

685
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,211
Okay, so we don't know
at what point
we lost service.

686
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,821
Maybe it was just up here

687
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:33,388
because of some
like interference with the...

688
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:34,912
- The broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.

689
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,652
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

690
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:38,393
Okay, we have
50 feet of rope.

691
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:40,134
We can try to fish
for coverage.

692
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:42,484
I just need something
to secure this with.

693
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,747
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

694
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:45,792
Okay.

695
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:48,142
Okay.

696
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:49,622
Can you message
emergency services?

697
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:50,928
I don't think so.

698
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,146
But I have
over 60,000 followers.

699
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,539
Okay.

700
00:48:53,582 --> 00:49:00,763
"Help us.
Stuck on B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

701
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,026
It's ready to post.

702
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,723
We should hear it
when it sends.

703
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:11,687
Come on, come on.

704
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:13,341
Okay.

705
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,300
Okay.

706
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:21,132
Let's see
if I can get lower.

707
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:26,006
Just be careful.

708
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,226
Got it, okay. Come on.

709
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,189
That's the end.

710
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,409
- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't, either.

711
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:38,932
I don't think it posted.

712
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,850
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

713
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:46,766
What? What do you mean?
Just...

714
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:47,941
I've got it.
I've got an idea.

715
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,995
- Careful, Hunter.
- Feels solid.

716
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:02,042
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

717
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,354
Okay.

718
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,225
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

719
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:12,313
- Careful.
- Shit.

720
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:13,923
Oh, my God, Hunter.

721
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,838
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

722
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,057
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

723
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:21,627
Careful. Shit.

724
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:31,463
I don't hear anything.
Nothing.

725
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:32,942
Okay, you need
to come back up.

726
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:37,860
Shit.

727
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:46,478
I got it.

728
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:58,490
Did it post?

729
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:00,840
No.

730
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,278
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

731
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,544
Wait, hold on.

732
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,720
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

733
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:12,808
Yeah.

734
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:14,897
What if we just drop the phone?

735
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:16,464
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters
into a million pieces?

736
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,031
Not if we reinforce it somehow,

737
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,598
so it doesn't like
the egg drop challenge.

738
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,426
Yeah. Okay, shit.

739
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,472
Um, we just need
something to...
To put it in.

740
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,170
- Yeah.
- This.

741
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:28,694
It's welded on.

742
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,435
My shoe's too flimsy.

743
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:33,307
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

744
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,961
Okay, got it.

745
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:40,271
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

746
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,839
Yeah. Okay.

747
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,320
Okay.

748
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,282
We still need something
more substantial.

749
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:54,067
Oh, Hunter.

750
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,634
Your push-up bra.

751
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,984
- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.

752
00:51:58,027 --> 00:51:59,986
Dying to get
this thing off, anyway.

753
00:52:01,553 --> 00:52:03,207
Thank you, VS.

754
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:06,993
Okay.

755
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:08,603
Hope it's strong enough.

756
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,431
Shove it real good.

757
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:14,957
Okay.

758
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:18,744
Here goes nothing.

759
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,195
Did it work?

760
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,544
I don't know.
I can't tell.

761
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,039
Do you see anything?

762
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:54,693
No, nothing.

763
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:56,912
Don't worry.

764
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,001
They're coming.

765
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,055
Holy shit!
There's a freaking guy!

766
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:11,405
- What?
- Oh, my God. Yes.

767
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:12,711
And a dog, too.

768
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,802
- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!

769
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,634
Look, I sent you
the check, man.
Come on.

770
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:25,158
I need that...

771
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,073
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

772
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,514
Parker.

773
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:36,865
Come! Come on, boy.

774
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,215
No, no, no, no, no.

775
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:40,434
Shit!

776
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,089
Hey!

777
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:46,701
Let's go.

778
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,792
God damn it,
they're getting away.

779
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:06,808
Parker.

780
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:09,898
He got the shoe.

781
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,596
- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!

782
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:22,259
- Hey!
- Hey!

783
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,564
- He's walking!
- Hey!

784
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:32,312
- No, no, no, turn around!
- Turn around!

785
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,574
Right here!

786
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:34,662
Hey!

787
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:38,275
- Shit! Shit!
- Hey!

788
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:42,540
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

789
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,324
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

790
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,673
This might be
our only chance.

791
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,762
No, no, no,
he's not looking.

792
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,852
Wait.

793
00:54:50,896 --> 00:54:52,724
Hold on.
There's somebody by the RV.

794
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,726
He's setting up
a grill or some shit.

795
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,162
Okay.

796
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:57,772
And we'll fire the flare
when the sun goes down

797
00:54:57,816 --> 00:54:59,600
in like...
In like an hour.

798
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:00,819
We've only got
one shot at this.

799
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:04,126
Oh, damn.

800
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,258
What?

801
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,826
- They're making ribs.
- Oh, no.

802
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,393
And they have
really cold beer.

803
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:10,568
Don't.

804
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,803
These guys
are definitely a couple.

805
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:32,416
Dirty weekend away.

806
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:33,634
I'm jealous.

807
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:53,915
Hey, hey, hey.
They're finishing up.

808
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,352
It's now or never,
fire the flare.

809
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,484
- Is it dark enough?
- Uh-huh.

810
00:55:57,528 --> 00:55:59,834
Okay.

811
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:01,183
- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?

812
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:02,968
- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it.

813
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:04,752
I cocked it, maybe
there's a safety
or something?

814
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:06,537
Shit. Okay,
they're going in,
they're going in.

815
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,799
You have to do
- the flare now.
- I'm trying.

816
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:08,974
- Get it to go.
- It's stuck.

817
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:10,454
Okay, I got it. I got it.

818
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,592
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

819
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,855
- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.

820
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:24,859
Hey, sons of bitches,
up here!

821
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,949
Holy shit! Check this out.

822
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:30,561
Up here! Hey!

823
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:31,736
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

824
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:32,824
- What?
- They can see us.

825
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,042
Oh, my God!

826
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,435
Holy shit! Oh, my God,

827
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,829
let me see, let me see,
let me see.

828
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:39,439
Oh, my God,
they're coming.

829
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:41,746
Hey!

830
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,968
Holy shit,
they found the car.

831
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,622
They found our car,
they found our car.

832
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,887
They have a... A crowbar.

833
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,280
They're probably
gonna open the gate.

834
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:56,978
- Okay.
- Okay.

835
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:58,153
Wait, what the hell?

836
00:56:58,197 --> 00:56:59,546
Wait, what's going on?

837
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,548
- They stopped.
- What?

838
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:03,942
Quit chatting,
go open the freakin' gate.

839
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,771
No. No, no, no.
What the hell?

840
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:07,946
They're stealing
my freakin' car!

841
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,077
What?

842
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:11,297
- No, you sons of bitches!
- Hey!

843
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,430
You asshole!
What the hell?

844
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,344
No! I need to see it!

845
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:21,307
- Oh, my God. No, no!
- Die, you freakin' assholes!

846
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,621
Okay. New rule.

847
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:18,146
If somebody
falls off the tower,

848
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,192
they bring the cell phone
with them.

849
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:22,281
And call for help
on the way down.

850
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:26,372
And maybe post that video.

851
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:30,507
Kidding, ish.

852
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:35,424
Yeah, my leg.

853
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:37,514
I could eat aspirin
like Skittles right now.

854
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:40,908
Yeah.

855
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,562
It's looking a little funky.

856
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:44,390
Could use
some washing, here.

857
00:58:56,271 --> 00:58:57,272
I'm sorry.

858
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:08,893
We'll just
keep it wrapped up.

859
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,071
What's wrong?

860
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:19,120
Dan could
never say the words,
"I love you."

861
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,908
1-4-3.

862
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,131
1-4-3.

863
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,748
Becky, I...How long?

864
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:43,623
Four months.

865
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,978
It was a huge mistake.

866
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:54,765
I'm sorry,
I am so, so sorry.

867
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:57,376
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

868
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,465
For falling in love
with the same guy.

869
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,673
Who made the move?

870
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,675
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

871
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:39,853
He did.

872
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:45,859
But it was
a huge, huge mistake,
Becks.

873
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:50,429
No.

874
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,998
A mistake is a kiss.
A one-night stand.

875
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:57,828
You said you loved him, so...

876
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,876
It got out of hand.

877
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,881
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him.
I mean...

878
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,971
He listened to me,
he was...

879
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,017
He was just different
than every other douchebag

880
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,366
that I'd ever dated and...

881
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,370
And I'd never
felt that way before.

882
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,330
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

883
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:23,941
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks,

884
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,638
how messed up
this all was.

885
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:29,773
I loved him,

886
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:34,429
but I love you more,
so I ended it.

887
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:40,784
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

888
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,222
And after Dan died, I...

889
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,573
I just didn't
have the strength

890
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:48,879
to be there for you.

891
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:51,185
To be strong enough
for you, so...

892
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,622
So, I ran away.

893
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,583
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you,

894
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,194
and now we're stuck
on this stupid,
freaking tower

895
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:01,935
in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

896
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,633
And it's all my fault.

897
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:09,377
I am so, so sorry.

898
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:25,932
What's that?

899
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:28,500
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

900
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:32,330
It's been 24 hours.

901
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,422
I think it's time to accept

902
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,337
that either
your 60,000 followers
don't give a shit

903
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,992
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

904
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,256
Okay.

905
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:48,607
Well, we've got
one more shot.
Your phone.

906
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,391
Yeah, no padding
this time, though.

907
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,176
Even less of a chance.

908
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:53,699
And if this fails
we really don't
have any hope.

909
01:03:57,703 --> 01:03:59,487
How long till
we die of thirst?

910
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,403
It's just killing me
that our water

911
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,579
is just right down there
in that bag.

912
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,757
Yeah, with the drone.

913
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:11,021
We could've used that
to get help.

914
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:14,198
We could have flown it
back to our motel
with a good old fashioned note.

915
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:21,596
Wait, maybe I can get it.

916
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:24,512
What do you mean?

917
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,079
You said it was too smooth.
No footholds.

918
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,689
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

919
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:29,996
I think the rope
was long enough
to reach it.

920
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:34,696
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

921
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,222
Yeah, I seriously think
I can get it.

922
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,015
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

923
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,844
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

924
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,890
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

925
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:00,505
Besides...

926
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:02,594
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

927
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:14,649
Hunter.

928
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:19,437
Be careful.

929
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:23,615
I'm sorry, Becks.

930
01:05:25,182 --> 01:05:26,444
I love you.

931
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:39,848
Okay.

932
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,816
Are you okay?

933
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,861
Yeah.

934
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:55,603
Yeah, all good.

935
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,134
Okay.

936
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:12,272
Okay.

937
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:21,455
Hunter, careful.

938
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,371
Shit.

939
01:06:25,677 --> 01:06:27,940
I can't quite reach it.

940
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,159
Just come back up.

941
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,943
- We'll attach it lower.
- Come on.

942
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,945
Shit.

943
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:38,211
I think I can
drop myself lower.

944
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:40,083
What?

945
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:42,476
What the hell
are you doing, Hunter?

946
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:44,957
Hunter!

947
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:53,922
Shit.

948
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:04,368
- I think I can swing to it.
- Hunter, no!

949
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:06,718
Hunter! Come back up!

950
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,067
Hunter, no!

951
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,068
Hunter!

952
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:17,033
Are you okay?

953
01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:20,384
Yeah.

954
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:27,521
Is there a way down?

955
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:30,437
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

956
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,015
Water.

957
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:49,195
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, Hunter.

958
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,545
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

959
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:56,594
Uh.

960
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:58,857
Shit.

961
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:02,687
Can... Can you reach it?

962
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,787
<i>sat on the wall</i>

963
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,442
Oh, my God.

964
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:34,588
Shit.

965
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,465
- You okay?
- Yeah.

966
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,119
I have an idea.

967
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,260
Okay.

968
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:56,610
I'm gonna try
to hook it on with this,

969
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:59,352
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

970
01:08:59,396 --> 01:09:01,789
- Okay?
- That's amazing.

971
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:04,052
That's some
good MacGyver shit
right there.

972
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:35,127
Oh, come on. Please.
Come on.

973
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:40,219
- You did it!
- Okay.

974
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:43,614
Okay. I'm gonna
jump onto this.

975
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:45,790
I'm gonna need
your help to pull me up.

976
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,226
- Okay.
- Get ready, Becks.

977
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,315
- Okay.
- Okay.

978
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:51,187
Okay.

979
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,366
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

980
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:07,725
Shit.

981
01:10:07,768 --> 01:10:09,944
Hunter, are you okay?
You okay?

982
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:15,211
Okay. I'm okay.

983
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:17,256
Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

984
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,779
Work together to pull me up.

985
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:22,218
- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.

986
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:25,438
Okay? Okay, now!

987
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,688
I can almost
reach the ladder.

988
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:04,042
Almost there, Becks.

989
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,572
Okay.

990
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:46,258
Becky! I landed on the bag!

991
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,347
Oh, my God...
Are you okay?

992
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:52,046
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

993
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,005
You're gonna
have to pull me up, okay?

994
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,311
Okay. Okay.

995
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:00,185
I got you.

996
01:12:37,918 --> 01:12:38,963
Oh, shit.

997
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,229
Oh, no. Are you okay?

998
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:46,840
Shit. I thought
you died there.

999
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:48,581
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

1000
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:51,279
Yeah, that was scary.

1001
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:00,724
- We should ration it.
- Okay.

1002
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:01,768
You're right.

1003
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,424
Is there any food in there?

1004
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,861
No, it's just
your cherry lip balm.

1005
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:10,168
I don't think
you can eat that.

1006
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,431
Okay. It's getting dark.

1007
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:14,999
I think it's now or never
on that drone.

1008
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:18,916
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

1009
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,179
Okay, the receipt
from the diner.

1010
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:24,748
- A pen... Do you have a pen?
- Eye liner in here.

1011
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,140
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

1012
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,754
"Help.

1013
01:13:30,797 --> 01:13:36,107
"Stuck on top of B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

1014
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:39,284
Yeah, perfect.

1015
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,595
Okay. See that?

1016
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:48,206
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

1017
01:13:48,249 --> 01:13:50,643
It leads to the motel.

1018
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,471
Let's do this while
we still have light.

1019
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:57,433
Okay.

1020
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:02,699
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow
the line of the road.

1021
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:04,831
Let it drift down
- as it goes.
- Okay.

1022
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,368
Okay.

1023
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:22,719
Okay, we're almost
past the gate.

1024
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:24,068
Oh, my God.

1025
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:25,504
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

1026
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:27,550
- It's running out of juice.
- Oh, shit.

1027
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:30,204
Hit retrieve.
Or has it gone too far?

1028
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,163
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!

1029
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:33,947
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

1030
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:35,514
Shit. It's dropping.

1031
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:36,559
Hit retrieve,
hit retrieve...Hunter.

1032
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:37,690
- ...hit retrieve.
- Okay.

1033
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,563
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

1034
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:42,173
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

1035
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:43,696
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

1036
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,831
- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.

1037
01:14:49,441 --> 01:14:50,486
We'll grab it
when it gets close.

1038
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:51,530
Okay.

1039
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,709
Okay.
We've got this.

1040
01:14:58,276 --> 01:14:59,756
Get it, Becks, get it.

1041
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:05,152
Nice! Good job.

1042
01:15:17,774 --> 01:15:19,689
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

1043
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,126
Maybe just turn it off

1044
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:23,780
and once it's rested,
it will have more juice.

1045
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:26,434
It's never gonna
be enough. Hunter.

1046
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:37,794
What are we gonna do?

1047
01:15:37,837 --> 01:15:40,013
Hey, we're not
gonna panic.

1048
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,538
We're gonna stay calm.

1049
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,540
We're gonna
figure it out, okay?

1050
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,628
There's gotta be a way.

1051
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:50,589
Are we gonna die?

1052
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,548
No.

1053
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:54,898
No, we're gonna be okay.

1054
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,668
Hunter. Hunter...

1055
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:28,453
Where are you? Hunter...

1056
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:36,809
Hunter...

1057
01:16:38,463 --> 01:16:40,378
Hunter, where are you?

1058
01:16:44,295 --> 01:16:46,471
Hunter. Hunter!

1059
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:50,622
Becky, it's okay.

1060
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,712
You just had a bad dream.

1061
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,714
You're nice and safe,

1062
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:59,065
2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

1063
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:09,902
I have an idea.

1064
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,469
How to charge the drone.

1065
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:14,602
Your dumb life hack.

1066
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,605
Becky, you freakin' genius.

1067
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:27,137
I think
it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

1068
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:48,898
Okay, it's a standard
bulb fitting,

1069
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:50,638
but it's gonna be hot.

1070
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:52,597
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel
like 1,000.

1071
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:59,082
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

1072
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,214
It smells,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

1073
01:19:01,258 --> 01:19:02,259
It's fine.

1074
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:04,261
Okay.

1075
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:09,614
You can do this.

1076
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:19,755
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1077
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,108
Keep going, Becky.

1078
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:31,201
You got this, Becky.

1079
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,430
I can't.

1080
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:44,823
It's okay, it's okay.

1081
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:46,738
I can't.

1082
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,174
You can do it, Becky.

1083
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:49,872
You got it.

1084
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,094
It's okay.

1085
01:19:55,138 --> 01:19:57,444
It's just like pole dancing.

1086
01:19:57,488 --> 01:20:00,230
Um... Okay, <i>Cherry Pie.</i>

1087
01:20:03,102 --> 01:20:06,149
<i>My sweet surprise</i>

1088
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,200
Whoo!

1089
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:19,815
<i>My sweet surprise</i>

1090
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,427
Whoo!

1091
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:28,301
Yes!

1092
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:35,656
You did it,
my little cherry pie.

1093
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,832
Good job!

1094
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:41,271
Okay.
Yeah!

1095
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,316
You did it,
cherry pie!

1096
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,842
All right. All right.

1097
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:49,670
- Okay. Okay.
- Remember, it's hot.

1098
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:53,587
Be careful.

1099
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:14,608
Okay, just think back
to the diner.

1100
01:21:14,652 --> 01:21:16,915
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1101
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:19,135
with the elements
of the bulb socket.

1102
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,751
I don't think
it's long enough.

1103
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:28,622
I think the back prong
doesn't reach.

1104
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,363
Okay, you're gonna need

1105
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:33,366
something small and metal
to carry the current,
like a...

1106
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:36,761
Like a screw
or something that you
can jam in there.

1107
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:39,546
- There isn't anything.
- Jesus. Um...

1108
01:22:08,097 --> 01:22:10,926
It's working!
It's freaking working!

1109
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:12,971
Holy shit, my hero!

1110
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:15,626
Okay, we're gonna need
a full charge.

1111
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:18,281
I don't know.
It just has four lights.

1112
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:20,500
Okay, we have to
charge it all the way.

1113
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,328
Give ourselves the best shot.

1114
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:23,764
You gonna be okay?

1115
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:25,114
Yeah.

1116
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,158
I got this.

1117
01:22:56,623 --> 01:22:57,798
You okay?

1118
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:00,453
Yeah.

1119
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:01,715
Hang in there, Becks.

1120
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,805
Past halfway.

1121
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,176
Get off of me!

1122
01:23:35,488 --> 01:23:38,361
It's okay,
it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

1123
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:41,233
Three lights.

1124
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:47,761
Come on, Becky,
you're so close.

1125
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:56,727
Get the hell away
from me!

1126
01:24:02,863 --> 01:24:03,908
You did it!

1127
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,784
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1128
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,617
Why didn't you
- catch the bag?
- Uh...

1129
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,532
Babe, you okay?

1130
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,195
We need to fly that thing
when the motel
is the busiest.

1131
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,806
Checkout, 10:00 a.m.

1132
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,373
Just a couple of hours.

1133
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:05,143
You know,
he was right about Dan.

1134
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:06,927
He was just
trying to help me.

1135
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:11,628
And I was
so horrible to him.

1136
01:25:14,935 --> 01:25:17,373
If there was
anyone I could text,
it would be him.

1137
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,548
Just to say...

1138
01:25:20,202 --> 01:25:21,768
I'm so sorry.

1139
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:25,598
I love him.

1140
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:33,693
I'm tapping out here.

1141
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,088
Stay with me.

1142
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,004
Try to keep
your mind occupied.

1143
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:42,702
Tell me something,
something that...

1144
01:25:42,746 --> 01:25:44,661
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1145
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:50,145
We would watch wrestling.

1146
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,627
- WWE.
- Yeah.

1147
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,716
I forgot you guys
were into that.

1148
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,022
Yeah.

1149
01:25:58,065 --> 01:26:00,503
It was our thing,
you know.

1150
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:02,113
He was always said

1151
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:07,074
I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1152
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:09,816
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1153
01:26:13,211 --> 01:26:15,387
Name some of
your favorite wrestlers.

1154
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,698
Uh, "Stone Cold"
Steve Austin.

1155
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:25,484
The Rock.

1156
01:26:25,528 --> 01:26:29,096
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1157
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,359
Mankind.

1158
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:33,231
Mankind.

1159
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,235
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1160
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:39,019
I didn't.

1161
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:41,065
Keep going,
you need to stay awake.

1162
01:26:43,589 --> 01:26:44,938
Batista.

1163
01:26:50,683 --> 01:26:52,642
Okay. It's checkout time.

1164
01:26:56,036 --> 01:26:57,429
Okay, here it goes.

1165
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:06,438
Just keep
that shit straight.

1166
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:08,310
Follow the line
of the road.

1167
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:14,794
Come on,
you son of a...

1168
01:27:21,018 --> 01:27:22,889
I'm past the point
of no return,

1169
01:27:22,933 --> 01:27:25,109
so how's the battery?

1170
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:26,415
Should I retrieve?

1171
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:29,026
No, keep going.

1172
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:33,900
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1173
01:27:40,951 --> 01:27:41,995
Oh, shit.

1174
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:50,090
It's gonna work.

1175
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:00,187
Oh, God.

1176
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:05,018
No.

1177
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:09,936
Screw your truck.
Get the drone!

1178
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,242
Get it!

1179
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,815
No, no, no, no!

1180
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:21,774
Go back! Go back.

1181
01:28:21,818 --> 01:28:25,343
No, no, no. Go back!

1182
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,344
Go back!

1183
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:33,003
Fuck, no!

1184
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:24,054
Is that a storm?

1185
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,058
It's kind of beautiful
from up here.

1186
01:29:34,456 --> 01:29:36,719
I can't survive
another night.

1187
01:29:36,762 --> 01:29:38,373
Becky, don't talk like that.

1188
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:43,508
I just...

1189
01:29:43,552 --> 01:29:46,990
- I just wanna sleep.
- You can't sleep.

1190
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:49,558
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1191
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:51,821
They're waiting for you
to give up
so they can attack.

1192
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,435
Survival of the fittest.

1193
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:00,656
You need energy.

1194
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:02,658
We should eat something.

1195
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:04,703
What?

1196
01:30:04,747 --> 01:30:08,185
We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle
of the desert.

1197
01:30:08,228 --> 01:30:10,143
There's no food up here.

1198
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,710
There's always something.

1199
01:30:14,844 --> 01:30:16,411
It's hopeless.

1200
01:30:20,676 --> 01:30:23,069
Let's send
another message.

1201
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:25,332
We can pad the cell
better this time.

1202
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,639
- With what?
- Give me your shoe.

1203
01:30:27,683 --> 01:30:30,468
- I can't.
- Why?

1204
01:30:30,512 --> 01:30:32,862
- It's not up here, is it?
- What?

1205
01:30:35,821 --> 01:30:37,257
It's down there.

1206
01:30:38,694 --> 01:30:40,173
It's on your foot.

1207
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:42,741
Yes.

1208
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:50,749
But I'm down there,
remember?

1209
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:57,713
I fell.

1210
01:31:01,151 --> 01:31:03,719
<i>You can't have the shoe,</i>

1211
01:31:03,762 --> 01:31:05,895
<i>because I didn't</i>
<i>catch the bag.</i>

1212
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:08,506
<i>I bled out.</i>

1213
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:29,614
You didn't really think
your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

1214
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:45,238
You pulled the bag up.

1215
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:56,162
<i>I guess you were</i>
<i>just too afraid</i>

1216
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:59,557
to realize that
you were up here,

1217
01:31:59,601 --> 01:32:01,951
<i>all alone.</i>

1218
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,593
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1219
01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:23,685
<i>I wanted you to know</i>
<i>that I...</i>

1220
01:33:23,728 --> 01:33:25,948
<i>I found my fight again.</i>

1221
01:33:29,908 --> 01:33:31,475
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

1222
01:33:32,868 --> 01:33:34,434
<i>I wanna live.</i>

1223
01:33:36,045 --> 01:33:37,742
<i>I wanna go home,</i>

1224
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:43,313
<i>but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>make it.</i>

1225
01:33:48,884 --> 01:33:51,277
<i>You were right</i>
<i>about everything and I...</i>

1226
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:54,019
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

1227
01:34:00,156 --> 01:34:02,071
<i>By the time you see this...</i>

1228
01:34:04,726 --> 01:34:05,901
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

1229
01:34:14,213 --> 01:34:15,780
<i>I love you.</i>

1230
01:35:51,789 --> 01:35:53,530
That's it! Fuck!

1231
01:36:17,946 --> 01:36:19,338
<i>You need energy.</i>

1232
01:36:20,513 --> 01:36:21,776
<i>You should eat something.</i>

1233
01:36:26,563 --> 01:36:28,304

1235
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,607
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

1236
01:38:29,686 --> 01:38:30,905
Hunter.

1237
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,311
God, I love you.

1238
01:39:19,518 --> 01:39:20,911
I'm sorry.

1239
01:39:21,607 --> 01:39:23,348
I'm so sorry,

1240
01:39:23,392 --> 01:39:25,176
but I really
have to make sure
this gets through.

1241
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,091
God, God, I'm sorry.

1242
01:40:46,431 --> 01:40:47,737
You can't park here.

1243
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,740
Becky! Becky!

1244
01:40:56,659 --> 01:40:57,747
No.

1245
01:40:59,488 --> 01:41:00,750
No.

1246
01:41:03,274 --> 01:41:05,363
Dad?

1247
01:41:05,407 --> 01:41:06,408
Dad?

1248
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:08,932
Dad!

1249
01:41:15,286 --> 01:41:18,028
I thought that was you.

1250
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:21,727
Dad, I love you.
I'm so sorry.

1251
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,426
It's okay.

1252
01:41:26,863 --> 01:41:27,907
I just...

1253
01:41:27,951 --> 01:41:29,605
I just want you to be okay.

1254
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:35,567
I am, you know.

1255
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:36,829
I'm gonna be okay.

1256
01:41:38,004 --> 01:41:39,397
Really.

1257
01:41:54,499 --> 01:41:55,805
Let's go home.

1258
01:41:58,721 --> 01:42:00,114
<i>Life is fleeting.</i>

1259
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,594
<i>Life is short.</i>

1260
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:04,857
<i>Too short.</i>

1261
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:08,209
<i>So, you gotta use</i>

1262

1264
01:42:13,518 --> 01:42:17,566
<i>That would spread</i>
