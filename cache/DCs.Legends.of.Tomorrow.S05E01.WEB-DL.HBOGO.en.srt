1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,760
Where are we?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,840
At the dawn of time.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, look who's finally...

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,640
- Awake.
- Alex?

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,720
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,040
Are, are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,600
I don't know. I'm...

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,280
How did I get here?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,480
and you just looked so peaceful,

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,240
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
The dawn of time.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Dawn of time.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,120
Is that what you were watching
before you nodded off?

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Wait.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,160
What is...

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
This isn't right.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay, well, I mean, it's right.
But it's not right

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
because it's right.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,200
The White Martian did a number
on you last night.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,880
White Martian.
White Martian. White Martian.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Listen, I gotta run.

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,960
{\an5}Kelly and I are trying out
a new indoor rowing class downtown.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
So, are you...

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm fine.

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Okay.

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,160
- Alex?
- Yeah?

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I love you.

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
I love you too.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
- Nia!
<i>- Kara?</i>

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,040
It's good to hear your voice.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,800
Well, it would be better
to see my face.

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,960
Where are you?
The ceremony is about to start.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Ceremony?

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,600
They're awarding
the Nobel Peace Prize any minute.

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,080
Don't worry.
I saved you a seat, but,

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,840
that lady from the Gazette
is giving me angry eyes.

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,120
If you miss this,
Andrea's gonna blow a gasket.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,600
- Please take your seats.
- Good timing.

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,640
Hey, I had a really
weird dream last night.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Could you maybe help me interpret it?

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,080
What happened?

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,440
The world ended.

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
But, like, all the worlds.

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
All of them.

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
That's dramatic, even for us.

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,280
And now, I am proud to introduce

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
the winner of this year's
Nobel Peace Prize, Lex Luthor.

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
Nia?

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
- Nia, am I still dreaming?
- I know, right?

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,240
It is so great when this award goes
to someone who actually deserves it.

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,960
{\an5}We live in dangerous times.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
{\an5}Earth is a dangerous place.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,280
{\an5}I suppose that's why people love
superheroes so much.

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,200
{\an5}The power, the chutzpah...

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,640
{\an5}Of someone who can fly
faster than a speeding bullet.

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
{\an5}But that's what makes this
so special.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
{\an5}I don't have any powers.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,480
{\an5}I can't leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,920
{\an5}But I have dedicated my life
to fighting on the side of humanity,

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
{\an5}and to be recognized for that
is more than I can put into words.

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
{\an5}So, I will just say...

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,120
{\an5}I stand with mankind.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm gonna throw up.

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
{\an5}Are you still feeling weird?

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
{\an5}We should get you to the med bay.
You did not seem okay this morning.

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,680
{\an5}No, no, I'm fine.
I'm just disoriented.

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,920
{\an5}The world is...

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,880
{\an5}What was Lex doing up there?

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,560
{\an5}Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,120
{\an5}He doesn't usually accept them
in person,

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
{\an5}but this one meant a lot to him.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
People think he's a good guy?

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,840
{\an5}Kara, we're talking about Lex Luthor.

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
He's the best guy.

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,960
No, he's not.
He's a psychopathic lunatic!

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
{\an5}What? No, he...

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
{\an5}He's the boss.

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,960
And he's your number-one supporter.

82
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
I mean, besides Lena.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,000
{\an5}And all the times
they defended you to the President...

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
What has gotten into you?

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,600
{\an5}Hang on. Wait, wait,
did you just say "boss"?

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
No.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
{\an5}Oh, no, no, no, no.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,720
Alex, are we...

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Supergirl.

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,120
{\an5}- J'onn?
- I know you must be confused.

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,480
I was too.

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
{\an5}But it happened.

93
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,760
{\an5}It all happened.

94
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,600
Why are we the only two
that remember?

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
What are we that they are not?

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
Paragons.

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,800
We helped Oliver
restart the universe.

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
And this...

99
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
is the result.

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,800
{\an5}I suspect there
will be more such changes

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,520
{\an5}that are yet to reveal themselves.

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,400
{\an5}There's something
happening downtown.

103
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
{\an5}- I'll send a team.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
{\an5}I need to punch something.

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Hey!

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
{\an5}Look who came to join the fun.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm sorry, who are you?

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Weather Witch.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,440
And you are no match for my wrath.

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm having...

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
{\an5}Not so great a day,
which is actually your bad luck.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
{\an5}Sorry, she's one of mine.

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
{\an5}Well, what's she doing on my Earth?

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
What?

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,720
{\an5}Wait, wait, what are you doing
on my Earth?

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,080
{\an5}What, your Earth? This is my Earth.

117
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,600
- I thought...
- I thought...

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,480
Supergirl? Flash?

119
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,080
{\an5}I just love it when you guys team up.

120
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
{\an5}Would you sign this for me, please?

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,480
{\an5}Okay. Oh. Sure...

122
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,280
{\an5}Wait, you know both of us?

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
{\an5}And it's normal to see us together?

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,920
{\an5}Well, normally you'd also have
Green Arrow and a Legend or two.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,840
{\an5}Last year, even Batwoman joined in.

126
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,280
{\an5}Make that out to Marv. M-A- R-V.

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
- "Marv. M-A-R-V."
- Thank you.

128
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,160
{\an5}You're welcome.
Marv, as far as you know,

129
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,720
{\an5}how long have Supergirl
and I and all the rest of us

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,120
been working...

131
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,960
{\an5}Together, on this Earth?

132
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
Since forever.

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
What the heck?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Call for help.

135
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Now!

136
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,720
How did I get back here?

137
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
Ray, where are you?

138
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
Hey, Cap. Over here.

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,080
Ray!

140
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,560
Hey, hey.

141
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,760
Hey, are you okay?

142
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
Not that I'm ever one
to question a hug.

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,560
Ray, what was the last thing
that you remember?

144
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Portaling to this location
on your orders.

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
You don't remember
coming here for trivia night,

146
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
and being teleported
to an alternate Waverider

147
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,920
to stop the multiverse
from being destroyed?

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
Wait, was there a crossover?

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,480
Were we invited? Did we win?

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
That's certainly how it looks.

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
Did you just hear...

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
It's good to see you both safe.

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
J'onn, that's a neat trick.

154
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,960
Wait, you know J'onn J'onzz
from Supergirl's Earth?

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,560
Of course I know J'onn.
Wait, go back.

156
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Supergirl has her own Earth?

157
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200
Not any more.

158
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,200
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined,

159
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,640
and only we Paragons
know it was ever any different.

160
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
Okay, sorry, guys.
I'm a little lost here.

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,520
Here, this will be faster.

162
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
There was a multiverse?

163
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
It all got destroyed,
there's an evil Batman,

164
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,200
and there's a me that's a super-me?

165
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,080
It'll take him some time
to assimilate to this new paradigm.

166
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,920
I have been going from city to city,

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,360
restoring the memories
of our compatriots as best I can.

168
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
And what about Oliver?

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,640
There's been no sign of him.

170
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,040
Hey, where you going?

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
To find my friend.

172
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,960
Oliver!

173
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Oliver!

174
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Sara.

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
No, I need to talk to you guys.

176
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
We already know.

177
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
We already know.

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,280
Martian J'onn came by
and gave us a splitting headache.

179
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
It all happened, didn't it?

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
He died twice, Sara.

181
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,040
I wasn't there.

183
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Both times.

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Both times, I failed him.

185
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,440
- Digg...
- I'm so sorry.

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
It's okay.

187
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I wasn't there.

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
He was my brother.

189
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I know.

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Listen to me.

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
Look, we all...

192
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
We all died.

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,360
The entire universe, the multiverse.

194
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
Now we're back.

195
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,040
That means Oliver,
he might be back too.

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,760
After the brain dump...

197
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,800
we had Felicity run a global search.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people.

199
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
But they've got to be here
to be found.

200
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,800
You don't know, look...

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,200
When Oliver died,
he became something else.

202
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,680
He called it "the Spectre."

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,360
And maybe Felicity,
she just can't find him in that form.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,600
Digg, she just can't find him
in this form.

205
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Sara.

206
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
Sara, gone is gone.

207
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
He's gone.

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
J'onn.

209
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
Not any more.

211
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
No thanks to him.

212
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Do you know why he's like this?

213
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
And now, so do you.

214
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Oliver!

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
This is all his fault.

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,760
He's the one
who released the Anti-Monitor.

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,720
He paid dearly for his misjudgment,
but not as much as some others.

218
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,040
What happened?

219
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,840
Where am I? How did I get here?

220
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,360
You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

221
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,760
Well, that's an introduction.

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
Who the hell are you,
and what are you talking about?

223
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,800
You need to stay calm.
Your system's still recovering.

224
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
You, you need to calm down.

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm not going to stay here

226
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
and get lectured
by some government suit...

227
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
God!

228
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm so sorry.

230
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,920
And so you should be.

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,440
This is all your fault.

232
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,640
It is my fault.

233
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
But you, you solved it.

234
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,280
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

235
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
You fixed my mistake.

236
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Right?

237
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,520
Not entirely.

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
It's true.

239
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,680
We all live on the same Earth now.

240
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,160
Our Earths must have merged when
we helped Oliver reboot the universe.

241
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
I can't believe it.

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
- What are you guys doing here?
- I had to see if it was true.

243
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,720
The DEO, CatCo, all of National City
is on this Earth now.

244
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
Even Argo's up there.

245
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
We did it!

246
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
We saved everyone.

247
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,600
Not everyone.

248
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Oliver...

249
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
He didn't make it.

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
Guess we just have to face facts.

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
No, that's not, that's...

252
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start, but not himself?

253
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
Maybe this was the only way, Kara.

254
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,040
Maybe his sacrifice
made all of this possible.

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Him for us.

256
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,720
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

257
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
By who?

258
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,400
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

259
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,040
Beebo hungry.

260
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,840
How the hell did Beebo get here?

261
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Isn't the more pressing question,

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

263
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,760
This wouldn't be the first time.

264
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,960
- It's a long story.
- That's right.

265
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,320
Wally told us about the time
you guys used those totems

266
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
to turn yourselves into a giant Beebo
to find a time demon.

267
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
I guess it's not a long story.

268
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Could that be what's happening here?

269
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,440
Ava, Nate, you there?
I need a 20 on Behrad and his totem.

270
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,040
Sara, are you okay?

271
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Ray called us to tell us
you were on some special mission.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
But he was a little flimsy
with the deets,

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,640
so what's the happs, Caps?

274
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,040
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multiverse.

275
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,320
You got shanghaied into another
crossover, didn't you?

276
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Yeah, kind of.

277
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Did they kidnap you?

278
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
This is a classic crossover move.

279
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
We tell them we're too busy,
they commit a felony.

280
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

281
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,560
- Does Behrad have his totem?
<i>- Beebo?</i>

282
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,720
That doesn't make any sense.

283
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
You would need all six totems
to make that happen,

284
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
and Behrad's
definitely still on the ship.

285
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
All right, I gotta go.

286
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
- Wait, do you need help?
- No, stay in DC.

287
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
I don't want any more of my people
getting roped into this mess.

288
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Well, here's the thing...

289
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,280
One of us is kind of already there.

290
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Who?

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
And who should I make this out to?

292
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,800
Doris. I'm such a huge fan,
Rebecca...

293
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,680
I mean, what should I call you?

294
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
"Rebecca" is fine.

295
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,320
"To Doris.

296
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,120
"Thanks for the passion, love..."

297
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,280
- What is that?
- Why are they running?

298
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,840
Furball.

299
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Oh, my!

300
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,080
Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

301
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,640
He's gonna be so jealous.

302
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
Here he comes.

303
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
What's the plan?

304
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,000
Smile, Beebo.

305
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
What are you...

306
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm sorry, you guys
don't want to be in it?

307
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, bad timing.

308
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
Is this seriously happening
right now?

309
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
Maybe it's a good thing.

310
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Guess we could all use a distraction.

311
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,320
Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work. Good idea.

312
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,920
Guys, Beebo's still on the warpath.

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,760
Any suggestions on how
we take him down?

314
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,840
- What is that?
- It's a utility truck. Why?

315
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,600
You guys ready to do
a tag-team trip up?

316
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,800
Yeah, what do you have in mind?

317
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,160
All right, Supergirl, Atom,
keep him contained.

318
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
Flash, use those cables to your left.

319
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,960
- All right. Can do.
- Got it.

320
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Beebo want cuddles.

321
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Is this actually happening?

322
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,760
Is this what all the crossovers
are like?

323
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,080
Yes, and not exactly.

324
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

325
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,960
- Done.
- All right, now get him moving.

326
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
- Die, furball!
- Mick?

327
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,040
That blue bastard ruined
my book signing.

328
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,560
<i>Okay, everybody get ready to pull.</i>

329
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,880
Take it, take it.

330
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
All right.

331
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
The bigger they are...

332
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,120
The harder they fall.

333
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Thanks, Supergirl.

334
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,880
What the heck?

335
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,280
Guys, something's off.

336
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm not reading any known elements.
Nothing off the periodic table.

337
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,840
I don't think the rules apply
to a 50-foot talking plush toy.

338
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
Hey! Hey, Kate's here too. That's...

339
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,640
Sorry, what were you saying?

340
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,160
- It's unnatural.
- Alien?

341
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,560
- Hey!
- Or magic?

342
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,200
Sara, don't you and the Legends deal
with that kind of stuff all the time?

343
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,080
Or maybe it's just here
to keep us talking.

344
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,000
A diversion.

345
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,560
But for what?

346
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,760
I know what I'd do.

347
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,440
It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

348
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
to claim his reward...

349
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,040
Oh, and buy
that beautiful time-share in Bogota.

350
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,360
Come on, man. Beebo?

351
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,560
Is nothing sacred?

352
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, it's a smart move.

353
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,240
Distracting all the fuzz
with giant fuzz,

354
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,560
but someone should have told you...

355
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Beebo? He's off-limits.

356
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,000
Beebo.

357
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
Got him again.

358
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Pugh.

359
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,840
So, how normal was that for everyone?

360
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
And don't say "very."

361
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh, well, with this new Earth,
it just may be.

362
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,040
Dear God, I hope not.

363
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,560
What is that?

364
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Alcohol.

365
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
Rory, huh?

366
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,040
We had a Rory once on our team.

367
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
We did.

368
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
What's this?

369
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,600
Was there a memo that went out

370
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,240
on how to infiltrate
our secret bunker?

371
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,520
Why are you here?

372
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm here to warn you.
You see this?

373
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,600
This gauntlet is primed
to detect anti-matter,

374
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,320
of which there has been
a massive surge

375
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,960
here in the Star City area.

376
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Okay, well,
you're about two hours too late.

377
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,480
- Already took care of it.
- Did you? Really?

378
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,000
My readings say different.

379
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
This thing ain't over.

380
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
As a matter of fact...

381
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
It's just beginning.

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
Something's not right.

383
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,440
Is that thing still working?

384
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,400
Yeah, it's working.
I built it myself. It's infallible.

385
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of anti-matter.

386
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Then our fight isn't done, is it?

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,000
No. Or worse...

388
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,240
it's starting up all over again.

389
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Hey.

390
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,160
How'd you find me?

391
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,800
You feel that gust of wind
a few seconds ago?

392
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,560
That was me. I did a quick search
of the whole city for you.

393
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
When you didn't come back
for the post-Beebo celebration,

394
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I got a little worried.

395
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Yeah.

396
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
You see that tree over there?

397
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,680
My sister and I used to race
to the top when we were little.

398
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
I'd win every time.

399
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,560
I used to think it was
'cause I was a better climber, but...

400
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
Now I think Laurel let me win.

401
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,240
She knew I was a sore loser.

402
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
A lot has changed since then.

403
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,040
I was an assassin.

404
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,120
I was dead.

405
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,760
Now I'm the captain
of a freaking Timeship.

406
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,560
One thing remains the same...

407
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm still a sore loser.

408
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I know it's...

409
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,800
It's hard,
not having Oliver here with us.

410
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,800
But look at what his sacrifice
made possible.

411
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
Our world is...

412
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
It's different.

413
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,680
But at least it's safe.

414
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Yeah.

415
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
He was just the last tether...

416
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,360
To my old life, you know?

417
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,600
And he was the only person left
who knew me when I was just...

418
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Me.

419
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
With him gone,

420
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,200
my connection to this world,
this place...

421
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
To that tree...

422
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
It's gone.

423
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,640
I know what it's like to lose family.

424
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
My mom, my dad.

425
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Each death felt like...

426
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
There was no moving forward.

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,200
Like, life would never be the same.

428
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Yeah.

429
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,760
And I was right.
It's not the same, but...

430
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,120
Somehow it's okay.

431
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
Family isn't just the people
that you grew up with,

432
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,160
it's the people you find, the...

433
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,400
the ones you love,
the ones who make you crazy...

434
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Make you smile.

435
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,040
When did you get so wise?

436
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,200
The Legends, they are my family.

437
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,600
They have been for a while.

438
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,600
I guess I just...

439
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
I always thought
there would be at least someone

440
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
who remembered what I was like
before I got on that boat.

441
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
I thought we got rid
of all those things.

442
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,120
<i>Barry, Sara,
the Shadow Demons are back.</i>

443
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,600
<i>I believe we are being hunted.</i>

444
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
If they're hunting the Paragons,
that means...

445
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Ryan.

446
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Sara?

447
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,920
What the hell's going on?

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
You have to come with me. Now.

449
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,120
All right, Barry, John, Supergirl
and Batlady are gathering the troops.

450
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,160
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

451
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,720
Assassins sent to pick us off
in pairs.

452
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,480
How are the Shadow Demons
even still here?

453
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,600
Didn't Oliver destroy the guy
who controls them?

454
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,120
Well, not according to the surge
in anti-matter energy I'm reading.

455
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

456
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,640
But you said
Oliver sacrificed himself...

457
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,920
To create this new world.

458
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,520
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

459
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,440
Well, then how do we do that?

460
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,680
Well, let's just throw him
into the sun

461
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,560
and let the bastard burn.

462
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,920
Oh, yeah, let's throw him in the sun,

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,240
and cause an anti-matter explosion
that obliterates the solar system.

464
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,520
You know what? Let's not do that.

465
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,560
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

466
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
instead of being
the cause of the problem.

467
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,160
That's the solution,
blow up the solar system?

468
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Okay. Guys, guys,
we're all on the same team, okay?

469
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
No, Scrappy's right.

470
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
It's my fault we're in this mess.
We gotta fix it.

471
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,280
- Gotta fix it!
- It's just a little tricky.

472
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,480
The Anti-Monitor
is made of anti-matter,

473
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,520
and like its opposite, it can neither
be created nor destroyed.

474
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,840
- It can only...
- Change form

475
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
and move from place to place.

476
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
So what if we do just that?

477
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
What if we could set off
a chain reaction

478
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,720
that will destabilize his form,
compressing his molecules

479
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
so he's essentially
shrinking for eternity?

480
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,480
Is that kind of reaction
even possible?

481
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Sure it is.
I did it a bunch of times by accident

482
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
when I was developing
my A.T.O.M. Exosuit.

483
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,160
So you think you can keep him
shrinking indefinitely?

484
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,080
Essentially we'd be sending him
to the "Atomverse."

485
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,600
I like to call it the "Microverse."

486
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,320
That's better.

487
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,000
Possible trademark issues,
but that's better.

488
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
He could get stuck there
for, like, ever.

489
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,440
In theory, it could totally work.

490
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,360
But developing a device in time...

491
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,120
Leave that to me, dear leaguers.
Gotta get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

492
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Scrappy.

493
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,960
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did on Earth-38,

494
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,160
then things are gonna get messy.

495
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Geek team, get on it.

496
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,360
Mick, go with them. Keep them safe.

497
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,040
The rest of us,

498
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
we'll need to hold back
this incoming army.

499
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,080
This can work, Sara.

500
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I, I know it can.

501
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,560
That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

502
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
Here we are, back at square one.

503
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,360
This new Earth isn't square one.

504
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,720
It's what Oliver gave up his life
to create.

505
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,600
We have to protect it.

506
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,800
If we're gonna go down...

507
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
We go down fighting.

508
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,080
All right, listen up!

509
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,720
I got a ton of those Shadow things
descending on Gardener Pier.

510
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
<i>Copy. We're en route.</i>

511
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,040
This is new.

512
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,680
New world, new look.

513
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,080
Cut the chatter, they're here.

514
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
What the hell?

515
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Was that it?

516
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,520
It's not over yet.

517
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,440
Paragons.

518
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,440
The universal safeguard
meant to thwart me.

519
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
It is time to meet your end.

520
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
We'll need a reinforced core
to contain the reaction.

521
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
- Titanium?
- No, that's too heavy.

522
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,240
What we need, what we need is...

523
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,840
Depleted promethium.

524
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,280
S.T.A.R. Labs, I've got Shadows
advancing on your position.

525
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
<i>On it.</i>

526
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
It's been a while, Frosty.

527
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,560
- You look good.
- Thanks.

528
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,240
I read your book, "Rebecca."

529
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Which one? I'm very prolific.

530
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you wanna take this guy
or should I?

531
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,320
Ladies first.

532
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,480
Age before beauty.

533
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,400
Who the hell are you?

534
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,200
The guy who just saved your ass.

535
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,360
We had that covered.

536
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Sure you did.

537
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,920
Company's coming. You ready?

538
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,080
I stay ready.

539
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,120
I am destiny incarnate.

540
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,880
Inexorable and inescapable.

541
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,400
You are nothing.

542
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,440
Insects...

543
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,360
fated to be crushed beneath my heel
without a moment's thought.

544
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,800
Fighting is useless.

545
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080
Surrender.

546
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
Not today.

547
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Not ever.

548
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,240
Oliver died so that
we could continue to fight.

549
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,440
He sacrificed everything
for this new world,

550
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,440
and we will not fail him.

551
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,000
We will not fail this world.

552
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
For Oliver!

553
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
For Oliver.

554
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
For Oliver.

555
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,720
- For Oliver!
- For Oliver!

556
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,480
The age of heroes ends now.

557
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,280
Guys, we're gonna need a bigger bomb.

558
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,360
Sky team, you're with me.

559
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,400
Ray, how's that shrink bomb coming?

560
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,040
Well, we could really use
some fast hands.

561
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Could we ever.

562
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Barry?

563
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,800
Supergirl, look out!

564
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
J'onn!

565
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,640
Where are you from, Sparkles?

566
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,040
Don't call me "Sparkles."

567
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,280
I'm from Freeland.

568
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Martian came, got in my head,
told me y'all were caught up.

569
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
It's been a weird day.

570
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,360
That's an understatement.

571
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
- All right, what are we making?
- Hey.

572
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
- All right, so, plans...
- Yup.

573
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040
Right? Now, this is
what we have to build.

574
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Now, these pieces
are all very volatile.

575
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
We need to, yeah, you...

576
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
- How's this look?
- Okay, that's good.

577
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I love when he does that.

578
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
It's perfect, actually.
Okay, so, now, all we have to do

579
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,120
is get it into direct contact
with the Anti-Monitor

580
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
once we've activated it.

581
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,440
Okay, to activate it,
I just press this...

582
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,640
- No, no, don't!
- You're crazy!

583
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Okay, relax! Relax.

584
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,760
- Okay, Ray, you're coming with me.
- Oh, cool.

585
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
No!

586
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,560
Shadows are on the move again.
Perez Landing.

587
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,800
Yeah, we know. We're here.

588
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Barry!

589
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,960
Bomb's ready.
Ray's running it to the sky team.

590
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,560
We're running out of time here, Ray.

591
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,960
- Hurry!
- Hurrying.

592
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,880
Hope I'm not too late.

593
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,360
- Ray?
- Hang on, Superman.

594
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,000
Throw it like a girl.

595
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,320
Always.

596
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,720
No!

597
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,520
We did it. We did it!

598
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,040
Wait, but, where is Kal?

599
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,240
I'm right here.

600
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
Sorry about that, Superman.

601
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Here you go.

602
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,520
Thank you, Ollie.

603
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,840
My fellow Americans,
today, our way of life, our world...

604
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,240
Almost came to an end.

605
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,600
{\an5}<i>An entity known
as the Anti-Monitor attacked Earth,</i>

606
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480
<i>intent on its destruction.</i>

607
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,320
<i>Thankfully, we were saved
by Earth's greatest heroes,</i>

608
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,840
<i>who came together...</i>

609
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,000
Sara.

610
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Hey, sweetie.

611
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,880
Baby, come over here,
your brother wants to play with you.

612
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,000
<i>Their unity and strength
should be an example for us all.</i>

613
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,240
<i>I'm told this assembly
was led by Star City's Oliver Queen,</i>

614
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,640
<i>otherwise known as the Green Arrow.</i>

615
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,160
<i>We give thanks
to these brave women and men</i>

616
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,640
<i>who, with great tenacity, tireless
work and the utmost courage</i>

617
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,920
<i>put their lives on the line
for our country, our planet.</i>

618
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,360
Hey, Lois.

619
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,840
Clark, I need you to get
to Metropolis now, it's the boys.

620
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,520
The boys?

621
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,920
Yeah, honey, your sons.

622
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,480
<i>While in a hard-fought battle
loss is expected,</i>

623
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,480
<i>it never gets any easier.</i>

624
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,720
<i>So, it is with great sadness
that I must inform you</i>

625
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,080
<i>that Oliver Queen sacrificed his life
for our world's survival.</i>

626
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,320
<i>He is known to us
as the first of our heroes.</i>

627
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,960
<i>And while this is a devastating loss,</i>

628
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,680
<i>we can take solace in knowing
that he lived as he died...</i>

629
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,640
{\an5}<i>with honor.</i>

630
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,360
<i>I ask all of you,</i>

631
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,080
<i>to join me in a moment of silence
to honor him now.</i>

632
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,440
A grateful nation thanks you,
Mr. Queen.

633
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,600
May you finally find rest
in the hereafter.

634
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,760
{\an5}<i>God bless you...</i>

635
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,480
{\an5}<i>and God bless
the United States of America.</i>

636
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
{\an5}<i>Good night.</i>

637
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,440
<i>In the end, there was only one.</i>

638
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,200
<i>A single black infinitude.</i>

639
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,520
<i>Then the infinitude found release.</i>

640
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,960
<i>And finally, the darkness broke,
filling it with life...</i>

641
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,200
<i>With the multiverse.</i>

642
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,520
<i>Every existence,
multiplied by possibility...</i>

643
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,520
<i>and spread out before space
and time in infinite measure.</i>

644
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,440
<i>Civilizations rose and fell...</i>

645
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,280
<i>And rose again,
across reality's grasping expanse.</i>

646
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,920
<i>Life, a precious gift,</i>

647
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,680
<i>persevering in the face
of every obstacle.</i>

648
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,640
<i>Until, finally...</i>

649
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,240
<i>the age of heroes was born.</i>

650
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,080
Thanks for saving us, Oliver.

651
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,720
The world has hope again.

652
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,920
I have hope again.

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,120
I'll never forget you.

654
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,920
Thanks for believing in me,
even when I didn't.

655
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,960
You had this way of...

656
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,800
bringing out the very best
in all of us.

657
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm gonna miss you, man.

658
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,480
I've lost a lot of people
that I love,

659
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,680
and I never imagined my life
without you in it.

660
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,200
You were always there for me.

661
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
And now...

662
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Ollie, you changed my fate...

663
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
for the better.

664
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Thank you.

665
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
I never met Oliver, but...

666
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,280
he must have been a good dude.

667
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
But why'd you choose
a condemned building?

668
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,320
What?

669
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
No. This is not a condemned building.

670
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,000
No, listen, this is an old

671
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,480
S.T.A.R. Labs research facility
that nobody uses.

672
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,600
And what's even better,
no one knows it exists.

673
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
- Good for you.
- No, good for us.

674
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,320
I figure we could all use this
to gather if...

675
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
anything ever happens again.

676
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,920
- It's a great idea, Barry.
- Thanks, Superman.

677
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,760
It's a better option
than you all dropping by the DEO.

678
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,200
Why do we even need it?

679
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,840
I mean, how often does the world
almost come to an end?

680
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Oh, it's like that?

681
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,360
Don't worry,
I was the new kid last year.

682
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,560
All right, listen, I haven't even
showed you guys the best part yet.

683
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Ready?

684
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,600
Oh, nice!

685
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,040
- You should have led with that, bro.
- Yeah.

686
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,240
- Not bad.
- I love it!

687
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,640
It's perfect.

688
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,120
Sounds like
we need to call Pest Control.

689
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
What was that?
