What's with the stupid mask?

473
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,871
I like you.
You remind me of my sister in Kiev.

474
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,540
Dmitry is an initiate.

475
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,052
The mask ensures his silence
until he proves himself

476
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,587
and becomes a full member.

477

Of what? Who are you?

478
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,015
We are called "the Whisper Gang."
Gotham's most notorious smugglers.

479
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,060
We used to number in the hundreds
until the Court saw our growing strength

480
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,102
and they offered us a partnership,

481
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,652
only to betray us.

482
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,902
Many escaped back to Ukraine,
but a few of us stayed back,

483
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,908
hoping to find a way to enact revenge.

484
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,454
- And we did.
- The key?

485
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,457
But what does it open?

486
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,622
A safe.

487
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,795
It is in
one of the Court's buildings, here.

488
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:52,554
Inside, there is a device
that we believe can destroy them.

489
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,931
What? Like some kind of weapon?

490
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,844
Oh, honestly, we don't know.

491
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,102
We captured a member.

492
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,355
But even he didn't know
what's inside the safe.

493
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:05,810
Only that the Court fears it
falling into the hands of their enemies.

494
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,399
Wait, wouldn't they know you stole it?

495
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,522
They're probably waiting for you
to show up there.

496
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,526
No. Because, originally,
the safe had two keys.

497
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,242
The Court still has one of them.
And the second one was thought lost.

498
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,369
Until we found it.

499
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,452
You mean, we did?

500
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,247
The Court of Owls killed my parents.

501
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,629
I stood down because I thought
there was no way to defeat them.

What are you proposing?

503
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:37,095
If what you're saying is true,
and there is something in that safe,

504
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,640
then that's no longer the case.
