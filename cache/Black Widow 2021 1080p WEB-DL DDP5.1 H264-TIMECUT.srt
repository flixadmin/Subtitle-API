1
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,610
Hey, Nat!

2
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,680
We're both upside down.

3
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,930
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

4
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,640
No, you will.

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,440
You can't hold it much longer.

6
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,860
Told you you'd fall down first.

7
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,320
I told you! I told you!

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,950
Told you so!

9
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,410
Mommy!

10
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,510
What happened?

11
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
She fell on her knee.

12
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,550
-Oh, you bump your knee?
-Mmm-hmm.

13
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh...

14
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,940
Oh, come on, little one.

15
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,730
Get up. You're okay.

16
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,900
Come on. You're a brave girl.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,610
Your pain only makes you stronger.

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,200
-Right, you?
-Yeah.

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
-Yeah?
-Look!

20
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,490
Forest stars.

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
Yeah. You know what?

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,580
Those are actually part of the Lampyridae family.

23
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,290
And the glow, the glow that you see,

24
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,920
that comes from a chemical reaction called...

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,630
bioluminescence.

26
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,720
Come on, time for dinner.

27
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,090
Bio-goomin-feasants?

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,640
"Bio-goomin-feasants." That's right.

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,520
Dinner!

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,850
Come on, dinner, big girl!

31
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,900
I want mac and cheese.

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,690
Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

33
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,780
caviar and champagne.

34
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,780
Grab the napkins.

35
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,320
You take this. Thank you.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh, would you grab the ranch dressing for Dad?

37
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,710
Okay.

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,630
Green beans are my favorite vegetable.

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,670
Dad's home!

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,970
Hey, Dad.

41
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,550
Hey, baby.

42
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,650
Everything okay?

43
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,900
How was everybody's day?

44
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,070
Mommy taught me about lamp bugs.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,070
And I fell and hurt my knee,

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,790
-but it doesn't hurt anymore.
-Mmm-hmm.

47
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,950
And we also saw fireflies in the backyard.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
That was my favorite part

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,250
-of the whole day.
-No.

50
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,710
Yelena, we see fireflies every year.

51
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,790
How long do we have?

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,460
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

53
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,010
I don't wanna go.

54
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't say that.

55
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,390
Girls...

56
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,020
you remember when I told you that one day we would have that big adventure?

57
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,900
-Today's the day.
-Yay!

58
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,870
All right, let's go.

59
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,630
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,760
-Come on, we gotta hurry.
-Thank you.

61
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,010
-I don't have my shoes.
-Thank you, baby.

62
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,800
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,220
-But I'm still hungry.
-Yeah? Guess what?

64
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,770
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

65
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,780
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

66
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
-You have it?
-Yeah.

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,830
-It's the only copy?
-It's the only one not on fire.

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,300
Where are we going?

69
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Home.

70
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,720
Mommy, you're silly.

71
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,470
We just left home.

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,650
I want my song.

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,290
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

75
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,840
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,260
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die"

77
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,590
"This'll be the day that I die"

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

79
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,250
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

80
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,880
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

81
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Come on. Honey, honey.

82
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,270
-Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
-Okay.

83
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,810
-Nat, hurry up!
-I'm coming!

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,060
Okay. Seat belts.

85
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,990
Okay.

86
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,070
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

87
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,530
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

88
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,530
Mom?

89
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,790
Mom!

90
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,800
I need you up here.

91
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,260
-Okay.
-Okay.

92
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,300
I need you to pull right.

93
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,060
Mom, you've got blood on you.

94
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,230
It's okay, baby.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,950
Hit the accelerator there.

96
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,170
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

97
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,800
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

98
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Let's count together.

99
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,930
45, 50...

100
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,740
Pull back.
You can do it!

101
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,950
Pull back.
All your strength.

102
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,870
Okay.

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,130
Get up, Mommy.

104
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,510
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

105
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,730
The Red Guardian returns.

106
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,360
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

107
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,570
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

108
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,780
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

109
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,950
I wanna get back in it.

110
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,490
General Dreykov, it's been over three years.

111
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,910
Never let them take your heart.

112
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,630
Did you get it?

113
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,590
And the North Institute?

114
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Ashes.

115
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,760
It's gonna be okay.

116
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,970
How is Melina?

117
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,430
She'll live. She's strong.

118
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,770
-Mommy?
-Mom?

119
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,900
-Daddy!
-I'll handle this.

120
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,690
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Yelena!

121
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,400
-Daddy!
-Get away from her!

122
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,240
Don't touch her!

123
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,280
Don't touch her!

124
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,950
I will kill you all!

125
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,620
Honey.

126
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,710
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

127
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,050
I don't wanna go back there.

128
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,300
I wanna stay in Ohio.

129
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,060
You can't take her.

130
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,190
You can't.

131
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,980
She's only six.

132
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,190
You were even younger.

133
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,020
It's okay.

134
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,940
Come here.

135
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
You're gonna be all right.

136
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,370
Do you know why it's gonna be all right?

137
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,040
'Cause my girls are the toughest girls in the world.

138
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,250
You're gonna take care of each other, okay?

139
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,090
And everything, everything's gonna be fine.

140
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,360
That one, she has fire in her.

141
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,030
What was her name?

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,450
Natasha.

143
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,410
Ah... Natasha.

144
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,150
No!

145
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Remove all the defects.

146
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,250
That one

147
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,000
and her.

148
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,590
No!

149
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,760
Yelena!

150
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,100
Take it! Take it! No!

151
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,650
No!

152
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,200
The Red Room is your home now.

153
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,620
Get off me! No!

154
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,890
Undercover spies in our communities.

155
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,730
They took on false identities, even raised families...

156
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,470
-They're topside, sir!
-Tier 1 has LOS!

157
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,310
We've got all exits covered.

158
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,480
All right. Stay alert.

159
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,310
I'm sending in alpha squad.

160
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,620
Natasha Romanoff is in violation of the Sokovia Accords.

161
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,700
She assaulted the king of Wakanda.

162
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,160
Make an example out of her.

163
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,170
-Yeah?
-Don't do this.

164
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,550
Do what?

165
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,550
Come after me.

166
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,760
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

167
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,720
Thought maybe you'd be calling me to cut a deal.

168
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,560
'Cause from my vantage point,

169
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,010
it's the federal fugitive

170
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,270
who's desperate.

171
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,390
From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.

172
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,350
What is this, your second triple bypass?

173
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,730
I wouldn't worry about me.

174
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,150
We got Barton, we got Wilson and that other guy,

175
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,110
the incredible shrinking convict.

176
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,990
Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.

177
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,620
Where you gonna go?

178
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,120
I've lived a lot of lives before I met you, Ross.

179
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,870
You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. I'm done.

180
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,540
Romanoff?

181
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,530
Got an empty nest, Secretary Ross.

182
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,650
Her tracker, sir.

183
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,380
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

184
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,890
I have sights on collateral one.

185
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,350
Firing in place of three.

186
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,150
Five, four...

187
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,230
She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

188
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,940
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

189
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,270
Oksana.

190
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,730
Oh, no.

191
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,690
What did I do?

192
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,650
Free the others.

193
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,250
Yelena, we need a status report.

194
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,630
Yelena, we need a status report.

195
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,800
Converge on team leader.

196
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,060
General Dreykov, we have a deserter.

197
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,650
Permission to activate Taskmaster Protocol?

198
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,970
Smile.

199
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,670
You're in my bed.

200
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,790
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

201
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,090
Did you get everything on my list?

202
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,470
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

203
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,050
Mix and match, you should be able
to stretch it to 20 or so identities.

204
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,850
Fanny Longbottom?

205
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,810
-What?
-What, are you 12?

206
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,020
We've got a generator outside.

207
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,150
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

208
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,990
but, you know, I've got a guy coming for that.

209
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,070
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

210
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,280
I've got your basic hardware kit stashed under the stairs.

211
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,950
Nice.

212
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,870
Are you okay?

213
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Why wouldn't I be?

214
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,250
I hear things. You know, something about
the Avengers getting divorced...

215
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,540
Ugh. It's fine.

216
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,250
I'm actually better on my own.

217
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Are you sure?

218
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,170
Yeah.

219
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,880
Because you can tell me, you know.

220
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,720
That's the way the whole friends thing works.

221
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,720
I know. I have friends.

222
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,770
People who have friends don't call me.

223
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,900
And I don't pay you to worry.

224
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,330
Oh, hey.

225
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,630
What's all this junk?

226
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,880
Oh, just some mail and personals from the Budapest safe house.

227
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Budapest?

228
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,970
Yeah. Budapest.

229
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,300
-No, it's "Budapest."
-Budapest.

230
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,550
Budapest.

231
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,810
-It's "Budapest."
-Whatever.

232
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,190
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

233
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,650
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

234
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,940
Well, if you don't want it, throw it in the rubbish.

235
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,470
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

236
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,340
Why did you break up the encounter

237
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,510
with my pet python?

238
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,140
Because I discovered he had a crush on me.

239
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,600
Moonraker 1 on preset launch program...

240
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,770
Oh, great.

241
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,400
...minus two minutes.

242
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Retract crew access...

243
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,790
I'm pretty sure Ross has no jurisdiction here.

244
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,050
And you should know I'm a better shot when I'm pissed off.

245
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,860
You're not here for me.

246
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,310
Oh, shit.

247
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,490
I know you're out there.

248
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,290
I know you know I'm out here.

249
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,590
Then why are you skulking about like it's a minefield?

250
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,710
'Cause I don't know if I can trust you.

251
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Funny, I was going to say the same thing.

252
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,010
So, we gonna talk like grown-ups?

253
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,730
Is that what we are?

254
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,780
Put it down before I make you.

255
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,030
You put yours down.

256
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,370
Watch your step.

257
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,720
Stay down. Stay down.

258
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,310
Stay down.

259
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,190
You had to come to Budapest, didn't you?

260
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,480
I came here because I thought you wouldn't.

261
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,360
But since you're here, what bullet does that?

262
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,780
Not bullets. Arrows.

263
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,030
Ah, right.

264
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,370
If you didn't think I'd come here, why'd you send me this?

265
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,410
You brought it back here?

266
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,460
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

267
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,050
It's a synthetic gas.

268
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,590
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

269
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,470
The gas immunizes the brain's neuropathways

270
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,550
from external manipulation.

271
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,010
Maybe in English next time?

272
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,640
Why don't you take it to one of your super-scientist friends?

273
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,940
They can explain it to you.

274
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,600
Tony Stark, maybe?

275
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,270
Oh, yeah. We're not really talking right now, so...

276
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,400
Great. Perfect timing.

277
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,650
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

278
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
I don't wanna be here.

279
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

280
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,990
Well, what was I supposed to do?

281
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,080
You're the only superhero person that I know.

282
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,040
That was the whole reason I sent it to you.

283
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,590
I kept checking the news,

284
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,170
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

285
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
What?

286
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,890
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

287
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,640
It's been gone for years.

288
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,640
Dreykov's dead.

289
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,190
I killed him.

290
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,440
You don't actually believe that, do you?

291
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,160
You really do believe that.

292
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,740
Dreykov's dead.

293
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,160
It took almost destroying the entire city just to get to him.

294
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,910
If you're so sure, then tell me what happened.

295
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,700
Tell me exactly.

296
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,660
We rigged bombs.

297
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,330
-Who's "we"?
-Clint Barton.

298
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,540
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

299
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,090
Simple as that?

300
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,180
Yeah, sure, "simple."

301
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
That's what I'd call imploding a five-story building

302
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,930
and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces.

303
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,140
Took 10 days in hiding before
we could even get out of Budapest.

304
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,900
And you checked the body?

305
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,650
Confirmed the kill?

306
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,990
There was no body left to check.

307
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,780
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

308
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,720
Where are we trying to get?

309
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,890
Motorbike! East side of the building.

310
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,290
I got you!

311
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,010
No!

312
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,780
Hey.

313
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,990
Don't move. You're hurt.

314
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,360
Let me help you.

315
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,760
-What are you doing?
-He's making me.

316
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,630
Do you believe me now?

317
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,550
How many others?

318
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,090
Enough.

319
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,890
Which one's yours?

320
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,480
Black. Brown seat.

321
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,520
Where are my keys?

322
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,990
Any day now.

323
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,740
You can't just steal a guy's car.

324
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,740
So you want me to chase him down and un-steal it?

325
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,870
-Okay. Any time now, please.
-Shut up.

326
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,570
Okay, you got a plan,

327
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,200
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

328
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

329
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,200
That's a shit plan.

330
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,090
You're welcome.

331
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,650
Oh, shit. He's back.

332
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,290
Put your seat belt on.

333
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,660
You're such a mom.

334
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,110
Natasha, no.

335
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,320
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

336
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,290
No. Not now, trust me.

337
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
You okay?

338
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,720
Yeah. Great plan.

339
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,470
I love the part where I almost bled to death.

340
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,430
This is cozy.

341
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,190
Barton and I spent two days hiding out up here.

342
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,940
That must have been fun.

343
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,060
Who the hell is that guy?

344
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,610
Dreykov's special project.

345
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,150
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

346
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,450
It's like fighting a mirror.

347
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,280
Dreykov only deploys him for top-priority missions.

348
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,120
This doesn't make any sense.

349
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,750
Well, the truth rarely makes sense when you omit key details.

350
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,870
What is that supposed to mean?

351
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,000
You didn't say one word about Dreykov's daughter.

352
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,710
You killed her.

353
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,760
I had to.

354
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,720
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

355
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,550
We need confirmation Dreykov's in the building.

356
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,600
His car is pulling up now.

357
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,580
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

358
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,410
I needed her to be sure.

359
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,120
Natasha, we clear?

360
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,420
All clear.

361
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,050
And here you are, not so sure.

362
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,720
I needed out.

363
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,030
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

364
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I have no idea.

365
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,120
He moves location constantly.

366
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,750
And every widow is sedated on entry
and exit for maximum security.

367
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,460
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

368
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,170
Well, it's not smart to attack an
Avenger if you want to stay hidden.

369
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,510
I mean, the clue is in the name.

370
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,970
Dreykov kills you,

371
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,890
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

372
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,390
Wait, what are the big ones?

373
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,930
Well, I doubt the god from space has
to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

374
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,610
Where did you think I was all this time?

375
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,700
I thought that you got out and were living a normal life.

376
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,120
And you just never made contact again?

377
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,160
Honestly, I thought you didn't wanna see me.

378
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,870
Bullshit.

379
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,710
You just didn't want your baby sister to tag along,

380
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,580
whilst you saved the world with the cool kids.

381
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,710
You weren't really my sister.

382
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,590
And the Avengers aren't really your family.

383
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,140
-Why do you always do that thing?
-Do what?

384
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,760
The thing you do when you're fighting.

385
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,270
The... Like, the...

386
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,190
This thing that you do

387
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,400
when you whip your hair when you're fighting

388
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,020
with the arm and the hair.

389
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,530
And you do, like, a fighting pose.

390
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,030
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

391
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,110
I'm not a poser.

392
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,120
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

393
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,950
but it does look like you think everyone's looking at you, like,

394
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
all the time.

395
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,620
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

396
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,210
to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused.

397
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,750
Trying to be more than just a trained killer.

398
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,050
Well, then you were fooling yourself

399
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,560
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

400
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,930
Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine.

401
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,310
I'm not the killer that little girls call their hero.

402
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,830
That gas,

403
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,250
the counteragent,

404
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,170
it was synthesized in secret

405
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,010
by an older widow from Melina's generation.

406
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,550
I was on the mission to retrieve it, and she exposed me

407
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,550
and I killed the widow that freed me.

408
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,310
Did you have a choice?

409
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,270
What you experienced was psychological conditioning.

410
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,810
I'm talking about chemically altering brain functions.

411
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,190
They're two completely different things.

412
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,610
You're fully conscious, but you don't know which part is you.

413
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,410
I'm still not sure.

414
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,880
-Is that all there is left?
-Mmm-hmm.

415
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,050
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

416
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,130
He takes more every day.

417
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,100
Children who don't have anyone to protect them.

418
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,510
Just like us when we were small.

419
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,640
Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow.

420
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,190
The rest, he kills.

421
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,150
To him, we are just things.

422
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,570
Weapons with no face that he can just throw away.

423
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,490
Because there is always more.

424
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,330
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

425
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,120
Alexei?

426
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,330
"Dad."

427
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,930
Did you ever look for your parents?
Your real ones?

428
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,770
Well, my mom abandoned me in the street like garbage.

429
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,270
What about you?

430
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,940
They destroyed my birth certificate, so I reinvented it.

431
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,070
My parents still live in Ohio.

432
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,070
My sister moved out west.

433
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,160
Is that right?

434
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,870
You're a science teacher.

435
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,870
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

436
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,710
Your husband, he renovates houses.

437
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,170
That is not my story.

438
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,050
What is your story?

439
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,010
I never let myself be alone long enough to think about it.

440
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,940
Did you ever wish for kids?

441
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,270
I want a dog.

442
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,950
Where you gonna go?

443
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,700
I don't know.

444
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,460
I don't really have anywhere to go back to,

445
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,120
so I guess anywhere.

446
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,470
-Don't.
-Don't what?

447
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,090
You're going to give me some big hero speech,

448
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
I can feel it.

449
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,100
Speeches aren't really my thing.

450
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,180
Huh.

451
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,560
It was more like an invitation.

452
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,190
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

453
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:21,810
Yeah.

454
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,230
Even though the Red Room is impossible to find

455
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,360
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

456
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,570
Yeah.

457
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,570
That sounds like a shitload of work.

458
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,950
Could be fun, though.

459
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,370
Yup.

460
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,420
I saw where he put the keys.

461
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,010
Top drawer, green cabinet.

462
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,020
You know, this is the first piece of clothing

463
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,610
I've ever bought for myself.

464
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,990
That?

465
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,570
Yeah. You don't like it?

466
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,280
Is that like a...

467
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,370
Is it army surplus, or...

468
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,990
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

469
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,700
But I use them all the time,

470
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:20,080
and I made some of my own modifications.

471
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,870
Whatever.

472
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,250
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

473
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,710
I've never had control over my own life before, and now I do.

474
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,550
I want to do things.

475
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,510
Hmm...

476
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,970
I like your vest.

477
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,850
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

478
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,140
It's good. Yes. I like it.

479
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,680
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

480
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,820
I really don't know where the Red Room is, though.

481
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,980
-I'm sorry.
-I know.

482
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,990
But I think I know somebody who does.

483
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,160
Oh, yeah? Who?

484
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,490
We're gonna need a jet.

485
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,620
I said we needed a jet.

486
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,540
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

487
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,290
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

488
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,960
I thought you were supposed to be the best.

489
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
Like a real pro.

490
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,420
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

491
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,380
Was the free flat and lifetime supply of kissel

492
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,130
-not to your liking?
-Ha!

493
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,880
Don't let her wind you up.

494
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,470
No, I take exception to impugning my professionalism.

495
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,470
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

496
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,890
You, too, huh? Tag team.

497
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,150
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

498
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,770
Where's the rest?

499
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,610
Voilà.

500
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,450
Ooh.

501
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,160
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

502
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,500
How is it?

503
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,870
It's dry.
It's really dry.

504
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,010
You know, you're getting dangerously
close to running out your tab.

505
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,140
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

506
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,850
all my prices go up.

507
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,970
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,190
Your mate, Secretary Ross, has been sniffing around my affairs

509
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,310
to the point at which I've got contacts declining my calls.

510
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,400
I'm a private contractor.

511
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,400
You are sensitive.

512
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,110
You're a very annoying individual.

513
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,240
-I'll make it up to you.
-Mmm-hmm.

514
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,160
That's what you say every time.

515
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,630
So, I have the nuclear code.

516
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,260
But there he is.

517
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,970
-Captain America!
-America.

518
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,270
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

519
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,650
I grab hold of his shield

520
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,530
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

521
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,830
Oh... Oh, no.

522
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,700
Oh...

523
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,210
That guy think he going to beat me.

524
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,880
Anyway, this shield, you know, that he carries with him

525
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,840
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

526
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,170
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

527
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,420
and I push him out the window.

528
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,050
And I make my escape. Huh?

529
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,260
What year was this?

530
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,890
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

531
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,060
I know.

532
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,440
Captain America was still frozen in ice then.

533
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,780
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

534
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,790
Oh, no.

535
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,960
Uh-oh.

536
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,460
Aw, look at the big bear.

537
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,300
Gonna cry, little girl?

538
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,170
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

539
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,250
Move to the door on the south wall.

540
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
Go left.

541
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,820
Just don't make a scene.

542
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,260
You made a scene, didn't you?

543
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,890
What now?

544
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,900
We're gettin' you outta here.

545
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,130
Go to the upper level.

546
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,130
Move your ass, super soldier.

547
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,690
He's never going to make it.

548
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,270
Get me closer.

549
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,820
You got a better idea?

550
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,030
Natasha.

551
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,210
Such a poser.

552
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,280
Seriously?

553
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,860
Whoo!

554
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,740
Sorry!

555
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,120
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

556
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,950
Back up!

557
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,790
We're both doing a really good job.

558
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,930
No.

559
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,720
Okay. Enough of this.

560
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Ha!

561
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,250
Whoa...

562
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,420
This would be a cool way to die.

563
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,470
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

564
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,760
Move your ass!

565
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,830
Get us outta here!

566
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,630
Huh.

567
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,420
Wait!

568
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,120
Yes!

569
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,450
I need some help up here!

570
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,340
Oh, that was exciting.

571
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,560
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

572
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,140
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

573
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,310
Okay.

574
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:13,150
Wow.

575
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,200
Okay.

576
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,280
Why the aggression, huh?

577
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,540
Is it your time of the month?

578
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,120
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

579
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,500
Or ovaries.

580
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,960
Yeah. That's what happens when the Red Room

581
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,460
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

582
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:37,170
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

583
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,800
They just get right in there and they chop them all away.

584
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:43,810
-Everything out, so you can't have babies.
-Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

585
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,480
You don't have to get so clinical and nasty.

586
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,140
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

587
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,480
-fallopian tubes, but okay.
-No.

588
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:56,860
It means so much to me that you came back for me.

589
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,610
No. No. You're gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room.

590
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,280
Huh.

591
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,160
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

592
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,740
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

593
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,960
Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

594
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,250
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

595
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,380
'Cause they treated me like family.

596
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,380
Really? Family?

597
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,840
Well, where are they now?

598
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,680
Where is that family now?

599
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,850
Tell me where the Red Room is.

600
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,980
I have no idea.

601
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,230
Okay?

602
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,860
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

603
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,030
-Dreykov?
-Yeah.

604
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,530
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

605
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,030
Gives me glory...

606
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,200
Soviet Union's first and only super soldier.

607
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,540
I could have been more famous than Captain America.

608
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,130
Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission.

609
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,710
Three years!

610
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,840
So tedious, boring me to tears.

611
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,260
No offense, huh?

612
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,760
Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

613
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,310
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

614
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,140
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

615
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,900
Or maybe I don't like his hair or something

616
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,230
and I say something casually about that.

617
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Maybe, you know,

618
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,520
I want the Party to feel actually like a party

619
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:20,070
instead of this sourpuss organization.

620
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,400
But instead, no.

621
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:25,570
He puts me in prison for the rest of my life.

622
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,870
He just runs off and hides, huh?

623
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,790
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

624
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,790
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

625
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,920
Can we throw him out the window now?

626
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,010
I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude.

627
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,090
All right.

628
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:45,970
Wait, Mom Melina?

629
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,140
We thought she was dead.

630
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,020
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

631
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,350
-Ew.
-What?

632
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,110
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

633
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,780
She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did.

634
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:03,400
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is
working for the Red Room present day?

635
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,820
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

636
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,740
Uh...

637
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,660
I don't think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg.

638
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,410
No, we're good. We'll make it.

639
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,040
Okay.

640
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,600
You should've brought the Avengers' superjet.

641
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,730
I swear, if I hear one more word from him,

642
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,740
-I will kick him in the face.
-He's the worst.

643
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,820
Natasha.

644
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,370
Natasha. Natasha.

645
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:51,450
Come here, I want to ask you something.

646
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,540
-Come, it's important.
-What?

647
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,630
Did he talk to you about me?

648
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,000
What?

649
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,180
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

650
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,340
Who? What are you talking about?

651
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,760
Captain America.

652
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:14,890
My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

653
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,890
Not so much a nemesis.

654
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,980
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

655
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,360
I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect...

656
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,570
Wait. You haven't seen either one of us in 20 years

657
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,280
and you're gonna ask me about you?

658
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,570
What is with this tension?

659
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:31,830
Did I do something wrong?

660
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,000
Is that a serious question?

661
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,250
I only ever loved you girls.

662
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,920
I did my best to make sure you would succeed

663
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,920
to achieve your fullest potential,

664
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,760
-and everything worked out.
-Everything worked out?

665
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,300
Yes. For you, yes.

666
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,430
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

667
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,970
Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin

668
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,350
the world has ever known.

669
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,480
No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness.

670
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,610
And Natasha,

671
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,650
not just a spy, not just toppling regimes,

672
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,950
destroying empires from within,

673
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,280
but an Avenger.

674
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,160
You both have killed

675
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,710
so many people.

676
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:22,960
Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red.

677
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,710
I couldn't be more proud of you.

678
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,470
Okay. You can... No.

679
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,390
Let go of me now.

680
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,350
You smell really bad.

681
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,230
So, are we there yet?

682
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,440
You'll know when we're there.

683
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,150
Slight right.

684
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,700
Straight on.

685
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,530
Right.

686
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,160
Slight right.

687
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,500
Oh, very good, my darling.

688
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,830
Yes, very good.

689
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,090
Yes, very good, my darling.

690
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,730
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

691
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,570
Honey, we're home.

692
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,500
Come on, girls.

693
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,300
Welcome to my humble abode.

694
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,720
Make yourself at home.

695
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,450
Hey, no funny business.

696
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,870
I am putting away my weapon.

697
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,940
Are there any booby traps around here?

698
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,110
Anything we need to know about?

699
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,900
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

700
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,820
You didn't raise us at all.

701
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:39,450
Oh, maybe so.

702
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:43,120
But if you got soft, it wasn't on my watch.

703
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,350
Let's drink.

704
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,440
Okay.

705
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,990
Still fits.

706
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,200
Oh, my God.

707
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,620
I never washed it once.

708
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,380
Come and drink.

709
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,340
Rise, you workers of salvation

710
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,220
Family

711
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,850
back together again.

712
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,640
-Mmm.
-Seeing as our

713
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:49,890
family construct

714
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,850
was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years,

715
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:57,360
I don't think that we can use this term anymore, can we?

716
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:59,990
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

717
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,280
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

718
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,530
And, uh...

719
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,120
I want to say something right off the bat.

720
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,410
You haven't aged a day, huh?

721
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,710
You're just as beautiful and as supple as
the day they staged our marriage.

722
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,670
You got fat.

723
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,970
But still good.

724
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,890
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

725
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,350
-I have a lot of energy.
-Oh!

726
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,350
Please don't do that.

727
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,440
So, here's what's gonna happen.

728
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,020
Natasha, don't slouch.

729
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,900
-I'm not slouching.
-Yes, yes, you are.

730
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,980
I don't slouch.

731
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,190
You're going to get a back hunch.

732
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,610
-Listen to your mother.
-Oh, my God, this...

733
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,700
Up, up.

734
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,200
All right, enough. All of you.

735
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,120
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

736
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,780
-Here's what's gonna happen...
-I don't want any food.

737
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,950
Eat a little something, Yelena, for God's sake.

738
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,790
You're gonna tell us the location of the Red Room.

739
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,500
You know, it's like when you told them

740
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,710
that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus.

741
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,970
What? That was fun.
You know, "He come down the chimney, girls.

742
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,380
"Look out. Where is he?"

743
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:07,350
You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone,

744
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,390
then you see he's there.

745
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,430
No, no. What? I want them

746
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,140
-to follow their dreams.
-No good.

747
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,350
Reach for the stars, girls.

748
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,020
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

749
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:22,070
You can't defeat a man who commands the very will of others.

750
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,110
You never saw the culmination of what we started in America.

751
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,620
Nor did you.

752
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,500
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

753
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,630
Come in.

754
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:51,520
Did that pig just open the door?

755
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,770
Yes. It did.

756
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,690
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

757
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,480
You named a pig after me?

758
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,860
You don't see the resemblance?

759
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,280
See, he sits just like dog.

760
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,700
Amazing. Now, watch.

761
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,160
It's a little weird, to me.

762
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,830
Stop breathing.

763
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:21,550
We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio.

764
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,260
It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

765
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:26,590
Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time.

766
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,300
In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project,

767
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:31,350
they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain

768
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:36,190
to create the first and only cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

769
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:37,770
Was the hub for cognition.

770
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,230
Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning.

771
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,530
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

772
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,530
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

773
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,370
What are you doing?

774
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,170
Oh, I am explaining that the science is now so exact,

775
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,540
the subject can be instructed to stop breathing

776
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,590
and has no choice but to obey.

777
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,260
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

778
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,300
Yes, all right.
Well, don't worry, Alexei could've survived

779
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:12,050
11 more seconds without oxygen.

780
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,020
Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it's safe.

781
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,640
You go. You go back home, back home where it's safe.

782
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,060
Good boy, Alexei.

783
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,860
The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled.

784
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,400
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents planted around the globe.

785
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,700
And do you know who they test it on?

786
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,120
Hmm...

787
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,950
No. That's not my department.

788
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,910
Ah, come on, come on.

789
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,960
-Don't lie to them. Hmm?
-I'm not lying.

790
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,580
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

791
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,750
What were you?

792
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,500
If I was his architect, you were his partner.

793
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:44,630
You were his business partner.

794
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,000
No, no, no. I was patsy!

795
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,380
-Don't give me that...
-He sell me ideology.

796
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,720
-Stop with the politics.
-All the while, bigger...

797
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,680
Shut up! You are an idiot.

798
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:58,770
And you're a coward.

799
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,730
You're a coward.

800
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,020
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

801
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,820
We're moving on.

802
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,320
Never family, huh?

803
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:15,160
In my heart, I am simple man.

804
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,330
And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents

805
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,540
I think we did pretty great as parents, huh?

806
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:25,170
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

807
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:28,010
Who cares? That wasn't real.

808
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,720
-What?
-That wasn't real. Who cares?

809
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,630
Don't say that.

810
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,720
Please don't say that.
It was real.

811
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:39,430
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

812
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,350
You were my real mother.

813
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,150
The closest thing I ever had to one.

814
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,110
The best part of my life was fake.

815
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,950
And none of you told me.

816
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:58,040
And those agents

817
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,830
you chemically subjugated around the globe?

818
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,460
That was me.

819
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,750
Mmm.

820
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,630
And you, you got out.

821
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,180
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

822
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,060
Are you gonna say anything?

823
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
No.

824
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,060
Don't touch me.

825
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Yelena.

826
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,980
No.

827
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,320
-I had no idea.
-It's okay, it's okay.

828
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,370
I'll go talk to her.

829
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,930
I came in here because I didn't want to talk.

830
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,760
Okay.

831
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,930
We, uh... We just sit.

832
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,270
We just sit.

833
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:20,990
Where are you going?

834
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,500
-To do this myself.
-Don't. You won't survive.

835
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,000
I wish I could believe that you cared.

836
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:29,000
But you're not even the first mother that abandoned me.

837
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,300
No, you weren't abandoned.

838
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,420
You were selected by a program

839
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,510
that assessed the genetic potential in infants.

840
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,140
I was taken?

841
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,060
I believe a bargain was struck, your family paid off.

842
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,110
But your mother, she never stopped looking for you.

843
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,200
She was like you in that way.
She was

844
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,910
relentless.

845
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,280
What happened to her?

846
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,750
Dreykov had her killed.

847
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,870
Her existence threatened to uncover the Red Room.

848
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,340
Normally, the actions of one curious civilian

849
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,500
wouldn't warrant an execution,

850
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,380
but, as I said, she was relentless.

851
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,970
I thought about her every day of my life.

852
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,390
Whether or not I admitted it to myself, I did.

853
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,230
I've always found it best not to look into the past.

854
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:46,870
Then why did you save this?

855
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:06,720
I remember this day.

856
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,850
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving,
Easter and summer vacation all in one day.

857
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,480
-Different backdrops.
-Mmm.

858
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,490
I knew all the presents under the tree were
just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

859
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,320
I wanted to open every single one...

860
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,540
so just for a second it would feel real.

861
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,500
Let's stop this.

862
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,550
Why you doing this?

863
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,640
Why does a mouse born in a cage run on that little wheel?

864
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,430
Do you know I was cycled through the Red Room

865
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:49,100
four times before you were even born?

866
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:50,680
Those walls are all I know.

867
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,690
I was never given a choice.

868
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,400
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

869
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,030
You were just born in a cage, but that's not your fault.

870
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,950
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

871
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,090
Pain only makes us stronger.

872
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,010
Didn't you tell us that?

873
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,430
What you taught me kept me alive.

874
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,140
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

875
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,270
They'll be here any minute.

876
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,730
So, there I am ice fishing with my father.

877
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,950
It's very cold day in this little ice shed.

878
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,400
Cold even for Russia, you know?

879
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:47,320
"Keep the vodka by the fire," my father would say to me.

880
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,620
Please stop talking.

881
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,740
-Please wait. Please wait.
-Please, no.

882
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:50,830
Please, I don't want to talk.

883
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,450
Please. Please.

884
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,790
There is a reason why I'm telling you this, okay?
Trust me.

885
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,460
I am reaching for fish.

886
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,920
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

887
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:04,010
Splash!

888
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:06,010
My hands go in the river.

889
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:10,180
In this weather, frostbite sets in quick.

890
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,350
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

891
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,640
Oh, my God.

892
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:20,610
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius, staves off the frostbite.

893
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,280
How is this relevant?

894
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,360
You know,

895
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,150
fathers.

896
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,290
No. No.

897
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:35,460
You have done nothing but tell me how bored you were.

898
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:39,840
I was the chore, the job you didn't want to do.

899
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,500
To me?

900
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:44,760
To me, you were everything.

901
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,800
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

902
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,720
The only thing you care about are your stupid glory days

903
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:57,140
as the Crimson Dynamo, and no one wants to hear about it.

904
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,650
It's the Red Guardian.

905
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,900
Get out.

906
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,860
Get out!

907
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,880
I can't remember

908
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,880
If I cried

909
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,680
When I read about his widowed bride

910
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,930
Something touched me deep inside

911
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,270
The day

912
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,230
The music

913
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,480
Died

914
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,690
And they were singing

915
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,910
-Bye
-Bye

916
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,660
-Miss American Pie
-American Pie

917
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,750
Drove my Chevy to the levee

918
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,540
-But the levee was dry
-Was dry

919
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,460
Them good old boys

920
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,960
Drinking whiskey

921
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:07,880
Singing

922
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,260
"This will be the day that I die"

923
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,470
"This'll be the day..."

924
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,370
Get down.

925
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,210
They think...

926
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,440
I'm sorry.

927
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,540
Let's not keep him waiting.

928
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,070
Request clearance for landing.

929
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,660
Melina?

930
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,330
We're touching down in one minute.

931
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,120
Then why are we still going up?

932
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:51,800
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

933
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,710
My God.

934
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,380
So, uh,

935
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,590
how was the family reunion?

936
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,640
Oh, it was awful.

937
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,890
They were clingy,

938
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,100
and too emotional, and needy.

939
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,640
-Just like old times, huh?
-Hmm.

940
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:30,230
Yelena Belova.

941
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:32,100
What's the deal with her?

942
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,520
She was the only one affected, right?

943
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,230
As far as I know, yes.

944
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:39,360
These gasses and antidotes,

945
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,610
it's a pain in my ass.

946
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,160
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

947
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,580
Hmm. I have nine pigs

948
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,660
that will require attending to in my absence.

949
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:52,040
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

950
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,510
Cut her brain out...

951
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,010
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

952
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,110
This is a much less cool way to die.

953
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,490
Alexei.

954
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,000
What about Romanoff?

955
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,460
She's a traitor.

956
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,420
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

957
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,340
She had nothing.

958
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:49,310
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

959
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,100
Put that thing in her you do.

960
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:54,350
You know, uh, chemicals.

961
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,520
Turn her into one of your pigs.

962
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:03,650
Can you imagine what I could do with an Avenger under my control?

963
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,280
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

964
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:09,870
When you look into the eyes of a child you have raised,

965
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:13,410
no mask in the world can hide that.

966
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,470
Welcome home.

967
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:32,140
Now, now.

968
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:35,600
Don't go breaking my new toy.

969
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,770
Natasha.

970
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,940
I can't save us.

971
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,740
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

972
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,780
I pledged my life to a cause.

973
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:50,280
You know, I thought I was being very brave.

974
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,580
Possibly the bravest.

975
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:54,250
But I wasn't being brave.

976
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,960
I was coward.

977
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,210
In Cuba,

978
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,050
when they came and took you away from me...

979
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,930
No cause is worth that.

980
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,850
You should only sacrifice yourself

981
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:18,270
for something...

982
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,990
How did you do that?

983
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,030
I designed these cells myself.

984
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,410
What?

985
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,250
What?

986
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:42,130
I bared my soul to you and it was just you the whole time?

987
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:45,880
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

988
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:49,050
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

989
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,180
You have a two-inch blade concealed in your beltline.

990
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,350
What?

991
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,520
What are you going to do to me?

992
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:00,850
Outside right hip.

993
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:30,220
You couldn't have told me sooner?

994
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,390
Don't throw a fit.

995
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:32,850
-There wasn't time.
-Okay, girls,

996
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:34,180
I'm having trouble hearing you,

997
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,140
but, Natasha, there's something I need you to know.

998
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,980
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

999
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:45,570
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1000
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,780
You don't have earpiece.

1001
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,490
What?

1002
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,780
No, she can't hear you.

1003
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,360
-You don't have earpiece.
-Why not?

1004
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:53,820
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1005
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:55,530
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1006
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,330
So, once we're inside,

1007
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,000
I'll activate my tracker and Ross will come running.

1008
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,670
You are aware that you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1009
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,630
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1010
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,090
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1011
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,930
Once I'm out, I can activate the landing protocol,

1012
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:14,510
we can descend within the hour.

1013
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,260
Ah, problem.

1014
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,020
I only have one earpiece set.

1015
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,930
I'll give it to Yelena.

1016
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,690
Where did he take the vials?

1017
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:24,770
Probably down to cold storage.

1018
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,270
Dreykov still has the widows under his control,

1019
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,030
so you have to expose them to this antidote.

1020
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,410
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1021
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:35,910
Is this your plan?

1022
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:37,700
My plan is to kill you.

1023
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:39,290
I'm alive.

1024
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,120
So, what do we do now?

1025
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,500
What was my mother's name?

1026
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,170
Ah...

1027
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,340
Where we buried her,

1028
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:55,840
there was a tree...

1029
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,890
Um...

1030
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:59,850
A pink blossom.

1031
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,730
Beautiful.

1032
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,640
And there was a tombstone

1033
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,440
with her name engraved on it.

1034
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,730
What was her name?

1035
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:16,030
"Unknown."

1036
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,370
You don't feel anything?

1037
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,910
You feel anything when I killed your daughter?

1038
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,330
Is this your haunted past?

1039
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:43,640
Thank you, Natasha.

1040
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,480
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1041
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,320
Say hello.

1042
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,010
When your bomb exploded,

1043
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:15,720
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1044
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:23,310
I had to put a chip in the back of her neck.

1045
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:25,810
In the back of her neck.

1046
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,190
Look at her.

1047
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:30,900
You find it difficult to look at her?

1048
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,150
I do.

1049
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:36,650
She... She watches everything

1050
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:38,740
and she can do it.

1051
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,330
She's a perfect mimic.

1052
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,250
And she fights just like all of your friends.

1053
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,500
Can she hear me?

1054
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,090
What?

1055
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,300
You want to make her feel better?

1056
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,930
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1057
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:11,150
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1058
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:15,690
But enough of all this bullshit.

1059
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:18,150
Go to work.

1060
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,360
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1061
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,160
Go.

1062
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,340
Well, that was a mistake.

1063
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:39,090
Was it?

1064
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:42,640
You just sent away the one thing that
would stop me from killing you.

1065
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:45,390
Try, then.

1066
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,770
Do it.

1067
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,060
Is the safety on?

1068
01:36:58,150 --> 01:36:59,150
No.

1069
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,830
Try your knife.

1070
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,790
Ah...

1071
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,880
You're in trouble.

1072
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,380
How are you controlling me?

1073
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:18,590
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1074
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,630
Well, not yet.

1075
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:23,430
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1076
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,180
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1077
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,400
I'm very upset with Melina.

1078
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,440
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1079
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:39,780
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1080
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,700
press buttons and hack computers...

1081
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
-Yes.
-I mean, I don't know.

1082
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:43,950
There's nothing for me to do.

1083
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:46,870
I want to...
I want to break something.

1084
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,950
Oh, you do?

1085
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,330
Oh, there is something you can break.

1086
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,930
Melina, if this is the last time that we...

1087
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,770
Ah, damn it.

1088
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,580
That was disgusting.

1089
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,130
Okay.

1090
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:07,660
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1091
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:12,870
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1092
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,710
Oh, no, no, no.

1093
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:26,550
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1094
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,720
Pathetic, huh?

1095
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,550
Yeah, what would you call it?

1096
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,890
-I would call it...
-When was the last time

1097
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:32,350
that you had a conversation with somebody

1098
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:34,270
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1099
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:37,390
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1100
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:41,320
The real war was fought here, in the shadows.

1101
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,070
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1102
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:44,440
You hid in the dark.

1103
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,410
Real power comes from undetectable influence.

1104
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:50,990
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1105
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,490
You're nothing.

1106
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,790
-Hmm.
-You have nothing.

1107
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:56,870
There are 50 people on this planet...

1108
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,290
Oh, stop it.

1109
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,080
Don't tell me to stop!

1110
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:04,170
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1111
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,260
Come on.

1112
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:11,260
Think I can't take a punch?

1113
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:12,430
Oh.

1114
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:17,430
-God damn it, you're weak.
-Weak?

1115
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,770
I bet it's easier to be tough in front
of defenseless little girls, huh?

1116
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:21,560
That's enough.

1117
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:33,280
You wouldn't be so glib

1118
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:37,120
if you had any notion of the scope of what I've built.

1119
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:41,330
I own this world. Me.

1120
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,250
You seem desperate to impress me.

1121
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:44,750
I don't need to impress you.

1122
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,420
I don't need to impress anyone.

1123
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:51,800
These world leaders, these great men,

1124
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,470
they answer to me and my widows.

1125
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:00,310
Look at them.

1126
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,820
These girls were trash.

1127
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,030
They are thrown out into the street.

1128
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:11,780
I recycle the trash.

1129
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,820
And I give them purpose.

1130
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:17,450
I give them a life.

1131
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:26,920
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1132
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,300
I've had a slight setback.

1133
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,090
You'll need to get to the widows.

1134
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,200
It's my network of widows

1135
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,410
that help me control the scales of power.

1136
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:02,830
One command, the oil and stock markets crumble.

1137
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,090
One command, and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1138
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,380
My widows can start and end wars.

1139
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:13,340
They can make and break kings.

1140
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,890
You control all of that from here?

1141
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,520
And with you,

1142
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:26,230
an Avenger under my control,

1143
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:30,070
I can finally come out of the shadows

1144
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:35,950
using the only natural resource that
the world has too much of.

1145
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,910
Girls.

1146
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:51,590
All from that little console?

1147
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,550
Yeah.

1148
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,640
Oh, you find this amusing?

1149
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,470
Why are you smiling?

1150
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,180
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1151
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

1152
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:13,240
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1153
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,950
you won't be able to take it from him.

1154
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:19,490
For years, Dreykov has implemented a pheromonal lock

1155
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,490
in all widows, even me.

1156
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,250
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1157
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:28,040
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1158
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:29,670
Not enough.

1159
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,550
This is basic science.

1160
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:34,970
Natasha, to block receptors in olfactory center,

1161
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:37,180
you have to sever the nerve.

1162
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,350
I can handle that.

1163
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,640
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1164
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,270
I'll have to finish it myself.

1165
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,400
What are you going to do?

1166
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,650
Sever the nerve.

1167
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,470
Melina!

1168
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:29,390
Precisely what I was thinking.

1169
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:43,870
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1170
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:47,330
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1171
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:51,380
Fantastic.

1172
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,040
I'm heading to the widows now.

1173
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,550
No.

1174
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,750
We have to go.

1175
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,720
Not so talkative now, are you?

1176
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,470
You took my childhood.

1177
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,640
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1178
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:51,850
But you're never gonna do that to anybody ever again.

1179
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,870
Nobody leaves this room until she's dead.

1180
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:09,200
Make her suffer.

1181
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:12,830
I don't wanna hurt you.

1182
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:14,830
You don't wanna hurt me.

1183
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,070
Hey.

1184
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:11,450
Are you okay?

1185
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:13,870
That looks like it hurts.

1186
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,250
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1187
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,420
I'm sorry.

1188
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,170
Get as far away from here as possible.

1189
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:28,720
You get to make your own choices now.

1190
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,980
We gotta get outta here.

1191
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:42,230
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1192
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:43,520
I'm right behind you.

1193
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:53,530
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1194
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:34,830
Yes!

1195
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,510
Do you see the girls?

1196
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,390
No!

1197
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,840
We need to go back.

1198
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,780
We've lost control.

1199
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:06,310
Antonia.

1200
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:14,320
I'm gonna open the door.

1201
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,950
You're gonna come after me.

1202
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:19,320
It's okay. It's okay.

1203
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,620
I know you're still in there.

1204
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:28,460
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1205
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:43,870
Yelena!

1206
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,910
She's on the wing!

1207
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:49,450
Move! What are you waiting for?

1208
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Don't do it!

1209
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,630
This was fun!

1210
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:55,840
No!

1211
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:45,320
Okay.

1212
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,030
Let's go.

1213
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,090
Enough.

1214
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:56,890
I'm sorry.

1215
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,480
I'm sorry.

1216
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:03,270
Is he gone?

1217
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:09,070
He's gone.

1218
01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:28,090
Yelena!

1219
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,230
Yelena?

1220
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:49,150
We're both upside down.

1221
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:05,460
I should've come back for you.

1222
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:06,800
You don't have to say that.

1223
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,170
-It's okay.
-Hey. Hey.

1224
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:10,300
It was real to me, too.

1225
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,560
Thank you.

1226
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:41,790
Everybody good?

1227
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:44,370
I am clearly injured.

1228
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:47,710
You got something to say?

1229
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:50,090
I'd just mess it up.

1230
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,360
Here comes the cavalry.

1231
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,780
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1232
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:16,450
So, what's our plan?

1233
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:19,950
You guys go. I'll stay.

1234
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,080
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1235
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:24,040
-I’ll hold them off.
-Natasha, we fight.

1236
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:25,670
-We can't split up.
-You're so pigheaded.

1237
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:28,000
-You guys, go.
-Oh, my God.

1238
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,920
Besides, if it can work out with the four of us, you know,

1239
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,510
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1240
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,970
Little bit.

1241
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:39,050
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1242
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,770
I know how much you like it.

1243
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:43,730
Shucks.

1244
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:45,060
It does have a lot of pockets.

1245
01:59:45,230 --> 01:59:47,230
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1246
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,520
He had widows implanted all over the world.

1247
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,570
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1248
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,900
but you should be the one to tell 'em it's over.

1249
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:16,680
You came back for us.

1250
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,810
Thank you.

1251
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:33,110
Hey.

1252
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:36,570
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1253
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:37,860
Don't worry. I got this.

1254
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,490
I know.

1255
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:52,790
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1256
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,800
Come. Come with us.

1257
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,600
You ever not sleep?

1258
02:02:32,770 --> 02:02:36,150
I've been in six different time zones in three days because of you.

1259
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,610
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1260
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:40,240
What, are you scrapping together some parts?

1261
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,950
What'd you get me this time, like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1262
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:51,410
You see what I can get you with a bit of time and money?

1263
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,050
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

1264
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:01,840
It would really be good for me to hear it. Really.

1265
02:03:03,090 --> 02:03:04,260
I'm impressed.

1266
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:06,090
Well, yeah.

1267
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,350
You've always been a really good friend to me.

1268
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,020
That's what every man wants to hear.

1269
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:13,980
Where you gonna go?

1270
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:17,980
It's funny. My whole life, I didn't think I had any family.

1271
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:20,320
Turns out I got two, so...

1272
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:22,110
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1273
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:25,070
I'm gonna go break a few of them out of prison

1274
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:28,080
see if I can't help patch things up.

1275
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:41,920
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1276
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:47,260
What this woman did,

1277
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:50,260
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1278
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:54,520
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1279
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:56,190
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1280
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:58,810
I'm just here paying my respects.

1281
02:12:58,900 --> 02:12:59,980
Hmm...

1282
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,690
You know, coming here makes you look desperate.

1283
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:07,070
Okay.

1284
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,320
I want a raise.

1285
02:13:08,490 --> 02:13:09,820
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1286
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,450
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1287
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:15,910
I've got your next target.

1288
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,830
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1289
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:24,880
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

1290
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:29,590
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
