1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,920
You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,440
- Don't ever betray me again.
- Never.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,040
I need to know
what Sofia's planning

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,760
and who she is planning it with.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Plain dumb Ed.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,520
I would like you to go to
the Narrows and bundle them up,

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,640
bring them back to me.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,600
They're the ones
who started the problem.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,360
They work for Penguin.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,840
I would like to announce
that we just quit

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,960
working for Penguin.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
This is your turf now.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,760
- What is he doing to them?
- He's cooking them.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,880
They are people pies.

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,120
Eat the pies or the boy dies.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,880
Suspect known as the Pyg
is in custody.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
GCPD kept this promise.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,880
I'm not your enemy, Jim.
I never will be.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,800
Did you find anything out?

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,560
He saw Sofia kissing the policeman.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,920
She will answer
for what she's done.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah, Thursday.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
Thursday is my day.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Because it's my day!

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You keep... you keep this...

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
I don't like that song.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
My Ma used to beat me to it.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,680
It was playing when I killed her.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
So now, you turn it off

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,360
or I'll do the same to you.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,640
Why did your mother beat you?

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,960
Were you a naughty boy?

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,760
Did you soil in your trousers?

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,600
Stutter.

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
Perhaps.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,200
Open the gate! Open the gate!
Open the gate now!

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,280
Back off! Back off! Open the gate!

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,880
I really wish you haven't done that.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,760
I paid a fortune to look this good.

41
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,720
Everybody! Stay where you are!

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,480
All right, open the gate,
that's enough!

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay, I told you,
open the gate, let us in!

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,720
The doctors at Arkham
took these after the fight.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
The bigger titanium plate
surgically grafted

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
onto the bones of his face,

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,320
the result of which
radically changed its appearance.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,640
When we booked him,
his fingerprints were burned off.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
I've seen it before on criminals
that wanna hide their identity.

50
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
{\an5}- But never anything like this.
- That's not all.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,120
{\an5}The doctors also noticed
a scar tissue

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
{\an5}behind his ears
and along his neckline

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an5}indicating
he's had multiple surgeries.

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,200
{\an5}That explains why we couldn't
ID him off his photo.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,520
{\an5}This doesn't make any sense,
the Pyg is a glory hound.

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
{\an5}Everything he's done,

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,200
{\an5}it's all been
about grabbing the spotlight.

58
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
{\an5}Classic sociopath behavior.

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,440
{\an5}So, why doesn't he
want us to know who he really is?

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,120
{\an5}Now, is the time he should be
taking credit for his crimes.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,360
Can he use this X- ray
to reconstruct his face?

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
See what he looked like
before he add any work done.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
{\an5}It certainly possible
but it will take some time.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Get started.

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
I wanna know who The Pyg really is.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
{\an5}Morning, Cap.

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
{\an5}Barbara.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,160
{\an5}- How's your shoulder?
- This? Just a scratch.

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
You got a visitor.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
{\an5}Thanks.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
{\an5}Sofia.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,760
{\an5}What are you doing here?

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,440
{\an5}I haven't heard from you
in few days.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,080
{\an5}I didn't realize
I was supposed to call.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
{\an5}I figured after the other night,

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
{\an5}we were gonna start
seeing each other again.

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
{\an5}We're not.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
{\an5}I get it.

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,840
{\an5}You were worried about Penguin

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,200
{\an5}finding out about us
that I made you a captain.

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
{\an5}You don't have to be.
I already told him.

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,280
{\an5}I'm sorry, you did what?

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,760
{\an5}- I have it under control.
- Is that what you think?

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
{\an5}It's what I know.

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,800
{\an5}I'm going to remove Penguin
from the picture

86
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,160
{\an5}and when I do,
I want us to be together.

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
{\an5}It's not gonna work, Sofia.

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,800
{\an5}Even if Penguin
is out of the picture,

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,400
{\an5}I just don't see a way for it
for us, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,400
I run the dog races,
he runs the cockfights.

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,640
Now, he's coming in
muscling on my business.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
I got mouths to feed.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,240
You race those dogs again,
and now, I'll slit your damn throat.

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,960
All right. Enough.

95
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,120
If she stabs him,
it solves the issue.

96
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,360
I started this court

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,040
so we can work out
disputes peacefully.

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,120
This is how things are gonna be done
from now on, understood?

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Now, you're both admitting
to having down months?

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Seems the only solution
is for you to partner up.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Both of you work together,
you stay strong.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay, that's settle.
Thank you. Moving on. Next.

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Wait.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
How's your daughter?

105
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,520
Fever became down.

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Thanks to you, Doc.

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,320
These bums are so lucky to have you.

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,640
You cure their children,
you solve their problems.

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
I haven't forgotten about you, Ed.

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,680
Yes, you say that
and, yet, I remain a moron.

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,800
I said I would fix you, and I will.

112
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,200
Out of my way.

113
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
Move! Out of my way!

114
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Out of my way! I need to see the doc.

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
What happened?

116
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,880
Sampson sent his dogs to my shop,
demanding protection money.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
I told them no.

118
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
I said this is your neighborhood now.

119
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm sorry, who's Sampson?

120
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,040
He chose a territory
just south of here.

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,200
All right, go to the clinic.
I'll stitch you up.

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
You know, this was bound to happen.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
You're the new leader
of the Narrows.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Sampson's just testing you, but,

125
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
you have to show him and his people

126
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
that you can't be pushed around.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
What should I send,
Grundy to rip his arms off?

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Look at him.
This is what he lives for.

129
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm asking these people
to settle things amicably.

130
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,520
I can't just be a hypocrite

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,480
and send Grundy every time
I have a problem.

132
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
Okay, what would you like to do?

133
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Hello, Sofia.

134
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Oswald, what a...

135
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,600
pleasant surprise.

136
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
Oh, I assure you.

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Dear.

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,080
There is nothing pleasant about it.

139
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
I have continually
been suspicious of you.

140
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
And yet,

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,840
every turn, you always had
a perfect explanation

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,800
to put my mind at ease.

143
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
But now...

144
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,840
I finally have proof
that you are my enemy.

145
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,720
You lied to me.

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
You told me you hated Gordon.

147
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,760
You are his lover.

148
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,960
Martin saw you kissing him
after the party.

149
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,480
That's ridiculous.

150
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm not sure what Martin
thought he saw,

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,560
but I can assure you

152
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,520
- it was no kiss.
- Enough of your lies!

153
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Our entire friendship,

154
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
the intimacies we shared,

155
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
they were nothing more
than a pathetic charade.

156
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
Oswald, I swear,

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,520
I swear I care for you deeply. I...

158
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Oh, I wish that were true.

159
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
What?

160
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,920
After Martin found out
about you and Gordon,

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480
I did a little digging
into your boyfriend.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Interesting.

163
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,120
He took a trip down south

164
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,560
shortly before you arrived
in Gotham.

165
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Coincidence?

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
I think not.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,920
So you see,
I know that the two of you

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,840
have been plotting to destroy me
from the very beginning.

169
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,560
Bravo, Oswald.

170
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,920
Do you know I was warned
you're a mastermind?

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,120
Turns out, you're an easy mark.

172
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,160
It is truly amazing
what you can accomplish

173
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,720
with goulash and a good foot rub.

174
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
Now, I see the real you.

175
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
I was blind to your manipulations.

176
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,840
But today,
I'm going to correct that mistake.

177
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
You will tell me
the full extent of your plan,

178
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,440
if your father was involved,

179
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
which of my captains you have turned,

180
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,680
and how you intend
to rid me from the city.

181
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Bring him out.

182
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Allow me to introduce you
to The Dentist.

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,640
And he is not the kind
who gives out lollipops

184
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
after the visit.

185
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,080
Captain Gordon.

186
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,760
I wondered if my little scuffle
would bring you here.

187
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm so glad it did.

188
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,560
- I missed our little chats.
- Good.

189
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,760
And you can start by telling me
who you really are.

190
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Don't you know...

191
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,880
Jim, I'm a reflection of you.

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,440
I don't see it.

193
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,160
Jim, you swine.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,520
I want to know
who's hiding behind that mask.

195
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,160
What you see is what you get.

196
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,000
What I see is someone
who craves attention.

197
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
So, why are you concealing
your true identity?

198
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,560
Don't you wanna take the credit
for all your brilliant crimes.

199
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh, I get all the credit,
the whole town.

200
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,240
It's gonna hog wild for the pyg...

201
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
Since I caught you,
you're yesterday news.

202
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,080
- It's not true.
- This is Gotham.

203
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,520
You're a second class psychopath
compared to what we've got.

204
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,160
Jerome Valeska, Fish Mooney,
Penguin.

205
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
They have staying power,

206
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,240
- you don't.
- You're wrong.

207
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,160
I terrified this whole city
for months.

208
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,360
People will remember that.

209
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,960
No, they won't.

210
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,160
In fact,
they've already forgotten you.

211
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
But not you, Jim.

212
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,120
- You're here.
- My final visit.

213
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,440
Now, I'm gonna walk out that door
and never think about you again.

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
Mind games.

215
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,320
You really think
that's gonna work on me.

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,480
Guard, we're done here.

217
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
James, we're not done here.

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
Have a nice life.

219
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
Don't you walk out on me!

220
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You'll never forget me.

221
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,040
I promise you that.

222
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
There you are.

223
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
So...

224
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,520
you're Duck.

225
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,520
I heard you had a giant.

226
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,880
I think that you might have brought
him along with you rather than this

227
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,440
- has been.
- Excuse me...

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Why would I bring Grundy along
for a friendly conversation?

229
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, I understand you had
a deal with Cherry were you left

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
your people alone.

231
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,320
I expect you do the honor
the same with me.

232
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,040
Why would I do that?

233
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
You're not even from the Narrows.

234
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,960
You have no idea how things
work around here.

235
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,960
Maybe you're right.

236
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,600
But I do know that you love money.

237
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm willing to offer you
10 percent of fight night.

238
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
Just don't get around,

239
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm not negotiating. I'm taking.

240
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm taking your clinic.

241
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm taking you club.

242
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm taking your whole damn
neighborhood.

243
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Okay, we try this your way,
let's use Grundy.

244
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
That doesn't sound so good.

245
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
You cough off blood yet?

246
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
What is it to you?

247
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,760
Bad case of Narrows lung
going around.

248
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
What the hell is that?

249
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,880
The new virus.

250
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,360
I have seen it kill
a few people already.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
First you cough up blood

252
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
and more than a few days
you're dead,

253
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,680
unless you have treatments.

254
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,640
I'll sweetened the deal.

255
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,680
I will doctor your people
free of charge.

256
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,800
You're not gonna get
a better offer than that.

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
All right.

258
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
I will be back in a few days

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,760
and negotiate
with whoever takes your place

260
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
after you drown
in your own blood.

261
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,560
I tell you what, doc.

262
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,040
Make it 30 percent of fight night.

263
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,600
- You got yourself a deal.
- It's too much, don't take it.

264
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,200
Come by the clinic later.
We'll see about that cough.

265
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,120
You teeth quite lovely.

266
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,920
I look forward to putting them
in my trophy case.

267
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,120
You have no idea who I am,
do you?

268
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Of course, I do.

269
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,720
You are Don Falcone's daughter.

270
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,120
He killed my brother.

271
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm going to enjoy this.

272
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
It's true he killed your brother

273
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,840
but not your wife, Elaine,
or your son, Joseph.

274
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,040
No, they're still alive.

275
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Probably having lunch
in your two bedroom

276
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,720
on Seventh Ave right now.

277
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,600
See.

278
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,800
I made it a point to learn every
detail of Penguin's organization.

279
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
For instance,
I learned that he only trust

280
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
one man for this type of job, you.

281
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,800
And in the event
that I'm ever tortured,

282
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
my people have instructions

283
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,640
to kill your family.

284
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
Interesting threat.

285
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,160
But no one is going to know
that you were tortured.

286
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,280
Because no one is going
to find your body.

287
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh, because you don't think

288
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,120
I have spies inside
Penguin's organization.

289
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
He's right about me, though.

290
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,080
I have been conspiring
against him for months.

291
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,440
Turning his captains against him
one by one.

292
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,400
And today is the day that
I will finally take him down.

293
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
So if my people
don't hear from me soon,

294
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
your family is dead.

295
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
But if you don't believe me,

296
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
drill away.

297
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Excuse me.

298
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
Restraints need tightening.

299
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,080
A wise decision.

300
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,400
Now, untie me.

301
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,080
Things are finally looking up.

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Wakey wakey.

303
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
Oh, hello.

304
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Barbara Kean.

305
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,520
This ferocious lady is
Tabitha Galavan, and that kitty cat,

306
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,320
that's Selina Kyle.

307
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,520
I know who you are.

308
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
Penguin wants you dead for betraying
him down in the Narrows.

309
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,080
What do you want with me?

310
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
Well, we heard you and Ozzy
are BFF's.

311
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,040
So you're going to try
and leverage me

312
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
to get Penguin not to kill you.

313
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
We have some other demands.

314
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,160
but essentially, yeah.

315
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
That's a good plan,

316
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,480
except for the fact that Penguin
just tried to kill me.

317
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,520
Why would he do that?

318
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,480
Because I am so close
to taking his underworld from him.

319
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,680
You're lying.

320
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,840
Am I?

321
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,160
I've been working Penguin for months.

322
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,080
Manipulating him to behaving
exactly like I want him to.

323
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
Every move he made today,

324
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,560
I orchestrated.

325
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,840
Now, you three,

326
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
are screwing things up. So...

327
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
You want him out of your life,

328
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
let me go.

329
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,400
Maybe she's telling the truth.

330
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
She's a Falcone.

331
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,720
She learned to lie
before she could read.

332
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,320
But...

333
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,440
whether you're a friend a foe
makes no difference to me

334
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,880
because Penguin
will still make the deal.

335
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
Get him on the phone.

336
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
You'll grow into it.

337
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
Because of you,

338
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,120
I was able to vanquish my enemy.

339
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,760
And now,
that you've proven yourself...

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,600
I see a beautiful future
ahead for you.

341
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
I have so much wisdom to impart.

342
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,920
And if you pay attention...

343
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,920
one day all of this could be yours.

344
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
What's wrong?

345
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,000
You mean...

347
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,600
you did not see
Sofia kissing Gordon?

348
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,520
<i>"She wanted me to tell you
they kissed."</i>

349
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,080
Why would she do that?

350
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Unless...

351
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,520
she knew exactly
how I would respond.

352
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,320
She wanted me to confront her.

353
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,280
Instant torture.

354
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Boss.

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
We have a problem.
The dentist is gone.

356
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,680
What happened to Sofia?

357
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
To be honest,
it's still a little unclear.

358
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,280
Barbara Kean has her.

359
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
What?

360
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
How do you know this?

361
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,320
She's on the phone.

362
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
She said she wants
to make a deal.

363
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Barbara.

364
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,400
Hello, Oswald.

365
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
<i>I see you have crawled out from</i>

366
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
whatever rock you were hiding under.

367
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
What are you doing with Sofia?

368
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,480
We scooped her up this morning.

369
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,400
And of course when we did,
we thought she was your best friend.

370
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Turns out, she's your worst enemy.

371
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,960
I want her back.

372
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Name your price.

373
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
We keep the gun shop.
We don't share profits.

374
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,800
And from this point forward,
we operate with complete autonomy.

375
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Fine.

376
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,480
I will send Zsasz over
to collect her.

377
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,800
She had better be there
when he arrives.

378
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
She will be.

379
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,400
And as for you, young man.

380
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,160
Our conversation is not over.

381
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
So this is what the Pyg
used to look like.

382
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
Well, that's him.

383
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
All right,
send it out to police stations

384
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,800
across the country.
Start in the south.

385
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
- The south. Why?
- When I press them,

386
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,600
they spoke in a southern accent.

387
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,000
Could have been that deliberately

388
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,320
- to throw you off?
- No,

389
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,840
he slipped up.

390
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,120
I saw it in his eyes.

391
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,160
It's the best way we've got.

392
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,760
Let's see where it goes.

393
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I don't understand you.

394
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,040
It seems this cough will kill him.
Why not let him die?

395
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,040
No such thing as Narrows lung.
Probably just has bronchitis.

396
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,680
They give him some medicine,
he feels better. Problem solved.

397
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,200
Okay, what about the 30 percent?

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
Once he has that
he's just gonna want more.

399
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Maybe.

400
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,200
Sampson, you son of a bitch.

401
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,680
Now, you see
who you're dealing with?

402
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,320
I know you wanted
to try this your way.

403
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
No more diplomacy, Lee.

404
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,600
Take Grundy, and end this.

405
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
No.

406
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,240
I have a better idea.

407
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,480
- That was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

408
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,680
Because he couldn't wait
to get you off the phone.

409
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,680
We need to get out of here.

410
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
And then what happens?

411
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
You take over from Penguin?

412
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,320
We are not working for anyone
but ourselves.

413
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm not asking you to.

414
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,280
I will give you
everything you want from Penguin.

415
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,160
You're not in
the position to offer us anything.

416
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,400
We're in charge here.

417
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,360
Guys, I think we should listen
to her.

418
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,880
- Why?
- Because Zsasz is standing

419
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
out front holding a rocket
launcher.

420
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Ladies.

421
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,760
I'm gonna break his little Pyg
in half.

422
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Jim!

423
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,000
Sorry, Captain. I tried to stop her.

424
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,280
I told her she had to wait.

425
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,760
It's okay, Detective. I got it.

426
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,120
Sofia? What happened to you?

427
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
I underestimated Oswald.

428
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
He found out we were plotting
against him,

429
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
and he just tried to kill me, Jim.

430
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,000
He can't hurt you here.

431
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,520
If he finds out I'm alive,
he will come after me

432
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
and he won't stop until I'm dead.

433
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,720
You are the Captain of the GCPD.

434
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,600
Your men would follow you anywhere.
Please, please.

435
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,240
Use the position I gave you
and end this.

436
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,520
What are you proposing that I do?

437
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
You have an army.
Just take the fight to Penguin.

438
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
So, this was your plan?

439
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,000
To start a war.

440
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
You knew you didn't have
the numbers to fight Penguin

441
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,720
on their own.
So you made me captain,

442
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
knowing it would come to this

443
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,920
- and I take him out for you.
- Your job is to stop criminals, Jim.

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,760
- And here you go.
- It is not that simple.

445
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
And you know it.

446
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,720
We could bring law and order
back to Gotham.

447
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
This is exactly what you asked for

448
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,080
when you came down south,
and it is yours for the taking.

449
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
You know what has to be done, Jim.

450
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,560
Crush Penguin.

451
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,520
I trusted you, Martin.

452
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,960
You betrayed me.

453
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,080
I think it's time for you
to go back to the orphanage.

454
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,680
- Boss?
- Hold on.

455
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,160
Let the little spy
step out of the room.

456
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
So?

457
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
Place one out
like a great ball of fire.

458
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Good.

459
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Alert the capos.

460
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,760
We are going to unleash a crime wave
to this city like it has never seen.

461
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,200
That will teach Jim Gordon
to align himself with Sofia Falcone.

462
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,160
I wouldn't make
that call if I were you.

463
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,840
I just spoke with Sofia.

464
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,200
She's alive.

465
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,200
And she told me,
you tried to kill her.

466
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,520
Hearsay, Jim.

467
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Been here all day. I have witnesses.

468
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I don't care.

469
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm not here to arrest you.

470
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,520
I came to make a deal.

471
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,120
I think we've both put up
with Sofia long enough.

472
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,440
Victor, would you give us a moment?

473
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay, Jim. You have my attention.

474
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,400
Since the moment
she set foot in Gotham.

475
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,160
Sofia has put us on a path to war.

476
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,320
She's willing to let this city
burn to the ground.

477
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,680
To prove herself to her father.

478
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,120
I can't allow that.

479
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,800
So, what do you want from me?

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm putting her on a train
home tonight.

481
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,600
But I need assurances from you,
you won't get involved.

482
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,320
Not good enough!

483
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,200
She needs to suffer
for what she has done.

484
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,320
That is not gonna happen.

485
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,520
And how do you think
your girlfriend is gonna react

486
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,320
when she realizes you betrayed her?

487
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,000
You think she's gonna run away
quietly?

488
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,960
If she sets foot in Gotham again,
I'll put her behind bars.

489
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
And if I say no?

490
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,560
And I'll have no choice...

491
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,400
but to use the full force
of the GCPD

492
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,680
to tear you apart piece by piece.

493
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,360
That does not sound very pleasant.

494
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,600
It won't be.

495
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,840
I guess, I can put aside
my personal feelings

496
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
for the good of this city.

497
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,120
But I do have one question
for you, Jim.

498
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,640
Once Sofia is gone,

499
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,680
what does that leave us?

500
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,920
No more licenses.

501
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,720
If you or any other criminal
in this city break the law,

502
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,160
my men will enforced.

503
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
But at least you won't to worry
about Sofia again.

504
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
So?

505
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,800
Do we have a deal?

506
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,600
After all we have been through
together, Jim,

507
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,160
it is nice that we can resolve
this matter with diplomacy.

508
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,840
Oh, Doc...

509
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,720
I heard about what happened
to your clinic.

510
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,280
What a shame.

511
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,560
I was looking forward to you
curing my Narrows lung.

512
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,400
I want you to clear out
of the Narrows by the end of the day.

513
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,360
- What did you say to me?
- I think she was pretty clear.

514
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,120
Then allow me to be clear.

515
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
This is my turf
and I'm not going anywhere.

516
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,000
And you two have dug your own graves.

517
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,440
Oh, well, then I guess
you don't want this?

518
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
What's that?

519
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,640
The anecdote to the poison
I had slipped in your drink

520
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
about 30 minutes ago.

521
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,680
Ironic, isn't it?

522
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,360
It's the only thing from
the clinic that wasn't destroyed.

523
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,320
Some vials of medicine
I had mixed

524
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,040
into a deadly combination.

525
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,440
It should be kicking in
right about now.

526
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,760
You're bluffing,
I feel absolutely fine...

527
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,920
I'm sorry, what was that?

528
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Get them!

529
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,360
Come any closer
and I'll destroy this.

530
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Like I said...

531
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,240
leave by the end of the day

532
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
and you'll live.

533
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Deal?

534
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Okay.

535
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh, catch.

536
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
I know you're disappointed but
I am doing this to protect you.

537
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Disappointment doesn't quite
cover it, Jim.

538
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,520
You stay in Gotham
and Penguin will kill you.

539
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't put this on Penguin.

540
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,680
If you have something to say,
I think you should say it.

541
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
We're the same, Jim.

542
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,040
I saw it the first moment we met.

543
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
We both want power.

544
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,160
You wanna deny it but it's true

545
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,360
and it is just easier
to send me away.

546
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,200
Detective Harper, please take
Miss Falcone to the train station

547
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,640
and escort her back home.

548
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,960
Please don't do this.

549
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,440
You better get going.
You'll miss your train.

550
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Gordon put her on the train.

551
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,280
Talk about the turn of events.
I did not see that coming.

552
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What about the kid?

553
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,520
You want me to take him back
to the orphanage?

554
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,360
That won't be necessary.

555
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
Martin, I have been thinking...

556
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,880
I was angry, I did not mean what I...

557
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Martin?

558
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,720
Martin.

559
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,520
Oh, he's cute.

560
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,480
He doesn't talk.

561
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,240
He gives me the creeps.

562
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,080
Let's get this over with.

563
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,800
Nervous about something?

564
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,400
We have a long way to go.

565
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,680
So get comfy.

566
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,840
Tickets, please.

567
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
What?

568
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,800
Hello, Victor.

569
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,040
Where's the boy?

570
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,480
Alive. For now.

571
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,240
If Oswald wants to keep it
that way,

572
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,160
he will meet me
under the Crown Point bridge

573
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
in one hour.

574
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
<i>Next stop, Fielding Stop.</i>

575
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
It's my stop.

576
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Do you mind?

577
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Not at all.

578
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Thank you.

579
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,440
Glad you can make it, Oswald.

580
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,440
Everything will be all right,
Martin, I promise.

581
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,240
Well, that depends on you.

582
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,280
Turn over control
of the Underworld

583
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,480
to me
and I'll let little Martin here...

584
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,640
Keep his head.

585
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,440
The name Falcone used to mean
something in this town.

586
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Wait until your father hears of this,

587
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,960
threatening the life of a child.

588
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,240
- He will be disgusted!
- Wrong!

589
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,280
My father will be proud.

590
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,000
Must be hard to live your whole life

591
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,160
trying to get daddy's approval.

592
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,480
I, myself, can relate seeing
as my parents loved me

593
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,920
without condition.

594
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,200
Say one more word
and I will kill him.

595
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,000
And then I will execute you.

596
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
I am choosing compassion
but I am willing

597
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,520
to change my position.

598
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Don't hurt the boy.

599
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
He's innocent.

600
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,360
I submit!

601
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Go ahead.

602
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
Martin, I want you to know...

603
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm sorry for what I said.

604
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,040
I do care about you.

605
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,240
You know that's true, don't you?

606
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Yes.

607
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,040
Go wait in the car.

608
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,280
You were wise to use the boy.

609
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,080
As you know, my heart
is my greatest weakness.

610
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
But...

611
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,840
I will not allow him
to be used as a pawn

612
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,480
of your game anymore.

613
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,880
You wanted a war? You've got one!

614
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Ed,

615
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,000
why so blue? We had a great day.

616
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,440
You had a great day.

617
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,920
We did nothing to help.

618
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's not true.

619
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Couldn't done without you.

620
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,840
Not meant to be a sidekick, Lee.

621
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,640
Sampson is right. I'm a has-been.

622
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,440
No you're not.

623
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,120
Okay, I sort of trust me with
something today and you did.

624
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,440
So I'm gonna trust you
with something.

625
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,760
I haven't been looking for a cure
for your brain, Ed.

626
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,200
Because there's nothing wrong
with you.

627
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,600
- But you...
- Sure,

628
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
at first there was an effect
from the ice.

629
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,520
But I ran all the test,
it checks out.

630
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,000
There's nothing wrong with you,
physically.

631
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,880
Your condition is psychological.

632
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,880
Think about it.

633
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,760
You knew every move
that Sampson was gonna make

634
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
before he made it.

635
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,080
You lied to me.

636
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,640
Why?

637
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
Because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth

638
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
you would go back to be
who you are before.

639
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
The Riddler.

640
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,880
And I like who you've become.

641
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Who's that?

642
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,440
Ed Nygma.

643
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,880
The Ed that you were before.

644
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
My friend.

645
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,360
Well, that backfired.

646
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,480
Penguin's gonna be coming for us.
What are we gonna do?

647
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,040
We hit him before he hits us.

648
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,040
Lady, you lost.

649
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,240
Penguin just blew up that kid.

650
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,560
I admit I didn't see that coming.

651
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,280
But Oswald still has
to align his capos

652
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
before he moves on us.

653
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
We use that window of time
to make our play.

654
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,480
You didn't get told no a lot
as a kid, did you?

655
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,200
You took a shot and you missed.

656
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,800
- We're going in alone from here.
- You leave now,

657
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,120
and you will never have
a piece of this city.

658
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,080
Now, that sounded like a threat.

659
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,320
Your club is destroyed,
you have nowhere else to turn.

660
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
You need me.

661
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,040
Penguin may have won the battle.

662
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,440
But tomorrow, we win the war.

663
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Boss.

664
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
My boy.

665
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,000
You did a splendid job of dying.

666
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,440
Victor will take you
to a safe location.

667
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,320
You can never return to Gotham.

668
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,440
This is goodbye, my friend.

669
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,760
There, there.

670
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,280
This is what I have to do
to protect you.

671
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,640
One day, when you are older,
you will understand.

672
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Sophia's on our heels, boss.

673
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Let's finish her off.

674
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,840
Let someone else take the kid.

675
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,640
No, I want my top man on this.

676
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,440
Besides,

677
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,080
I have something much better
plan for Sofia Falcone.

678
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
You were right about The Pyg.

679
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,680
A precinct down south recognize
the picture you have me sent down.

680
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,920
His real name is Lazlo Valentine.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
What do we know about him?

682
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,200
He was being held for a string
of murders down there

683
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
ten years ago,
but here's the thing,

684
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,600
his previous victims
weren't police officers

685
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,960
and there was no Pyg persona.

686
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
Serial killers don't usually
change their M.O.

687
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,920
This guy did.

688
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,960
You said he was being held.

689
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,520
Did they say
why their case fell apart?

690
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,240
They didn't. He escaped.

691
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Call Arkham.

692
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,080
Have them put a guard
in the south.

693
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
I'm on my way.

694
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Pyg?

695
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Pyg?

696
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Hello, Ed.

697
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
No.

698
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
No!

699
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,240
Miss me?

700
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,280
Open it. Let's go.

701
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,480
Here they are!
