1
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,839
What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,271
- Because he's on to us. Yeah.
- What do you mean he's on to us?

3
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,313
He's walking to his car,
then suddenly he isn't.

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,238
What, does he have a sixth sense?

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,078
Jesus. What did you say to him?

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,511
Could I ask my own question right now
at this point?

7
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,075
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,398
What, was I supposed to leave it
on his car?

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,194
What, you're supposed to bring it
to a hospital?

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,154
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,554
Look.

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,836
Where can we find Gus?

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,713
Name a place. One place
where I can surprise him...

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,229
...where he won't see me coming.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,077
Because his house, the laundry...

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,272
...the restaurant, factory farm,
all wired with cameras.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,311
One place.

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,188
Think. Jesse, think.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,197
Where is it? Where?

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,755
Because if you can't tell me...

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,757
...we are dead.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,758
Jesse?

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,072
I don't- I don't know.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,119
Well, maybe -

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,629
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,754
- Yeah.
- Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,116
Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,154
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes. Go some place and talk.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,349
About what?

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,028
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- About what?

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,832
It concerns Brock Cantillo...

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,190
...and a statement you made
to his mother.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,879
How about you come with us?

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,958
We just wanna clear a few things up,
no big deal.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,114
- So am I under arrest?
- No, you're not under arrest.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,389
We're just talking.

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,478
So if I get tired of talking,
can I get up and leave?

38
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,875
We'd prefer you didn't.

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,514
- You'd prefer.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,838
Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,270
Look, I think this has been,
you know...

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,791
...what do call it? Overblown.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,718
Because all I basically said was:

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,879
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,911
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,999
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
You helping them out like that.

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,997
Especially how specific you were.

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,031
Ricin, wow.

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,596
Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,872
So when doctors hear that,
they take it very seriously.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,832
As do we.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,873
- As does the FBI.
- Okay.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,548
Nice, you trying to help out
like that and all.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,673
You know, professional courtesy,
sharing your expertise.

55
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,112
Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
I just, you know -

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,470
You happened
to guess this rare poison...

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,717
...might be the thing
that put this boy in the hospital.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,993
Congratulations. Because his doctors,
they think that you might just be right.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,317
So why ricin?
Jesse, how'd you come up with that?

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,196
I think I've- I don't know, I must've
saw it on House or something.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,316
Yeah, you know, like, House
or the Discovery Channel.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,273
Sometimes your brain
just makes these connections.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,198
- Does it?
- Mine does.

64
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,034
That's interesting.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,629
Look, I gotta get back.

66
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,910
But we're still talking.

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,273
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,232
So then, I guess...

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,635
...I should call my lawyer, right?

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,638
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

71
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,434
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,995
You know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,430
Suddenly,
everything's a big pissing match.

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,631
- Like, every time.
- Adversarial.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,149
Adversarial.
Then we gotta book you. Right?

76
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,113
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,272
You're no Boy Scout.

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,073
Saul Goodman.

79
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,032
That's my guy.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,550
So do I gotta call him or do you?

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,673
What the hell are you doing?

82
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,110
- I need Saul. Right now.
- So you break in?

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,550
- You just break in.
- I see you're here.

84
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,355
If you'd answer the phone or the door,
maybe I wouldn't- Forget it.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,075
Is he here?

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,874
Is that a serious question?
Why would he be here?

87
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,275
But you know where he is.
I need a number.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,070
Look, let me explain something
to you.

89
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,475
- My partner and I -
- Are in danger?

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,353
Whoopty-freakingdoo.
Why do you think he's not here?

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,189
And how's that news, exactly,
the two of you being in danger?

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,958
After doing something idiotic?

93
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,674
What gives you the right
to break down my door?

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,235
Look, I just need a number, okay?
That's all.

95
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,989
You are such a pain in my ass,
you know that?

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,998
You're the reason
I gotta go on unemployment.

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,668
I was looking forward
to getting out of here.

98
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,394
But, no,
now I gotta wait around all day...

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,478
...for a guy to come fix this door.
Who pays for this?

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,671
Okay, you know what?

101
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,792
Here, look, I'm giving you everything.
All of it, okay?

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,035
There's one, two...

103
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,956
Look, there's gotta be at least
1700 dollars there, okay?

104
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,516
More than cover the cost of the door.
Now, I apologise profusely.

105
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,915
Please. The phone number.

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,358
A door like this is gonna cost
way more than 1700.

107
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,755
What, for a plate of glass? No.

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,155
Oh, yeah. I bet it does.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,999
I bet you it winds up costing...

110
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,472
...20,000.

111
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,914
Are you insane?

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,591
Who the hell is going to charge
$20,000 for a plate-glass door?

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,234
There's no reputable vendor would -

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,514
Now I'm thinking 25.

115
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,674
I'll be right back.

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,114
Yes. Albuquerque, New Mexico.

117
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,315
The number of Rebecca Simmons,
306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

118
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,229
Would you connect it for me, please?
Thank you.

119
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,152
Becky, hi. It's Walter White.

120
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,873
Listen, I wo -

121
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,436
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?

122
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,910
Oh, good, good.

123
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,076
Yes, cats are...

124
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,395
Listen.

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,478
Skyler and I are out of town,
on our way to Santa Fe...

126
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,797
...and Junior just told us
that he thinks...

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,310
...he may have left the burner on
on the stove.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,796
Yes, God forbid, there's a fire.

129
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,876
Well, that's why I'm calling.
You se- I just wanted to ask...

130
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,550
...and I'm sorry to do this,
but do you still have the key?

131
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,355
You do? Good.
And would you be willing to-?

132
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,235
Oh, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

133
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,795
Yes. Okay.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,879
Okay. I'll await your call.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

135
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,437
There you go.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,673
Becky?

137
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,833
Oh, that's good. That's a relief.

138
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,557
I owe you one. Bigtime.

139
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,431
So how's he doing?

140
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,355
You could at least say, instead
of being a couple dicks about it.

141
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,278
Jesse, if you care at all
about that little boy...

142
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,357
...prove it to me.

143
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,233
Tell us what you know.

144
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,715
- I told you what I know.
- Tell us again.

145
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,833
What are you, like, broken records?

146
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,395
I was trying to be helpful.

147
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,397
End of story.

148
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,398
Guess we'll wait and see
what the tox screen says.

149
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,753
Look at this. Isn't this cosy?
What'd you tell them?

150
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,269
I told them they're a couple of dicks.

151
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,435
He's a wordsmith.

152
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,871
Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go...

153
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,868
...make like you got manners,
make like you respect the rule of law.

154
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,790
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,
hasta luego, get the hell out.

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,709
Bye-bye. That's it, pick it up.
Follow your partner.

156
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,512
And one-two.

157
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,312
Thank you.

158
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,431
Christ. You two-?

159
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,155
If I ever get anal polyps,
I'll know what to name them.

160
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,351
Are you gonna get me out of here?

161
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,998
No. Not even if I could.

162
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,476
You know, the FBI's gonna show up
on this ricin thing...

163
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,752
...and then you're in it
for the duration.

164
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,472
You're a lot safer in here.

165
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,069
They tried to get your partner
in his own home.

166
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,191
Jesus.

167
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,594
Is he okay?

168
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,270
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.

169
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,199
Now, we're all on the clock here
and thanks for that.

170
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,834
Wanna go stick your wangs
in a hornet's nest...

171
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,238
...it's a free country. But how come
I always get sloppy seconds, huh?

172
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,873
You got anything for me? Tell me
I didn't poke my head up for nothing.

173
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,634
Yeah.

174
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,592
I've been thinking...

175
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,552
And?

176
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,469
Casa Tranquila.

177
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,908
What's Casa Tranquila?

178
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,350
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

179
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,711
Our boy tells me Fring took him
to visit one of the patients.

180
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,434
Someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember:

181
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,517
Tio Salamanca.

182
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,355
Old guy in a wheelchair?

183
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,432
Doesn't talk, rings a bell.

184
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,517
I mean, does that ring a bell?

185
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,475
- The guy actually has to ring a bell.
- Yes, I know. I remember.

186
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,835
So, what, once every blue moon...

187
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,589
...Gus goes and visits
an old cartel associate.

188
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,439
That doesn't help me.

189
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,313
I can't hide out in a nursing home
for six months...

190
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,308
...hoping on the off chance
that he comes back.

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,070
It's not even like they're friends.

192
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,477
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

193
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,477
What does that mean?

194
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,115
He told him the last of his family
was dead. He enjoyed telling him.

195
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,959
Pinkman asked him about it.
All Gus would say...

196
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,391
...was that this Tio character
murdered someone close to him.

197
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,153
Wait.
Tio murdered someone close to Gus?

198
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,397
I know,
it sounds not particularly fruitful.

199
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,479
But, sorry, that's all I got.

200
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,389
They're enemies, not friends.

201
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,628
Next number in this cover-all game
where you cover the whole shimoly...

202
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,391
...is B number three,
like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

203
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,910
That's number three
in your B column.

204
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,954
Followed by O, seven, four...

205
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,188
...that's O, 74,
on the other side of your card.

206
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,595
Now we have
that lucky number B, number seven.

207
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,109
Is it lucky for you?

208
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,038
B, seven.

209
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,708
In the I row, two, one.

210
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,876
I, 21.

211
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,548
I know you despise me.

212
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,192
And I know how badly
you wanna see me dead.

213
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,475
But I'm willing to bet that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

214
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,911
Those N's just keep coming.
They're all sticking together.

215
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,471
I'm offering you an opportunity
for revenge.

216
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,671
G column, four, eight...

217
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,714
...the continental United States,
excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

218
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,920
Okay. I'm here.

219
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,430
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca? You need something?

220
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,756
You need to go poopie, huh?

221
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,155
Did you go poopie already? No?

222
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,918
What do you need?

223
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,191
You want me to get
the board for you?

224
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,753
Okay.

225
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,912
All right.

226
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,954
Okay. Here we go.

227
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,229
A, E, I -

228
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,833
Row I. I, J, K, L, M, N -

229
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,792
First letter N.

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,479
A, E -

231
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,593
Row E. E- Second letter E.

232
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,268
A, E- Row E.

233
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,233
E- Next letter E.

234
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,438
A- Row A.

235
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,235
A, B, C, D -

236
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,271
Next letter D.

237
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,277
A- Row A.

238
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,836
A, B, C, D -

239
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,553
Next letter D.

240
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,069
A, E- Row E.

241
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,999
E- E.

242
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,838
A- Row A.

243
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,315
A- Next letter A.

244
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,071
A, E, I, O, U...

245
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,278
I don't think we're finished,
Mr. Salamanca. A, E, I, O, U.

246
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,119
Finish the word, Mr. Salamanca.

247
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,398
Is it "dear?"

248
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,070
Is it "deal?"

249
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,595
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.
Help me out here.

250
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,599
- Hey, son, what's up?
- When exactly are you getting here?

251
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,838
Just as soon as I can.

252
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,669
Look, this is a serious situation
and you're not taking it seriously.

253
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,835
Let me talk to him.

254
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,077
- Son, I am taking this seriously.
- Give it to me, Walter.

255
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,919
I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank
and his safety.

256
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,635
But whomever is making these threats
against him...

257
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,832
...I can assure you,
there's absolutely no interest in me.

258
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,712
I'm not on anyone's radar.

259
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,878
- And besides, your mother and I -
- Give it to me. Walter.

260
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,709
Did you hear what he said?
Get over here. No more excuses.

261
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,037
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

262
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,229
- I promise.
- Hold on.

263
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,711
You wanna weigh in here?
Maybe you can talk sense into him?

264
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,832
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here so...

265
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,030
I hope you sell plenty
of air fresheners.

266
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,390
I hope you have a banner day
over there.

267
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,831
Okay, Walt, don't worry
about a thing here. Goodbye.

268
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,079
And thank you for all of your help.

269
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,759
What's that?

270
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,998
Anything?

271
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,991
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi, Steve.

272
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,953
- How's everybody holding out?
- The man I wanna see.

273
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,832
Come here. Look at this.

274
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,957
- Jesus, enough with the laundry.
- No, no, no, hear me out.

275
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,312
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly,
is 7200 amp service.

276
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,308
This place has two of them, right?
That's a whole lot of juice, brother.

277
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
Laundry this size, typically,
has half that, okay?

278
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,759
What's with the extra panel?

279
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,077
- What are you, Thomas Edison?
- Asked a bunch of electricians.

280
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,636
They have their own chat rooms,
all they talked about was wiring.

281
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,071
Freaking Internet.
Find anything on it these days.

282
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
What do you say?
Pop over, have another look-see?

283
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,353
Listen.

284
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,399
I think we possibly have a lead
on something.

285
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,795
- Yeah?
- I have this guy down at the office.

286
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,116
He says he has some kind
of information.

287
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,359
The thing is, he'll only give it to you,
in person.

288
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,115
Okay.

289
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,675
- Do you remember Hector Salamanca?
- Yeah.

290
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,429
The old cripple guy with the bell?
Rather crap than talk to us?

291
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,871
- No, I don't remember him at all. Why?
- Well, he's the guy.

292
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,349
His nurse calls us,
says he wants to powwow.

293
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,199
So we have this guy at the office
for three hours.

294
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,709
And he still just wants to talk to you.

295
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,833
Do not even think
about going down there.

296
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,600
- Marie -
- This is clearly a ploy or a trick...

297
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,839
...or something designed to get Hank
out into the open. That's all this is.

298
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,110
- Well, that's what we thought.
- Well...

299
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,709
It's been years
since this guy's been a player.

300
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,956
His nephew's gone,
doesn't have anybody.

301
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,595
The nurse checks out,
don't know nothing.

302
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,598
Guess I just don't see an angle
here...

303
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,392
...if there even is one.

304
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,160
Of course,
if you did wanna talk to this guy...

305
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,476
...there's no safer place
than the office.

306
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,395
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

307
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,919
Yeah. I agree, Uncle Hank.

308
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,190
It is a ridiculous idea.

309
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,518
And there's no way
that you're going to do it. End of story.

310
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,831
Hank, thanks for coming down.

311
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,268
No problem at all.

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,198
Good to see you, sir.

313
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,513
So, Mr. Salamanca,
you got something you wanna tell me?

314
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,912
A, E, I, O -

315
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,438
Row O. P, Q, R, S -

316
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,275
First letter S.

317
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,713
A, E, I, O, U -

318
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,354
Second letter U.

319
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,198
A -

320
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,916
B, C -

321
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,153
A, E, I -

322
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,715
J, K -

323
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,629
A, E, I -

324
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,958
J, K, L, M -

325
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,310
A, E, I, O, U -

326
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,435
Row U. V, W, X, Y -

327
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,914
All right. That's enough.

328
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,833
Thank you.

329
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,756
Yeah, thanks. I can spell.

330
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,550
Well, you got that out
of your system now?

331
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,115
Should we try this one more time?

332
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,472
A, E- F -

333
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,352
A, E, I, O, U -

334
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,352
A -

335
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,433
B, C -

336
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,234
Yeah, we got it.

337
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,349
I am- I am- I am just so, so sorry.

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,119
Well, at least this time,
he didn't shit himself.

339
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,471
I guess that's progress.

340
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,788
- Yes?
- We may have a problem.

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,399
I've got eyes on the DEA.

342
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,916
They just had a visitor.

343
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,719
Hector Salamanca.

344
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,671
I don't know what to say to you now.

345
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,999
Sit here and think about how far that
kind of behaviour is gonna get you.

346
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,475
Not far, let me tell you.

347
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,192
Any second thoughts?

348
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,716
Then let's get to work.

349
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,558
Hello.

350
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,711
Hi.

351
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,272
Hi.

352
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,152
Hello.

353
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,992
Hi.

354
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,917
Mr. Pinkman...

355
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,828
...you're free to go.

356
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,829
Why? What happened?

357
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,553
Tox screen came back.

358
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,796
No ricin poisoning.

359
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,071
Surprised, huh?

360
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,556
No, why should I be?

361
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,318
Your jacket.

362
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,752
Till we meet again.

363
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,230
Okay. Okay.

364
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,352
Hey, yo. Yo, right here.

365
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,032
Hey, Andrea.

366
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,549
I'm just checking on Brock.

367
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,957
Hey, it sounds like...

368
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,118
I mean, listen,
just call me if you can, all right?

369
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,915
- I'm heading back over. All right.
- Hey, excuse me.

370
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,315
Yes.

371
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,796
We just picked up Pinkman.
No witnesses.

372
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,228
What about Hector?

373
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,955
I've checked inside and out...

374
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,988
...no wires, no camera,
no surveillance.

375
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,397
Police cruiser rolled through
an hour ago. Seemed routine.

376
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,478
It's just him, alone in his room.

377
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,598
All right.

378
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,434
I'm on my way.

379
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,109
Maybe it's better if I do this myself.

380
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,791
I do this.

381
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,397
It's all clear.

382
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,392
Wait here.

383
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,558
What kind of man talks to the DEA?

384
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,757
No man.

385
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,956
No man at all.

386
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,795
A crippled little rata.

387
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,117
What a reputation to leave behind.

388
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,070
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

389
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,912
Last chance to look at me, Hector.

390
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,871
Oh, my -

391
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,955
All right, all right.

392
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,357
- Let's get going.
- Oh, Jesus.

393
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,152
Oh, Jesus.

394
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,754
Why don't we start evacuating?

395
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,717
- Start evacuation on the south side.
- Call Security.

396
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,751
Everyone outside right now.

397
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,994
- In the same boat for sure.
But it's that time again...

398
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,395
...where we tell you
about your own hell...

399
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,831
...Albuquerque afternoon commute.
How bad are things out there?

400
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,828
I tell you what, right now southbound
25, got an accident at Jefferson.

401
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,554
Make sure you stay to the left
through that area.

402
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,435
Things have slowed to a crawl
at the Big I, no surprises there either.

403
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,918
Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley...

404
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,793
...an explosion has been reported
at a nursing home.

405
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,911
- Casa Tranquila nursing home.
- Oh, no.

406
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,032
You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.

407
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,870
Unfortunately, initial report is though,
that three people may have been killed.

408
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,911
- Oh, no.
- The news is disturbing.

409
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,998
We're gonna get you information
as soon as it comes in.

410
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,670
Situation over there is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like?

411
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,996
If you're moving through that area...

412
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,670
...we're talking about East and
Westbound Paseo, North Valley.

413
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,314
Please, avoid that area
as you move through.

414
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,718
Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.

415
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,390
Coming up on Coyote 102.5,
Aerosmith, Def Leppard.

416
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,034
Keep it right here
on New Mexico's finest rock -

417
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,639
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

418
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,470
Next step, CO2.

419
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,159
Do it.

420
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,633
Hey.

421
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,793
I better hear them click.

422
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,511
What, you got a problem with stairs?

423
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,798
Gus is dead.

424
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,875
We've got work to do.

425
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,119
He's gonna pull through.

426
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,719
Yeah?

427
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,152
Yeah. It looked kind of touch-and-go
there for a while...

428
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,078
...but he's gonna...

429
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,037
He's gonna make it.

430
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,756
Oh, thank God.

431
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,630
Oh, thank God.

432
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,951
You know,
still saying it wasn't the ricin.

433
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,992
I don't understand.

434
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,918
Then what was it?

435
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,717
Saying it was most likely a flower
called lily of the valley.

436
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,277
It's, like, common.

437
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,870
It's got these red berries on it
that I guess taste sweet...

438
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,390
...and sometimes kids eat them
and wind up poisoning themselves.

439
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,478
And that's it, nothing more.

440
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,676
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

441
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,597
Still he had to go...

442
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,199
...right?

443
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,192
Damn right.

444
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,391
Gus had to go.

445
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Yeah.

446
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,318
You know, I should -

447
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,073
I should get back.

448
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,157
Andrea's waiting.

449
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,555
I'm at Casa Tranquila
where three are dead...

450
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,389
...following an explosion
that rocked this facility earlier today.

451
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,273
The fireball completely consumed
one resident's room...

452
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,232
...and damaged common areas
nearby.

453
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,395
Walt?

454
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,750
Let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

455
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,679
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Walt?

456
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,949
How you doing?

457
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,116
How am I doing? How are you doing?

458
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,953
I'm...

459
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,516
I'm doing quite well.

460
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,558
I'm good.

461
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,509
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

462
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,153
Gus Fring is dead.

463
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,030
He was blown up with some person
from some Mexican cartel...

464
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,913
...and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

465
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,913
Do you know about this?

466
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,115
- Walt? I need you to -
- It's over.

467
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,674
We're safe.

468
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,235
- Might've heard a rumbling sound...

469
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,035
...and another reported a, quote,
"ringing" in the moments just prior.

470
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,356
Administrators
at Casa Tranquila advise...

471
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,917
...that if you do have loved ones
in their care, please do not call in...

472
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,917
Was this you?

473
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,237
What happened?

474
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,398
I won.
