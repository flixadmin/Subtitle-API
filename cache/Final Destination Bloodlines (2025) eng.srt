1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,910
What was that?

4
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,410
Nothing.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,610
Okay, just give me one little hint.

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,610
No, no hints.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,970
We're almost there.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,510
Okay, I'm going to take this off.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:38,930
No, no, no.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,110
Hey, you said you like surprises.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,910
Yeah, I do.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,190
When I know what they are.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,710
You're going to love it.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,690
Promise.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,130
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,810
I already love the view.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,030
Ha ha.

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:54,910
Hello.

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,290
Hello.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,390
Hello.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,840
All right, here we are.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,020
Watch your step, watch your step.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,460
I can't see.

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:17,940
Ready?

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,780
Forward, stop.

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm taking it off.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,920
Now.

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,600
Are you kidding?

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,760
How?

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,700
I didn't even know this place was open

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,940
yet.

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,100
Pulled some favors and got us on the

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
list for opening night.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh!

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,120
You look really ugly.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,760
Wow, uh...

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,660
Are you sure I'm dressed all right?

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,340
You look like a million bucks.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Come on.

40
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,940
Hey!

41
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,870
Don't steal coins from the fountain.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,910
It's bad luck.

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,790
Sorry sir.

44
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,270
Go on.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,880
Smile.

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,520
Hello, sir.

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,260
Would you like a photo?

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Thank you.

49
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,210
Watch your step, everyone.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
You coming?

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Uh, we'll...

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,640
take the next one.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,640
Aw, come on.

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,480
We can fit you in.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Thanks.

56
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,010
Going up.

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,330
Oh, excuse me.

58
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,850
Sorry, it does that sometimes.

59
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,310
Ah!

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,140
Some fun facts about the Scadvey Tower.

61
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,820
It's 494 feet tall and weighs over 9

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,640
,000 tons.

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,820
It's made of steel and reinforced concrete and

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,200
glass.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,120
And even more impressive, the entire project was

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,060
completed five months ahead of schedule.

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,380
Is that a good thing?

68
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,320
What'd I tell you?

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Nancy?

70
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,800
Yes?

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,680
May I help you?

72
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,960
We have a reservation.

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,640
Campbell.

74
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,050
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're already over capacity

75
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,090
for opening night.

76
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,450
We cannot accommodate you.

77
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,150
If you wouldn't mind just stepping aside.

78
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,870
Thank you so much.

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,190
It's okay.

80
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,570
I worked it out with Jake.

81
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,090
Is he here?

82
00:04:59,210 --> 00:04:59,530
I could speak...

83
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,810
We let Jake go this morning.

84
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,330
Thank you so much.

85
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,570
What's going on?

86
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,190
One second.

87
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,590
One second.

88
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,570
Sir, you're a very important man.

89
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,390
Maybe you could help me out.

90
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,550
Excuse me.

91
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,950
Excuse me.

92
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,330
Please.

93
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,950
You're tearing me apart.

94
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,510
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

95
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,710
If you wouldn't mind.

96
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh, Mr. Fuller, how nice to see you.

97
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,590
We have a lovely table for you.

98
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,270
Thank you.

99
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,970
Let's go to the bar.

100
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,590
What?

101
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,930
Act natural.

102
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,840
Look at the view.

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,840
What?

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,780
I don't know.

105
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,240
You're scared of heights?

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,660
No, I'm just...

107
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,340
I've just never been this high up before.

108
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,740
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,740
This night's turning into such a disaster.

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,820
I really wanted it to be perfect.

111
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,440
Hey.

112
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,370
It is perfect.

113
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,110
Because I'm with you.

114
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,430
Ah.

115
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,550
You okay?

116
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,590
I think I'll live.

117
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,010
Yeah?

118
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,190
Hey, look, free champagne.

119
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,030
That's my favorite kind.

120
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,530
Want me to ride up?

121
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,020
Okay.

122
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,340
I'll be right back.

123
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,480
Excuse me, where's the ladies' room?

124
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
Other side of the dance floor.

125
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,820
And I tumbled from the sky I got

126
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,060
to feeling I'm a-falling Loving you's the

127
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:32,910
reason why The reason

128
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:39,250
why You're the reason why Thank you.

129
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,170
We'll be right back.

130
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,550
Hi, sweetie.

131
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,150
Is everything all right?

132
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,370
I'm fine, thank you.

133
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,650
How far along are you?

134
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,270
What?

135
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,130
Oh, no, I'm not.

136
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,920
I don't know exactly.

137
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Maybe one or two months.

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,360
That's wonderful news.

139
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,960
Isn't it?

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,140
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

141
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,940
Does he love you?

142
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

143
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,049
Then he won't let go.

144
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,090
Thank you.

145
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:39,830
Of course.

146
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:40,650
Bye.

147
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,530
Okay, it's almost over.

148
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,070
Oh.

149
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,830
Hey, what?

150
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,330
Are you okay?

151
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,710
Yeah.

152
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,430
I think so.

153
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,350
Come on.

154
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,210
Let's get some fresh air.

155
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,730
I really need to...

156
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,270
I'm sorry, I wanted to...

157
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,090
You go first.

158
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,750
Okay.

159
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,710
I was going to do this at dinner,

160
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,970
but seeing as we have this view...

161
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,810
Hey, don't throw that penny.

162
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,890
You could kill somebody.

163
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,050
Oh, I'm so sorry.

164
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,670
Of course.

165
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,110
Fat ass.

166
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,450
Um...

167
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,170
These past few years have been absolutely magical.

168
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,390
And that's, uh...

169
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,970
That's because of you.

170
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,950
Iris, I want to spend the rest of

171
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,610
my life with you.

172
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,510
You mean...

173
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,870
With us?

174
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,980
What?

175
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,460
Sorry.

176
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,240
I...

177
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

178
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,040
What?

179
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,900
You're not upset?

180
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,940
Are you kidding me?

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,140
No, this is...

182
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,380
This is incredible.

183
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:32,920
Really?

184
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,300
We're going to start a family.

185
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,020
Um, so...

186
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,740
Will you?

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,660
Oh, yes.

188
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,960
Is it too tight?

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,140
It's perfect.

190
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey, let's go celebrate.

191
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,940
Shut up!

192
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,740
Shut up!

193
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,080
Shut up!

194
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,860
Shut up!

195
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,340
Shut up!

196
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,100
Shut up!

197
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,840
Shut up!

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,180
Shut up!

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,540
Shut up!

200
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,820
Shut up!

201
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,220
Shut up!

202
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
Shut up!

203
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,780
Shut up!

204
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Shut up!

205
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,140
Shut up!

206
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,260
Shut up!

207
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,220
Shut up!

208
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,260
Shut up!

209
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,640
Shut up!

210
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,740
Shut up!

211
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,840
Shut up!

212
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:26,940
Shut up!

213
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,040
Shut up!

214
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,140
Shut up!

215
00:13:32,580 --> 00:14:43,200
That has to mean my eyes will...

216
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,090
Children first!

217
00:14:48,250 --> 00:15:02,230
To the

218
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,650
elevator!

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,020
Move!

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,720
Oh no.

221
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,160
Help.

222
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,140
Help.

223
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh, I'll be right there.

224
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,380
Aghhhh!

225
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,610
Help me!

226
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,140
Well, I realize vector multiplication is scary, but

227
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
it's not that scary.

228
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,040
Alright, that's it for today.

229
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,280
We'll start prepping for the final next week.

230
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,330
Ms. Reyes, we need to talk.

231
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:18,210
We're a family, aren't we?

232
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,330
Don't throw that penny out of the air.

233
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,930
It could kill someone.

234
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,010
Everyone's gonna die!

235
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,810
This dream is ruining my life.

236
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,230
Mine too.

237
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,610
Every night, Steph.

238
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,290
God, I'm not getting any sleep.

239
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,690
I'm sorry.

240
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,430
Um, can I tell you something?

241
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,950
Yeah, what's up?

242
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,690
So, the woman in my dream, her name

243
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,510
is Iris, right?

244
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,510
Okay.

245
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,010
That was my grandmother's name.

246
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,490
I, uh, I think I'm dreaming about her.

247
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,790
Are you serious?

248
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,310
Yeah.

249
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,890
The thing is, I never even met her.

250
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,830
I don't even know if she's alive.

251
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,010
Okay, well, either go home and find out

252
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,850
about Grandma and hope that stops the dreams,

253
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,350
or stay here and die in your sleep,

254
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:16,970
for real.

255
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,490
Because I will murder you.

256
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,510
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,010
Yeah, yeah, okay.

258
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,490
Love you!

259
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,450
Love you too.

260
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,370
Go home.

261
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,910
Yeah.

262
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,630
Quietly.

263
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,830
Steph.

264
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,780
Hey, there she is.

265
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,540
Hey, Dad.

266
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,720
Welcome home, sweetie.

267
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,260
So glad you're here.

268
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,720
Yeah, me too.

269
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
I miss you so much.

270
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,480
I know.

271
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,600
So great to see you.

272
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,880
Thank you, thank you.

273
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,820
Take that for you.

274
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,060
Hey, sorry.

275
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,740
Charlie took your room a while ago, and

276
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,240
my files are in his room, so I

277
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
made up the pull-out for you.

278
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,340
Is that okay?

279
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah, yeah, no, that sounds totally fine.

280
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,560
Hey, do we still have that box of

281
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,540
Mom's old stuff?

282
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,840
It had some photos, like an address book,

283
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
phone numbers in it.

284
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,020
Why do you want that?

285
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,340
It's not a big deal.

286
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,040
I just thought I saw it lying around

287
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,580
here somewhere.

288
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,200
Stephanie, what's going on?

289
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,200
Okay, this is going to sound really, really

290
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,820
weird, but I just need to find Mom's

291
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,460
mom, Iris.

292
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Uh...

293
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,260
Okay, yeah, that is weird.

294
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,180
And you know, I got rid of those

295
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,160
boxes years ago, after Mom left.

296
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh, hi, Charlie.

297
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,320
Hey.

298
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,740
Um, hi, Steph.

299
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,740
How are you?

300
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,020
It's so nice to see you.

301
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Yeah, sure.

302
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,720
Uh, you going to the Cousins?

303
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,360
Whoa, now?

304
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,240
Hook, your sister, just got home.

305
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,040
I thought we could...

306
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,620
Actually, you know what?

307
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,760
I can drive you.

308
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,460
I was wanting to see them anyways.

309
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,720
It's fine.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Hey, if you're going to see your cousins,

311
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,980
please don't talk about Iris to Uncle Howard.

312
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah.

313
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,120
Yeah, no problem.

314
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,800
All right.

315
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,500
Bye, love you.

316
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,320
Love you, too.

317
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,420
Charlie?

318
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,560
Charlie, can you just take these out, please?

319
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,560
I'm trying to talk to you.

320
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,380
What's your problem?

321
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,160
What?

322
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,560
I just...

323
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,580
You haven't said anything this entire time.

324
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,160
Well...

325
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,620
Steph, why are you here?

326
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,840
I mean, you only come home for holidays.

327
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,900
Okay, I have to tell you something, but

328
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,620
you have to promise not to tell Dad.

329
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,220
Are you pregnant?

330
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,780
No, I'm not pregnant, Charlie.

331
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,340
I don't know.

332
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,600
Why would you even...

333
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,400
That's not...

334
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,220
I mean, you're in college.

335
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,020
Can you just promise me you won't tell

336
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,280
Dad?

337
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,820
Why would I tell Dad?

338
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,200
It's serious, Charlie.

339
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,000
All right.

340
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,230
Okay.

341
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,990
I am on academic probation.

342
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,970
Whoa.

343
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,150
Stop laughing.

344
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,510
If I don't get my grades up...

345
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,170
This is kind of a big moment for

346
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,330
me.

347
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,130
This is kind of funny.

348
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,690
Straight A's.

349
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,130
You're a class president.

350
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,020
Miss Valedictorian.

351
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:48,810
Charlie, it's not funny.

352
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,730
If I don't get my grades up, I

353
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,150
will lose my scholarship.

354
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,030
Oh.

355
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,510
I buzzed.

356
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:55,790
Sorry.

357
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,370
What happened?

358
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,950
I can't sleep.

359
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,050
Every time I close my eyes, I have

360
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,810
this same recurring nightmare about Iris, our grandmother.

361
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,950
I don't...

362
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,630
I mean, it has to mean something.

363
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,910
I don't know.

364
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,570
I dream weird things.

365
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,030
I dreamed a hot dog ate me last

366
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,290
night.

367
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,850
What?

368
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,050
Like, the hot dog was eating me.

369
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:22,890
Okay.

370
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,170
Dude, can you just do something?

371
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,350
Dude, calm down.

372
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,530
Just move a little bit.

373
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,490
I can't pause over these online messages.

374
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,870
I have to look under these.

375
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,710
Can you do me a kindness?

376
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,230
Fuck off.

377
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,130
Do you remember what happened last time?

378
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,290
It's a ranked match.

379
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:39,830
It's a ranked match.

380
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,250
What's going on?

381
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,710
I can't find Paco.

382
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,910
Dude, again?

383
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,270
Who's Paco?

384
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,110
No way.

385
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,870
Hey, hey, cuz.

386
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,010
Oh my gosh.

387
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,830
Hey, can you help us look?

388
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,750
And just watch your feet when you're stepping.

389
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,010
Yeah, yeah, sure.

390
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,770
I just...

391
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,170
I gotta talk to your dad first.

392
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,630
The fuck are you doing home?

393
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,310
Oh, dude, she's fucking out of school.

394
00:24:59,410 --> 00:24:59,670
Hey.

395
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,630
Welcome to the club.

396
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,410
Eric, dude, have you looked anywhere?

397
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,590
Paco's not upstairs.

398
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,190
Oh, but look who's down here.

399
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,210
Hi, Julia.

400
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:08,770
Oh my gosh.

401
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,230
How you been?

402
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:09,810
Charlie.

403
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,290
Jules.

404
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,630
There's my little Romeo.

405
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,250
So, wait, how did the promposal with Jenny

406
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:15,670
go?

407
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,630
Dude, she said yes.

408
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,610
Oh my God.

409
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,950
Stop.

410
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,770
Okay, wait.

411
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,230
Who's, uh, who's Jenny?

412
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,630
Oh, he met her in Junior Lifeguards.

413
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,030
Junior Lifeguards.

414
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,710
Charlie, I didn't...

415
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,190
I didn't know you were doing Junior Lifeguards.

416
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,410
Okay.

417
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,710
So what are you gonna wear?

418
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,410
Uh, just gonna keep it simple.

419
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,530
No black blazer.

420
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:33,770
Okay.

421
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,410
But...

422
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,130
But with, like, a fun bow.

424
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,050
I like it.

425
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,470
Stop!

426
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,510
Stephanie!

427
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,130
Oh my gosh.

428
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,610
Hi, honey.

429
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,410
Hi, I'm Brenda.

430
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,430
How long are you here for?

431
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,250
Uh, not long.

432
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,770
Uh, is, is Uncle Howard around?

433
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,370
Yeah, yeah, he's out back.

434
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,810
I'll get him.

435
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,190
Howard!

436
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,390
Stephanie's here.

437
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,790
Come in.

438
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,370
Great.

439
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,070
You look a little tired.

440
00:25:59,230 --> 00:25:59,930
Is everything okay?

441
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,370
Oh.

442
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:00,850
Stephanie!

443
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,530
Look at you!

444
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,610
Come here, come here.

445
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,510
Oh, sweetie.

446
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,450
Oh, it's so good to see you.

447
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,610
Hey, are you hungry?

448
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,490
I was just gonna make some lunch.

449
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,670
Uh, no, actually.

450
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,830
Uh, I came here because I wanted to

451
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,650
talk to you about your mother, Iris.

452
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,870
I know you don't like to talk about

453
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,010
her.

454
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:16,670
There's not much to tell.

455
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,050
Hey, kids, come on, lunch!

456
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,350
It's just that I've been, I've been having

457
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,070
this recurring nightmare about her.

458
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,010
Oh, honey, it's probably just stress.

459
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,690
You should try melatonin.

460
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,310
Okay, but the weird thing is, I've been

461
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,310
dreaming about a real place from, from 50

462
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,830
years ago.

463
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,690
It was, like, a restaurant called The Skyview.

464
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,070
You know what it is?

465
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,290
Did, did Iris tell you about it?

466
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,950
Uh, what did, what did she say?

467
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,290
Did, did she say anything?

468
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,970
Um, maybe, maybe if I could talk to

469
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,110
her...

470
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,610
Talk to who?

471
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,070
Uh, Steph is dreaming about Grandma Iris.

472
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,410
Psycho granny?

473
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,610
I thought she was dead.

474
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,290
Well, she's dead to us.

475
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,350
Stephie, Iris Campbell is a very deeply disturbed

476
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,670
woman.

477
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,450
End of story.

478
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,510
Look, if I could just talk to her,

479
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,350
then, then maybe, maybe I can get these

480
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,870
dreams to stop.

481
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,790
Steph, just drop it.

482
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,890
I don't get it.

483
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,450
What, what happened that was so bad?

484
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,690
For one thing, she's the reason that your

485
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,490
mother's so screwed up.

486
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:07,930
What?

487
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,030
Look, I just don't want to talk about

488
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,710
this anymore, okay?

489
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,910
Uncle Howard, please, I just need to know.

490
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:20,350
Look, Stephie, after our father died, Iris just

491
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,570
snapped.

492
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,530
She, she wouldn't let us go to school.

493
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,410
She locked us inside the house.

494
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,690
She obsessed about all the horrific ways we

495
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,150
could die.

496
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,330
And eventually it got so bad, I mean

497
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,130
so bad, that the state came in and

498
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,950
they took your mother and I away from

499
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,110
her.

500
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,190
But it didn't end there.

501
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,950
She, she tracked us all through foster care.

502
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,750
And when the kids were born, she started

503
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,770
sending us these horrible letters that were full

504
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,670
of obituaries and these disturbing pictures of dead

505
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,050
bodies.

506
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,990
We had to move, so she couldn't contact

507
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,550
us anymore.

508
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,150
So, uh, do you still have any of

509
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,170
those letters, though?

510
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:03,890
I...

511
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,290
Stephie, listen to me.

512
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,210
That woman is a sick and dangerous person.

513
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,330
And for your well-being and your safety,

514
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,630
stay the hell away from her.

515
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,330
I believe you.

516
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,140
I found Paco.

517
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,140
Thank God.

518
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,780
I'm sure he'd love to be in the

519
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,740
living room right now.

520
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,840
No way.

521
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,560
Come on, guys, let's go.

522
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,200
How did he even get in there?

523
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,960
I need you to help me.

524
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,120
You heard your uncle.

525
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,660
Just let it go.

526
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Just let it go.

527
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
You don't understand.

528
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,740
My whole life is falling apart because of

529
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,200
this dream.

530
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,600
And not only that, I feel like, I

531
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,740
feel like I'm losing my mind.

532
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,740
Please, you are the only person who can

533
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,080
help me.

534
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,860
Howard would never forgive me if I put

535
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,700
you in touch with Iris.

536
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,760
Please.

537
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,830
Whatever you do, do not look in the

538
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,630
bottom drawer of the dining room cabinet.

539
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,880
Hi, um, I'm here to see Iris Campbell.

540
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
Did you not see the signs?

541
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,980
Uh, uh, yeah, yes, I did, but...

542
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,380
Then get the fuck out of here.

543
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,140
No visitors.

544
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm your granddaughter.

545
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,620
Stephanie.

546
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,300
Empty your pockets.

547
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,440
Phone, keys, everything.

548
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,540
Well, I'm not dangerous.

549
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,840
It's not you I'm afraid of.

550
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,870
Uh...

551
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:33,470
Come in slowly.

552
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,260
Shut the door.

553
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,260
Quick, quick, quick.

554
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,480
Don't move.

555
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,860
Oh, my God.

556
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,620
It really is you.

557
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,020
I can see your mother in you.

558
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,080
Hi, I'm Stephanie.

559
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,800
Stop, stop, don't.

560
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,120
Move.

561
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,220
Not until I tell you.

562
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,740
Trying to trick me, aren't you?

563
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,360
Getting me to let my guard down.

564
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,880
I...

565
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,600
Sit.

566
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,820
Sit.

567
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,220
Okay, um, sit.

568
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,580
That's it.

569
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,340
So, how is Darlene?

570
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,860
Your mom, okay?

571
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,620
Oh, uh, no, I don't know.

572
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
She, uh, she left when I was ten,

573
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,700
so we don't see her anymore.

574
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,560
Oh.

575
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,420
But you saw my letters, that's why you're

576
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,120
here, right?

577
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,240
No.

578
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,060
Um, I'm actually here because I've been dreaming

579
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,020
about the sky view.

580
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh.

581
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:14,940
Yeah.

582
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,240
Yeah, every single night for the past two

583
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,980
months, it's the same dream.

584
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,600
In it, you're on a date, but then

585
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,900
the dance floor breaks, and then there's an

586
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,800
explosion, and then you...

587
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,380
Fall and die.

588
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:27,740
Yeah.

589
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,580
Yeah, everyone dies.

590
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,860
It wasn't just your dream.

591
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,540
It was my premonition.

592
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,640
Years ago, at the sky view, I got

593
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,480
a glimpse into the future and saw what

594
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,820
death was about to do.

595
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,680
I was gonna do this at dinner, but

596
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,540
seeing as we have this view...

597
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,280
Hey, don't throw that penny.

598
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,380
You could kill somebody.

599
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,120
Oh, I'm so sorry, of course.

600
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,240
These past two years have been absolutely magical,

601
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,580
and that's all because of you.

602
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,580
No, no, no, no, I...

603
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
This isn't right, I...

604
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,320
Is that a no?

605
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,180
Everyone's going to die.

606
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,940
The whole building is going to come down

607
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,240
and...

608
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,160
Are you serious?

609
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,760
The penny.

610
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,640
Iris?

611
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,240
Give me that.

612
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,480
What the hell, lady?

613
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,400
Give it to me!

614
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,060
What are you doing?

615
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

616
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,720
Iris?

617
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,180
Don't play!

618
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,880
Don't play!

619
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,780
Everyone needs to get off the dance floor!

620
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,320
The glass is about to break!

621
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
Everyone needs to get off now!

622
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,500
Wait, no!

623
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,180
Get off the dance floor!

624
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,620
Iris!

625
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,720
You need to get off!

626
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,420
Get off!

627
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,600
I saved a lot of lives that night.

628
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,680
Lives that were never meant to be saved.

629
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,120
They closed the restaurant after that.

630
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,240
Said it needed additional renovations.

631
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,680
But it never reopened.

632
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,740
Eventually they tore it down.

633
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,440
Wait, so you stopped the disaster?

634
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,140
Yes.

635
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,220
But death doesn't like it when you fuck

636
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,120
with his plans.

637
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,360
So over the years he came back.

638
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,140
And he killed everyone who was there that

639
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,440
night.

640
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,280
Including my Paul.

641
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,940
Wait, wait a minute.

642
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,840
Did you...

644
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,740
Did you say death came back?

645
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,760
He's a relentless son of a bitch.

646
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,400
Won't stop till he finishes the job.

647
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,400
But I taught myself how to see him

648
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,820
coming.

649
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,500
To anticipate his every move.

650
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,560
Been keeping him at bay for years now.

651
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,240
And now he's got me.

652
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,000
Cancer.

653
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,420
Believe that shit?

654
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,500
Sorry.

655
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,340
Got the diagnosis two months ago.

656
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,300
Wait, that's when I started having my dream.

657
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:11,940
See?

658
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,760
It's a sign.

659
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,320
Okay, but why am I dreaming about what

660
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,820
you saw?

661
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,400
Maybe my cancer passed my premonition on to

662
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,500
you.

663
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,060
Maybe it's fate's demented sense of humor.

664
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,900
Who the hell knows?

665
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,200
What matters is that when the universe speaks

666
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,240
you pay attention.

667
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,310
I see you, you fuck.

668
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,830
Um...

669
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,610
Who...

670
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,430
who are you talking to?

671
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,270
Death.

672
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,110
He thinks I'm distracted because you're here.

673
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,330
I have to teach you everything in this

674
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:55,590
book.

675
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,170
It'll take some time to learn the basics.

676
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,750
So you'll need to stay here.

677
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,450
Stay here?

678
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,930
The outside world is too dangerous.

679
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,010
I haven't stepped out there in 20 years.

680
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,030
In here, we can be safe.

681
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,150
Oh.

682
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,770
See that?

683
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,990
Yeah.

684
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,770
This is all my research.

685
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,090
My life's work.

686
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,570
Look, I'm...

687
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:15,930
I'm sorry.

688
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,230
I...

689
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,870
I can't...

690
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,170
I can't stay here.

691
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,630
I...

692
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,110
I have to get back to school.

693
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,230
But, you know, I'll...

694
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,390
I'll come back and I'll visit.

695
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:22,910
No!

696
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,910
I'm sick!

697
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,410
I won't be alive that long.

698
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,570
You can't leave.

699
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,750
Don't you see?

700
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,730
Death is coming for our family.

701
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,210
Uh...

702
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,409
You don't believe me?

703
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,850
No, I...

704
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,090
I'm...

705
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,850
I think...

706
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,789
I think I made a mistake.

707
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,770
I think it...

708
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,330
I think it was probably just...

709
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:42,890
a dream.

710
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,650
No, wait!

711
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,270
At least take the book!

712
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,070
Look, I'm sorry.

713
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,230
I shouldn't have come here.

714
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,870
This book is a lifeline.

715
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,510
It will show you everything you need to

716
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,890
know to keep our family safe.

717
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,390
You still don't believe me?

718
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,970
Step back.

719
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:32,710
What?

720
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:33,290
Why?

721
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,870
Seeing is believing.

722
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:38,550
No!

723
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,150
No!

724
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,870
Hey, Steph.

725
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,030
Her face really exploded right in front of

726
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,130
you.

727
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:02,830
Is that like...

728
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,590
I'm...

729
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,550
Just leave her alone.

730
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,570
It's my bad, Steph.

731
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,230
I'm just curious.

732
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,670
Hey.

733
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,330
How are you holding up?

734
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:12,870
Yeah.

735
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,570
I'm sorry Uncle helped.

736
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,350
You were right about Iris.

737
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,450
I never...

738
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,430
I never should have went there.

739
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,990
Honey, there's no need to apologize.

740
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,430
I'm so sorry you had to go through

741
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,690
that.

742
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,790
She said something to me before she died.

743
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,590
She said death was coming for our family.

744
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,610
That's...

745
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,810
That's crazy, right?

746
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,490
Oh my God.

747
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,070
I can't believe it.

748
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,070
I emailed her.

749
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,510
I just didn't think she'd show up.

750
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,390
Come on.

751
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,840
You know what?

752
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,000
Um...

753
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Demo?

754
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,840
Yeah.

755
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,160
Darlene!

756
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,720
Wow.

757
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,800
Um...

758
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,840
I can come back.

759
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,660
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

760
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,400
Come on.

761
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,860
Get down here.

762
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,200
Come here.

763
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,540
Think she'll come to the barbecue?

764
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,580
Steph, hey.

765
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,380
If she's going to Uncle Howard's house, then

766
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,840
I'm not.

767
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,040
You can get a ride with Dad.

768
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,060
You're not even going to talk to her?

769
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,320
Come on.

770
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,180
You don't remember her like I do.

771
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,840
Just give her a chance.

772
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,260
Why?

773
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,080
Charlie, she abandoned us and now she rolls

774
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,460
in here?

775
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,260
After all these years and wants to act

776
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,060
like nothing happened?

777
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,950
Because he would do that.

778
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,750
Right?

779
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,430
Wait, what?

780
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:50,810
Nothing.

781
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:51,390
No.

782
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,270
No.

783
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,430
What's that supposed to mean?

784
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,470
I tried calling you so many times.

785
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,190
And nothing.

786
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,370
Same with Julia.

787
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,390
You used to be best friends.

788
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,330
You don't even talk anymore.

789
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:00,830
Okay.

790
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,990
Well, I'm sorry.

791
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,530
I...

792
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,350
I've just been distracted the last couple of

793
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,570
months because of this nightmare.

794
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,490
What about before that?

795
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,890
It's been like this ever since you left.

796
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,710
You're mad at Mom, but you haven't been

797
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,210
around either.

798
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,270
I'm not like her.

799
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:15,890
Okay?

800
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,730
I'm not crazy.

801
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,740
Yeah, you're right.

802
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,520
You're not crazy.

803
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,040
You just don't care.

804
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,690
All right.

805
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:55,480
Now you got it.

806
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,340
Watch out for splinters.

807
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,880
Hey, there she is.

808
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,100
Hey.

809
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,000
Come here.

810
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,820
I'm so glad you made it.

811
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,300
You know, I didn't think you were actually

812
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:20,700
going to come.

813
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,260
Thank you for inviting me.

814
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,180
Of course.

815
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:23,640
Come on in.

816
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,640
Hey, everybody.

817
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,100
Come on.

818
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,620
Come on over.

819
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,320
I made cookies.

820
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,200
That's great.

821
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,180
Can I try one?

822
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,060
Yes, of course.

823
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,460
Does this have peanut butter?

824
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,480
Yeah.

825
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,500
Are you trying to kill my brother?

826
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,080
Oh, my God.

827
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,680
Bobby's allergic.

828
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,460
Yeah.

829
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,720
I totally forgot.

830
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,560
I'm so sorry.

831
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,640
The important thing is that you're here.

832
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,160
So, uh, Bobby Bartender.

833
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,540
Drinks.

834
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,420
Drinks all around.

835
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,100
Family.

836
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,080
You don't get to pick the one you

837
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,320
get.

838
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,420
You just got to love the one that

839
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,780
you got.

840
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,660
Now, uh, our mother, she lived alone until

841
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,420
the day that she died.

842
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,520
And her death should be a reminder to

843
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,500
all of us to enjoy life and spend

844
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,880
the time that we have together.

845
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,320
Because we're not going to get any back.

846
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,060
I love you guys.

847
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,540
Aww.

848
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,900
Cheers to that.

849
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,420
Cheers.

850
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:36,760
Cheers.

851
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:37,660
Cheers.

852
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:39,900
Mmm.

853
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:42,920
This is strong.

854
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,680
What did you put in there?

855
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,580
Julia?

856
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,440
Oh, cool.

857
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,200
Are you all right?

858
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,940
Oh, my God.

859
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,100
There's a bug in there.

860
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,840
Your royalty.

861
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:16,570
Ah.

862
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:16,950
You are?

863
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,100
Actually, yeah.

864
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,260
I'm turning in my crowning job.

865
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,040
That's great.

866
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,360
Yeah.

867
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,380
Charlie!

868
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,120
Get up here!

869
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:51,710
Whoa!

870
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:55,930
Eric.

871
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,730
Ma.

872
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:57,850
Grill's ready.

873
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,490
Mind if I join you?

874
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:17,410
Have a seat.

875
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,050
Take the load off.

876
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:21,910
Oh, yeah.

877
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:23,329
There we go.

878
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:26,109
It's great, the setup you've got here.

879
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,270
Well, I wanted the kids to have a

880
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,850
happy childhood.

881
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:31,790
Unlike some people I know.

882
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,470
You're not talking about us, are you?

883
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:34,870
Oh, no.

884
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:35,950
We had a great childhood.

885
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,350
Mm-hmm.

886
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,590
I mean, look at me.

887
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,850
I turned out fabulous.

888
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:44,570
Yep.

889
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,070
Oh.

890
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,160
Howard.

891
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:51,580
What?

892
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:51,780
Come on.

893
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,400
What is that?

894
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,260
It looks like a house key.

895
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,320
I mean...

896
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,080
Come on.

897
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,220
You know we got the spare room.

898
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,240
And it's got to be better than bouncing

899
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,140
around trailer parks.

900
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,870
I don't think this is a good idea.

901
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,870
It's never too late for a second chance.

902
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,830
I'm sorry.

903
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,100
They're better off without me.

904
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:26,490
Pick up.

905
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,270
Pick up, come on.

906
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,470
You're onto me, right?

907
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,790
You're onto me.

908
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,630
You're onto me.

909
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:47,300
Come show us your back

910
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:47,480
flip.

911
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:47,640
What?

912
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,400
No, no, no.

913
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,840
Yeah, come on, Uncle Howard.

914
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,840
Come on, Howard.

915
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,440
Howard.

916
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,280
Howard.

917
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,320
Howard.

918
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,180
Howard.

919
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:55,860
Up him up.

920
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,700
Up him up.

921
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,340
There you go.

922
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,180
All right.

923
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,660
Here we go.

924
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,140
Watch out.

925
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:09,780
Wait.

926
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,160
Stop.

927
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:20,710
Oh.

928
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,910
Nice catch, Auntie.

929
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,250
All right.

930
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:23,850
All right.

931
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,330
Here we go.

932
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:24,870
Okay, Dad.

933
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:25,610
Let's do it.

934
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,430
Stay away from that edge.

935
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,270
Come on, Uncle Howard.

936
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,970
Here we go.

937
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,710
Just like college.

938
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,690
That was nice.

939
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,050
Careful, Howard.

940
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,520
I better get it out of there.

941
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,820
Hey, Stephanie.

942
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,600
You made it.

943
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,000
Stephanie.

944
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,780
I'm glad you decided to come.

945
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,760
Now the whole family's here.

946
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,220
Yeah.

947
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:17,780
I'm okay.

948
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,080
I'm all right.

949
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,220
Oh, good.

950
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm okay.

951
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,360
It's okay.

952
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,180
It's all right.

953
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,040
Oh, God!

954
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:43,630
The former things are passed away.

955
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,690
Neither shall there be mourning nor pain, and

956
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,950
he shall wipe away every tear from their

957
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,090
eyes, and death shall be no more.

958
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,630
Hey.

959
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,530
Where's all this stuff?

960
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,100
I found these papers in Iris' book.

961
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,240
They are obituaries and articles for the people

962
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,700
who were at the Skyview on the night

963
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,000
that Iris had her premonition.

964
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,720
Each one of these people went on to

965
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,340
die in some weird and messed up way,

966
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,580
and not only that, they all died in

967
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,340
the same order as Iris' premonition.

968
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,320
Hundreds of people were supposed to die that

969
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,740
night, but Iris stopped the disaster.

970
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,720
So death came back for them one by

971
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:25,980
one.

972
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,080
Since there were so many survivors, it took

973
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,040
years for death to get to all of

974
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,060
them, but eventually it got to Iris.

975
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,320
She was the last to die in the

976
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,760
premonition.

977
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,640
It was her and a little boy, but

978
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,400
she was prepared.

979
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,520
She single-handedly held off death for decades.

980
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,320
Stephanie, sweetie, I don't think this is the

981
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,500
appropriate time for this.

982
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,840
Yeah, I mean, none of this even has

983
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,220
anything to do with us, right?

984
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,500
Why are we even here?

985
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:56,940
No, that's it.

986
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,360
It has everything to do with us.

987
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,860
I mean, because death took so long to

988
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,680
make its way through the survivors, these people

989
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,880
went on to have families, families that they

990
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,780
never should have had.

991
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,160
So death took them too.

992
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,960
Don't you see this?

993
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,720
Death is coming for us because we were

994
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,100
never supposed to exist.

995
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,760
Okay, so why everybody in this room is

996
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,000
on death's hit list?

997
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,020
Bobby, Stock, that's what she's saying.

998
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,120
No, no, no.

999
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,760
Dad and Aunt Brenda are safe because they're

1000
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,900
not part of Iris' bloodline.

1001
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,060
Okay, following the pattern, death makes its way

1002
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,540
down each branch by age.

1003
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,240
So because Uncle Howard was the oldest, it'll

1004
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,460
start with his family first, meaning Eric, you're

1005
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,800
next.

1006
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,760
Go fuck yourself.

1007
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,380
Then it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.

1008
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,380
Then it'll come for our branch, starting with

1009
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,840
Darlene, then me, then Charlie.

1010
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280
Charlie, you buying this?

1011
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,440
I don't know.

1012
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,440
This is so messed up.

1013
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,240
I mean, you're turning our dad's death into

1014
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,100
some kind of fucked-up conspiracy theory.

1015
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,240
What is wrong with you?

1016
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,320
It's not, it's not a conspiracy theory.

1018
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,240
Fab, enough.

1019
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:06,960
We're all gonna die.

1020
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,280
Stop.

1021
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,400
I can't listen to this for one more

1022
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,820
minute.

1023
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,820
That crazy woman's nonsense has caused enough pain

1024
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,140
and suffering for this family.

1025
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,680
Hang on.

1026
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,880
Aunt Brenda, please, just listen.

1027
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,340
Leave me alone.

1028
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,780
Okay, in Iris' book, she mentions somebody who

1029
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,340
cheated death and survived.

1030
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,740
Stephanie.

1031
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,220
Come on.

1032
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,840
Eric, no, wait.

1033
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,420
I'm worried about you.

1034
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,320
Stop it.

1035
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,100
Let me take care of this.

1036
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,740
Come on, Bobby.

1037
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,140
Brenda.

1038
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,660
Let's go.

1039
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,080
No, no, no, you can't.

1040
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,800
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1041
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,040
Please.

1042
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,900
You believe me, right?

1043
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,160
I'm sorry.

1044
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,020
Julian, look, I love you.

1045
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,540
But sometimes I really hate you.

1046
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,600
I know how convincing all of this can

1047
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:06,880
be.

1048
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,060
But it's not real.

1049
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,200
How can you say that?

1050
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,440
I know Iris taught you all of this.

1051
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,120
Don't let my mom's beliefs derail your life

1052
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,220
the same way they did mine.

1053
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,070
Thank you so much for that advice, but

1054
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,550
I really don't need a mom anymore.

1055
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,830
Wide open, wide.

1056
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,450
All right, good.

1057
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,150
Just gonna pinch, all right?

1058
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:39,490
You ready?

1059
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,010
Five, four, three.

1060
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,590
Two.

1061
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,230
Good job.

1062
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:51,630
You're gonna hit the club.

1063
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:52,930
I need you to lock up.

1064
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,790
And don't touch any of my liquor.

1065
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,790
No, no, you didn't say anything about locking

1066
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,010
up.

1067
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:57,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,310
You didn't say shit about closing, dude.

1069
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,310
Yeah, cry me a river.

1070
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,450
I hope you burn in hell.

1071
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,170
You believe that shit?

1072
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,410
My old man just died.

1073
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,610
I come in as a favorite of that

1074
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,610
asshole, and now he wants me to lock

1075
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:11,850
up.

1076
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,610
You know what that is?

1077
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,030
Mm-hmm.

1078
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,170
You know what that is?

1079
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:15,730
Mm-hmm.

1080
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,670
It's inconsiderate.

1081
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,370
Anyway, you're all done.

1082
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:18,850
Mm-hmm.

1083
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,950
Thank you.

1084
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,610
Of course, hey, five-star review, yeah?

1085
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,430
Like and subscribe and all the things.

1086
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:54,740
No, I can't forget this

1087
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,000
evening Or your face as you were leaving

1088
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
But I guess that's just the way the

1089
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,660
story goes And now it's only fair That

1090
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:59,660
I should let you know You should forget

1091
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,260
this evening Or your face as you were

1092
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:12,640

goddammit.

1094

Or your sorrow Yes, it should hold you

1095
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,440
Ow.

1096
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,330
Ow, ow.

1097
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:37,910
Oh, fuck.

1098
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:40,910
Oh.

1099
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,230
Ow.

1100
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:44,130
Ow.

1101
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,050
Come on.

1102
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:52,850
No.

1103
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,970
Okay.

1104
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,260
Ow!

1105
01:00:07,665 --> 01:00:08,316
Shit!

1106
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:26,237
Shit!

1107
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:29,780
Ow!

1108
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:48,714
Charlie, wake up.

1109
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:50,240
Charlie, wake...

1110
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,560
Charlie, wake up!

1111
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,600
I've been trying to call Eric all night.

1112
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,820
He's not answering me.

1113
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,740
I don't know where he is.

1114
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,840
I'm worried.

1115
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,380
I'm sure he's fine.

1116
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,020
Well, have you heard from him?

1117
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,240
I'm going over there.

1118
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,380
I need to check on him.

1119
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,280
You're coming too, Charlie.

1120
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,660
He's going to voicemail.

1121
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,860
Is that him?

1122
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,060
My friend just said the tattoo parlor burned

1123
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,640
down last night.

1124
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,400
What?

1125
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:25,900
Steph!

1126
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,180
Steph!

1127
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:28,860
Ow!

1128
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,340
Oh, what?

1129
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,200
You're trying to kill me?

1130
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,220
Eric?

1131
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,920
Uh, yeah, no, of course it's you.

1132
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,080
Dude!

1133
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,040
We heard about the fire.

1134
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,780
We thought you were dead.

1135
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,540
I'm fine.

1136
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,540
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1137
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,440
I was so worried about you.

1138
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,160
Yeah, a firefighter said I was lucky as

1139
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,700
fuck that I was wearing that leather jacket.

1140
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,820
It barely got burned.

1141
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,160
I'm wearing my favorite jacket, though.

1142
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:53,960
What is this?

1143
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,120
Oh, yeah, check it out.

1144
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
I got branded.

1145
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,680
Sick, right?

1146
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,000
You like it?

1147
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,520
You said you were asleep.

1148
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,940
No, you were blowing up my phone like

1149
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,760
a goddamn stalker.

1150
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,400
What'd you want me to do?

1151
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,280
Yeah, I don't get it.

1152
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:05,860
You should be dead.

1153
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,940
Right, yeah, yeah.

1154
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,120
Or, you know, maybe...

1155
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,120
Maybe death's not actually coming for our family.

1156
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,520
Because that would be fucking crazy.

1157
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,420
Jesus shit!

1158
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,720
Or maybe I'm invincible.

1159
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,060
Eric?

1160
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,480
Eric!

1161
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,660
Yeah?

1162
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,360
Eric, wait.

1163
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,040
Stop.

1164
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,880
Just wait, okay?

1165
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,880
Just because death didn't kill you last night

1166
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,820
doesn't mean that you're safe.

1167
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,320
Stay away from that tree trimmer!

1168
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,660
Ooh.

1169
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:40,760
Ooh.

1170
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,220
Gonna move on its own, Steph?

1171
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,220
Is that what it's gonna do?

1172
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:45,900
It could fall.

1173
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,200
And stay away from these kids.

1174
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,300
I'll take my chances.

1175
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,100
Steph, how is a couple kids with a

1176
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,020
soccer ball gonna kill him?

1177
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,760
I mean, I don't know.

1178
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,860
The trimmer could fall and hit the leaf

1179
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,260
blower guy, which causes him to blow stuff

1180
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,340
into the kid's eyes and then kick the

1181
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,000
ball into his face.

1182
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1183
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,060
Soccer ball into my face?

1184
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,600
That does sound deadly.

1185
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,080
I should be more careful.

1186
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,020
Hey.

1187
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:18,940
What's up?

1188
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,760
What happened to you?

1189
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,980
Charbroiled by death, apparently.

1190
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,920
She came.

1191
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,480
That was really bad.

1192
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,220
Oh, wait.

1193
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,120
Let me see that.

1194
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,000
Eric, just stay away from the truck.

1195
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:29,860
Oh, what?

1196
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,300
This truck?

1197
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:30,640
Stop.

1198
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:31,740
Oh, my God.

1199
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,420
Please.

1200
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,040
This truck right here?

1201
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,980
But it's such a beautiful truck.

1202
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,080
Stop.

1203
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,220
Stop.

1204
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:36,800
Don't touch it.

1205
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,780
Eric, get away.

1206
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,040
Stop.

1207
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,420
You like that?

1208
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,420
Can you just...

1209
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,960
Oh, my God.

1210
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,140
Oh.

1211
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,320
Uh-oh.

1212
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,980
Oh, Eric's tempted death again.

1213
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,220
What's gonna happen?

1214
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:50,700
What?

1215
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,400
Stop doing that.

1216
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,260
What's gonna happen?

1217
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,160
Nothing at all.

1218
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,760
How about that?

1219
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,480
Look, I'm just trying to help you, okay?

1220
01:03:59,860 --> 01:03:59,960
Try less.

1221
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,240
Try less.

1222
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:01,600
Yeah.

1223
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,960
Honestly, we're so done with your garbage.

1224
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,260
Can you please...

1225
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,980
For the 1,500th time, no one gives

1226
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,480
a shit about your stupid little death curse,

1227
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:09,740
okay?

1228
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,860
So take a hint and leave us alone

1229
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,740
because death's not coming for our family.

1230
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:19,560
Julia!

1231
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:24,920
Julia!

1232
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,060
Julia!

1233
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:26,720
Julia!

1234
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:50,420
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger Stand

1235
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,380
a little taller Doesn't mean I'm lonely when

1236
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,500
I'm alone What doesn't kill you makes a

1237
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:09,400
fighter Put the fever high Julia!

1238
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,260
No!

1239
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,140
Give me your hand!

1240
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,000
I got you!

1241
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,620
Don't worry, you're not next!

1242
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,480
Whoa, whoa!

1243
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,660
Hey, stop!

1244
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,240
Stop!

1245
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:19,780
Stop!

1246
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,820
My sister's in the back!

1247
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,540
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1248
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,140
We should have believed you, Steph.

1249
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,410
No, I...

1250
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,130
I screwed up the order and now Julia's

1251
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:05,290
dead.

1252
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,410
It's my fault.

1253
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,070
Guys, look.

1254
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,150
What happened was traumatic and awful, but it's

1255
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,130
not anybody's fault.

1256
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,030
It's my fault.

1257
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,190
Mom, it's not your fault.

1258
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,450
It is my fault.

1259
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,130
Stephanie, you were only wrong about the order

1260
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,850
because there was something you didn't know.

1261
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,730
Eric isn't Howard's biological son.

1262
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,690
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

1263
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:43,610
And Stephanie, I didn't believe you, so I

1264
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,430
didn't say anything to you, and now my

1265
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,290
little girl's dead.

1266
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,090
Well, I don't understand.

1267
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:47,970
Were you having an affair?

1268
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,090
Your father and I were having such a

1269
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,770
hard time, but it was good because I

1270
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,270
got you.

1271
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:55,310
I got you out of it.

1272
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:55,690
Who's been a real dad, then?

1273
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,450
Who's been a real dad?

1274
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:59,110
It doesn't matter because Howard loved you so,

1275
01:06:59,410 --> 01:06:59,750
so much.

1276
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,270
Who is it?

1277
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:01,730
Who?

1278
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,450
Who's been a real dad?

1279
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,070
Jerry Fenbury.

1280
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,710
Oh, Jerry Fenbury?

1281
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:12,850
Yes.

1282
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,690
Oh, shit.

1283
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,090
No, no, no, no.

1284
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,490
Jerry fucking Fenbury?

1285
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,610
You don't know what we've gone through.

1286
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,510
Oh, God.

1287
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:21,850
What, is this why you always wanted to

1288
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:22,610
play catch?

1289
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,970
Oh, my God.

1290
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,260
Okay.

1291
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,160
All right, so that means that if it's

1292
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,180
going in the right order, that I'm next,

1293
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,460
right?

1294
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,160
You gotta help me, Steph.

1295
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,580
Mommy, I don't think that I can.

1296
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,500
I mean, I thought I did, but I

1297
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,620
don't...

1298
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,920
No, but you can.

1299
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,480
I mean, you predicted exactly what was gonna

1300
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:58,800
happen.

1301
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,980
You just got the order wrong because you

1302
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,320
didn't have all the information, Charlie.

1303
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,840
What do you mean, predicted?

1304
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,600
She saw everything.

1305
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,000
The trimmer, the blower, the soccer ball.

1306
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,980
Like, it was like there were pieces to

1307
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,440
a puzzle and she just had to put

1308
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,300
them together, you know what I mean?

1309
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:15,960
Is that true?

1310
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,220
Darlene, please, do not encourage this.

1311
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,840
Marty, I mean...

1312
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,720
I mean, it's everything in Iris' book.

1313
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,000
It's like an equation.

1314
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:27,920
It's math.

1315
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,720
Stephanie, if you can see how all of

1316
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,280
this fits together, we might have a chance.

1317
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:32,700
Stop.

1318
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:33,840
Just stop.

1319
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:37,620
You devastated this family when you walked out,

1320
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,539
but we've been okay without you.

1321
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,340
I'm begging you not to traumatize our kids

1322
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,039
anymore.

1323
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,180
It's real this time.

1324
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,340
I'm going for a walk.

1325
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,500
I need some air.

1326
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,040
I can appreciate that.

1327
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,500
Our family is clearly gonna need some counseling

1328
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,940
in the future, but can we focus on

1329
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,860
the fact that we're all about to die?

1330
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:08,520
Right?

1331
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,680
I mean...

1332
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,600
I mean, Steph, didn't you say that Iris

1333
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,740
knew someone that cheated death or something?

1334
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,100
Yeah, yeah, um...

1335
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,120
In here, somewhere, it says...

1336
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,180
that, uh, right here, J.B. found someone

1337
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,440
who survived, but it doesn't say anything about

1338
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,440
who this J.B. was or...

1339
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:31,720
Wait a minute.

1340
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,440
I know that name.

1341
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,240
My mom used to write me letters, and

1342
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,500
she sometimes would talk about a friend of

1343
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,460
hers named J.B. who worked at a

1344
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,020
hospital.

1345
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,040
Hospital?

1346
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,200
Um, um, something, uh, Something River Hospital.

1347
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,900
Uh, Deep River.

1348
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,780
Uh, Peace River Hospital.

1349
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,660
Uh, Clear...

1350
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:50,960
Hope...

1351
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,620
Hope River?

1352
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,460
That's it.

1353
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,560
Shit, it's like an hour away.

1354
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,540
I'm going.

1355
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,140
I'm gonna go find him and talk to

1356
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,000
him myself while I'm coming with you.

1357
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,700
It's okay.

1358
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,320
Let's go.

1360
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,160
Bobby, I...

1361
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,380
What?

1362
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,660
You need to stay here with your mom.

1363
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,120
It's safer.

1364
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,460
Yeah, fuck that.

1365
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,040
Are you kidding me?

1366
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,300
I'm not staying here by myself.

1367
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,400
Well, it's too dangerous on the road for

1368
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:14,520
you.

1369
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:14,940
You can't...

1370
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,680
No, I read Gammy's death book, okay?

1371
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,140
All right?

1372
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,640
I mean, there's, like, a thousand house-related

1373
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,800
deaths in that thing.

1374
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,980
Man, you trip down the stairs, fall...

1375
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,960
down a toilet or something.

1376
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,300
I don't...

1377
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,200
I don't know, but I'm not...

1378
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,660
I'm not...

1379
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,860
No way, I'm not staying here.

1380
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,100
Hang on, hang on.

1381
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,280
Hey, okay.

1382
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:33,820
Okay, okay.

1383
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,540
Too fast.

1384
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,000
Okay, okay.

1385
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:35,600
We'll go slow.

1386
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:35,960
We'll go slow.

1387
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,080
I'm gonna go open up the truck.

1388
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:38,060
Charlie, check the back.

1389
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:38,420
Got it.

1390
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,530
Be careful.

1391
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:45,630
The steps are slippery sometimes.

1392
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:46,910
Oy!

1393
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,890
Any of you fuckers do a nut check?

1394
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:52,470
Excuse me?

1395
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,910
You made cookies in that thing with peanut

1396
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,410
butter in them just a few days ago.

1397
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,170
This poor bastard so much as even touches

1398
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:00,990
a nut, his throat is gonna close up

1399
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,950
tight and...

1400
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,350
You understand.

1401
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,070
Where's the peanut butter?

1402
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,910
Cabinet above the sink.

1403
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:06,810
Thank you.

1404
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,230
I'm so sorry, Bobby.

1405
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,090
I just...

1406
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,690
Hey, okay.

1407
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,600
All clear.

1408
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:18,820
Thank you.

1409
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,540
You're a good brother, Eric.

1410
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,300
Nut check.

1411
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:22,640
What?

1412
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:24,600
Let's go.

1413
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,440
It was good.

1414
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,380
I get it.

1415
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,080
Let's go.

1416
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:30,620
Come on.

1417
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,300
It's only gonna get worse.

1418
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:33,840
Damn it.

1419
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:34,540
Wait.

1420
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,560
I'm coming with you, bro.

1421
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,020
Someone's gotta protect you.

1422
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,210
Dad's calling again.

1423
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,410
Tell him we just went for a ride

1424
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:50,730
with Mom.

1425
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,050
He's not gonna believe that.

1426
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:53,530
At least it'll buy us some time.

1427
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:54,930
Go ahead.

1428
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:59,190
Death doesn't get us your dead will.

1429
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,620
I always keep them where I can see

1430
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:13,860
them.

1431
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,340
I mean, you could've just had the real

1432
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,400
thing, but it's okay.

1433
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,620
Not everyone wants to be a mom.

1434
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,480
Is that what you think?

1435
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,720
That I didn't want to be your mom?

1436
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,440
Look, I was raised by a woman who

1437
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,740
taught me to see death everywhere.

1438
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,620
I thought I could put it behind me,

1439
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,220
but then when I had you and your

1440
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,580
brother, all I could see were a hundred

1441
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,220
different ways that you and Charlie could die.

1442
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,880
I didn't want you to leave the house.

1443
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,440
I would freak out on you guys over

1444
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,560
nothing.

1445
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,960
One day, I looked at your face, and

1446
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,520
I saw the same scared little girl that

1447
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,220
I was growing up, and I knew that

1448
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,880
if I stayed, I was gonna ruin your

1449
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,140
life.

1450
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,280
I have no idea if I did the

1451
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:04,640
right thing.

1452
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,920
But I'm here for you now.

1453
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,110
It's okay.

1454
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,570
I'm right behind you.

1455
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,460
Hey, thanks, G-Buddy.

1456
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,300
We got you.

1457
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,880
The front desk is this way.

1458
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,830
Oh.

1459
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:57,210
Hi.

1460
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,730
Um...

1461
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:03,170
We're looking for J.B. And who are

1462
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:03,410
you?

1463
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,410
The front desk told us we could find

1464
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:06,830
him down here.

1465
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:07,250
Is that you?

1466
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,490
That would be me.

1467
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,260
William John Bloodworth.

1468
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,700
But my friends call me J.B. I've

1469
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,620
been waiting for you, Stephanie.

1470
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,060
Charlie.

1471
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,200
Darlene.

1472
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,920
But no Howard.

1473
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,940
No Julia.

1474
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,100
So, which one of you is next?

1475
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,200
I...

1476
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,150
I was sorry to hear about Iris.

1477
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:45,890
She was a special woman.

1478
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,110
How did you know her?

1479
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,810
She saved my life.

1480
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,070
When?

1481
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,330
At the Skyview.

1482
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,520
My mother brought me with her to work

1483
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,180
that night.

1484
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,120
J.B., honey, I told you, you gotta

1485
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,880
stay back there while I'm on stage.

1486
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,940
I wasn't supposed to be there.

1487
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,080
Except, of course, to die.

1488
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,360
Stop playing!

1489
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,560
Stop playing!

1490
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,720
Everyone needs to get off the dance floor!

1491
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,560
The class is about to break!

1492
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,060
Everyone needs to get off now!

1493
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,360
Wait!

1494
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:25,860
Iris!

1495
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,760
You were the last to die.

1496
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,660
You were the little boy.

1497
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,160
Correct.

1498
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,000
So all that time, she wasn't...

1499
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,220
She wasn't just protecting our family.

1500
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,560
She was protecting you, too.

1501
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,940
Years later, she tracked me down.

1502
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,080
Helped me see the truth.

1503
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,320
We traded ideas.

1504
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,720
I helped her fortify her cabin.

1505
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,660
We became friends.

1506
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,240
I even helped her get the best medical

1507
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,860
care I could, considering her condition.

1508
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,740
Iris said that you found somebody who stopped

1509
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,540
death and survived.

1510
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,220
Yes.

1511
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,880
And how do we do that?

1512
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,860
There are only two ways.

1513
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,700
By killing or by dying.

1514
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,760
If you take a life, you get the

1515
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,540
time that person had left.

1516
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:24,000
What?

1517
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,420
No.

1518
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,320
I'm not gonna kill someone.

1519
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,860
Maybe we should let the guy finish.

1520
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,980
Then to truly break the cycle, you have

1521
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,620
to die.

1522
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,740
What does that mean?

1523
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,320
A long time ago, a young woman named

1524
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,060
Kimberly Corman found herself on death's list, just

1525
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,040
like you.

1526
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,920
And when her turn finally came, she died.

1527
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,300
Flatlined.

1528
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,780
But her doctor managed to bring her back,

1529
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,560
and that broke the chain.

1530
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:54,800
All right, then.

1531
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,280
We'll do that.

1532
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,580
What are you talking about?

1533
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,040
Why didn't Iris try that?

1534
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,140
It's risky.

1535
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,599
And if you fuck with death and lose,

1536
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:08,020
things can get very messy.

1537
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,550
Hang on, hang on.

1538
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:13,030
Okay, wait.

1539
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,630
No, there has to be another way.

1540
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:17,310
Please, you have to help us.

1541
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,869
For years, people have been coming to me

1542
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:20,490
for advice.

1543
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,329
Well, I'm tired.

1544
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,270
I'm done with all that.

1545
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,710
And now I'm sick just like Iris.

1546
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,770
There's no running this time.

1547
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,430
Fact is, you're all gonna die.

1548
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:37,110
And after that, I will, too.

1549
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,650
Now that my old friend is gone, I'm

1550
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,170
retiring.

1551
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,050
So what?

1552
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,290
You're just gonna leave us here?

1553
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,370
We need your help.

1554
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,890
Where are you going?

1555
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,790
I intend to enjoy the time I have

1556
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,250
left.

1557
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,890
And I suggest that you do the same.

1558
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,990
Life is precious.

1559
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,170
Enjoy every single second.

1560
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,570
You never know when.

1561
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Good luck.

1562
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,560
That's fantastic.

1563
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,300
No.

1564
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,440
No, that can't be it.

1565
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:23,760
No.

1566
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,360
There has to be something here.

1567
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,020
There has to be another answer.

1568
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:29,480
Steph.

1569
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,720
Steph, he gave us an answer.

1570
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,560
Bobby's gotta die.

1571
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:35,620
Eric!

1572
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,620
Are you fucking insane?

1573
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,480
We're not killing Bobby.

1574
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1575
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,420
Am I the only guy that just listened

1576
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:40,940
to that dude?

1577
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,420
There's only one way.

1578
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,880
We kill Bobby, we resuscitate him, and then,

1579
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,540
boom, you're all off death's list.

1580
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,080
Congratulations.

1581
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,980
There has to be something else, right?

1582
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,480
I mean, there has to be another solution,

1583
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,220
right, Steph?

1584
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:52,840
No.

1585
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,980
No, there's nothing else we can do, okay?

1586
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,560
It's over.

1587
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,680
We'll be done.

1588
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,460
Stephen, listen to me.

1589
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,300
You gotta trust me on this one, okay?

1590
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,640
She's giving up on you.

1591
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,940
I'm not going to.

1592
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,340
Look, Iris found a way to hold death

1593
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,300
off for decades.

1594
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,720
So will we.

1595
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:13,880
I trust that guy.

1596
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,040
You trust that guy?

1597
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:15,680
He was funny.

1598
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,420
That just went there.

1599
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,560
He was just oddly charismatic, and you know

1600
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,600
that as well as I do.

1601
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,400
Uh...

1602
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,260
Eric and Bobby are gone.

1603
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:36,800
Shit.

1604
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:37,880
Shit!

1605
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,700
I don't think I like this.

1606
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,340
Hey, dude, we're in a hospital.

1607
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:42,780
Remember?

1608
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:43,780
There's doctors everywhere.

1609
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,100
We kill you, they bring you back.

1610
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,140
Everybody's safe.

1611
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,540
We're heroes.

1612
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,500
That is literally the opposite of keeping me

1613
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:50,600
safe.

1614
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,160
What's the alternative, huh?

1615
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,280
You want to kill someone and take the

1616
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,080
time they have left?

1617
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:56,580
How?

1618
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,960
How would you even know how many years

1619
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,360
they have?

1620
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,460
No.

1621
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:06,900
No.

1622
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,320
No.

1623
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,400
Well, I mean, no.

1624
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:11,780
No.

1625
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,440
Of course not.

1626
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:12,840
Of course not.

1627
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:13,500
We would do that, right?

1628
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,340
No, we would never.

1629
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,380
Don't touch those babies.

1630
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,380
Look, bottom line...

1631
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,260
Flatlining's your best option.

1632
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,500
What do you have to lose?

1633
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,020
Okay, all right.

1634
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,060
How would we even do that?

1635
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,300
Well, see, I got an idea.

1636
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,540
But it's a little nuts.

1637
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,280
Your allergy is deadly, right?

1638
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,440
Yeah.

1639
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:47,460
Well...

1640
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,100
Oh, hey, dude, wait.

1641
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,720
No, look, all right?

1642
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,160
If I'm going out, it's not gonna be

1643
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,120
on those...

1644
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:56,380
What is it?

1645
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,180
Insulted bitches, all right?

1646
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,100
Give me those.

1647
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,480
Nice choice.

1648
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,110
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1649
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:15,650
Come on.

1650
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:16,490
Hey.

1651
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:17,630
All right.

1652
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,310
Come on.

1653
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,230
You know, maybe this is a sign, so

1654
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:20,630
we can just...

1655
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,630
Ow.

1656
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:23,130
Okay.

1657
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,530
Hey, dude, maybe we can just bail now.

1658
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,810
I'm not giving up.

1659
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,790
Can you help?

1660
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:33,610
It's all right.

1661
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:34,290
We work here.

1662
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,750
Maintenance.

1663
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,330
It's fine.

1664
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:37,510
Put your headphones back on.

1665
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,610
Dude, it's gonna fall.

1666
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:39,670
It's gonna fall.

1667
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:42,570
It's falling.

1668
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,250
Get it out.

1669
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:44,030
Hold it.

1670
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:44,870
It's gonna fall.

1671
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:51,810
Easy work.

1672
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:54,890
Now what?

1673
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:56,690
Come with me.

1674
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:57,190
Come with me.

1675
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:00,770
It's...

1676
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,650
Hey, hang here.

1677
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,370
I gotta get something.

1678
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:04,970
What?

1679
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:05,850
Don't move.

1680
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,430
What are you talking about?

1681
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:55,590
No, that's...

1682
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,450
That's cool.

1683
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,550
I searched the bathrooms.

1684
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:58,830
They weren't in the RV?

1685
01:22:59,150 --> 01:22:59,450
No.

1686
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:01,170
Look, if Eric was trying to kill Bobby,

1687
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:01,990
where would they be?

1688
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,750
I don't know, but there's a million ways

1689
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,470
to die in a hospital.

1690
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:05,390
Can I help you?

1691
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:06,870
Excuse me?

1692
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,130
No, uh, just came to see my Nana.

1693
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:12,630
Hi, Gladys.

1694
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:13,150
Here.

1695
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:16,210
Lovely day today.

1696
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:17,930
Got much time left?

1697
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,270
I think so.

1698
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:26,190
All metallic belongings and devices that could interact

1699
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,890
with the MRI's powerful magnet.

1700
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,510
Hey, uh, dude, Charlie's trying to call.

1701
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:32,970
I don't care about that.

1702
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,030
Okay, come on.

1703
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:34,430
Sit down.

1704
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:35,390
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1705
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:35,670
What the hell?

1706
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:36,270
No.

1707
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,070
Sit in that.

1708
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,070
I've got a great idea.

1709
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:38,410
Okay.

1710
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:39,970
There's an ER down the hall, so as

1711
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,210
soon as you flatline, boom.

1712
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,310
I'm gonna wheel your ass down, man.

1713
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,270
They're gonna bring you right back.

1714
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,390
Hey, where's your EpiPen?

1715
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,490
Uh, it's right here.

1716
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:46,910
Give it to me.

1717
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:48,130
Why?

1718
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:51,390
What is that?

1719
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:51,710
Dude.

1720
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:52,070
Give it.

1721
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,650
Give it.

1722
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:53,510
Dude, listen.

1723
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:55,050
The whole idea is that you have to

1724
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:55,390
die.

1725
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:56,110
Remember?

1726
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,290
This keeps you alive.

1727
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:57,770
Now sit.

1728
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,430
Dude, we need to hurry.

1729
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:00,990
Come on, go.

1730
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:01,310
All right.

1731
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,510
All right, eat up.

1732
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,710
Hey, man.

1733
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:12,970
The plan's great, but, you know, if it

1734
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,650
doesn't work out...

1735
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,950
It's going to work, Bobby.

1736
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:15,450
Yeah.

1737
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,670
Yeah, but, you know, just in case, and

1738
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,550
I die for real...

1739
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,190
Will you just, um...

1740
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:27,930
Will you look after Paco?

1741
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:29,990
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1742
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:30,650
I'll look after him.

1743
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,010
Dude, I'm just saying.

1744
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,590
I mean, the turtles live to be like

1745
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:34,030
100 years old, and...

1746
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:34,650
I'm not gonna take time for commitment.

1747
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,110
Look at me.

1748
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:35,810
Look at me.

1749
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,330
Brother, I'm not gonna take care of Paco

1750
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:40,010
because you are gonna be okay.

1751
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:41,810
Me and you, we are going to fix

1752
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,890
things for everyone right now.

1753
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,910
I promise you, I'm not gonna let you

1754
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:52,190
die.

1755
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,790
Technically, I'm gonna let you die, but then

1756
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,330
I'm gonna bring you back.

1757
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,450
Dude, it's not funny.

1758
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:58,430
I'm just fucking with you.

1759
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,230
Come on.

1760
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:02,710
You got this.

1761
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,640
Oh, my God.

1762
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:34,800
What?

1763
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,720
It's really good.

1764
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,780
It's very good, I know.

1765
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,060
So what, okay, other than good, what are

1766
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:41,340
you feeling?

1767
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:45,410
Nothing.

1768
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:47,470
You gotta be kidding me.

1769
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,870
What, you're telling me you're not allergic anymore?

1770
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,670
I don't know, man.

1771
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:50,370
That's just perfect.

1772
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:51,770
My hair grew out of it.

1773
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,050
What grew out of it?

1774
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:53,730
Fuck.

1775
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,130
You know, I don't have a plan B

1776
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:56,670
exactly.

1777
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,190
Hey, you're doing it.

1778
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're doing it.

1779
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:04,390
Bobby, you're doing it.

1780
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,610
Hey, I'm here with you.

1781
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:07,950
I'm here with you.

1782
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,290
Hey, hey, I can't give you that.

1783
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:10,590
Hey.

1784
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:12,130
Bobby, Bobby.

1785
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,670
Hey.

1786
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:13,690
Hey.

1787
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:14,890
Please.

1788
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,510
Bobby, this is all part of the plan.

1789
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:18,410
Just calm down.

1790
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,090
Bobby, in the wheelchair.

1791
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,180
Try calling them again.

1792
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,160
This is the only way we can do

1793
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,300
this.

1794
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,340
No!

1795
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,180
No!

1796
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,900
No!

1797
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:48,300
Fuck!

1798
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,190
Run!

1799
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:16,710
Oh my God.

1800
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:17,930
Are you okay?

1801
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:19,310
Yeah.

1802
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:23,350
No!

1803
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,400
Why is Eric dead if he's not related

1804
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:53,820
to Iris?

1805
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,180
When you fuck with death, things get messy.

1806
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,500
We have to get out of here.

1807
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:11,660
It's not safe.

1808
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,200
Then go where?

1809
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,100
Nowhere is safe.

1810
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,840
Except Iris' cabin.

1811
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,000
She was able to survive there for decades.

1812
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,500
And then she got her face blown off.

1813
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,360
She only died because she left the cabin.

1814
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:34,220
Outside is dangerous, but inside is the safest

1815
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,120
place that there is.

1816
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,080
You're right.

1817
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,460
It's the only place where we have any

1818
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:41,940
advantage.

1819
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,080
So we just lock ourselves in a cabin

1820
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,700
forever?

1821
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,600
Not you.

1822
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,560
Me.

1823
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:58,400
Mom, you can't leave.

1824
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,515
We just got you back.

1825
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:03,330
If anybody's gonna live in that cabin, it's me.

1826
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,673
And as long as I am alive,

1827
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:07,930
death can't touch you.

1828
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:09,670
-Mom.
-Let me do this.

1829
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,592
He'll never let you get there on your own.

1830
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:13,470
But I can see him coming.

1831
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:16,230
We have to do this together.

1832
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,060
Okay.

1833
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:24,800
Okay.

1834
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:34,710
Let's go.

1835
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:58,970
You should drive.

1836
01:30:59,370 --> 01:30:59,770
Yeah.

1837
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:03,090
Holy shit.

1838
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:06,010
Look at this place.

1839
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,940
It's gonna be impossible to get through that

1840
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:14,160
gate.

1841
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,300
He's about to make a move.

1842
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:37,540
I don't know what it is.

1843
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,380
We need to get you inside now.

1844
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:42,500
Wait.

1845
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:43,700
Wait, what?

1846
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:21,510
Okay, let's get inside.

1847
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:24,150
Shit.

1848
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:28,670
What?

1849
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:36,380
I can help.

1850
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:38,080
Don't wait for me.

1851
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:38,860
Just get inside.

1852
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,840
Steph, if you get inside, I'll be safe.

1853
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:41,580
Go.

1854
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:42,400
Okay.

1855
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,000
Come on.

1856
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:35,690
Mom?

1857
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:43,920
Mom!

1858
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,280
Mom?

1859
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,960
Don't worry about me.

1860
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,960
Go save your sister.

1861
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,420
I'm gonna stay alive as long as-

1862
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,880
Oh my god.

1863
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,020
Are you okay?

1864
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,120
Just breathe.

1865
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,140
Breathe.

1866
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:20,100
Breathe.

1867
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,480
Charlie, what happened?

1868
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:28,900
You're okay.

1869
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,460
You died, and I brought you back.

1870
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,600
You brought me back.

1871
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,300
We're safe now.

1872
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,740
Mom?

1873
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,060
No.

1874
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:56,200
No.

1875
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,440
She saved us.

1876
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,580
Let's go home.

1877
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,140
All right, I'm ready.

1878
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,680
Well, there he is.

1879
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:05,200
Wow.

1880
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,180
Okay, Charlie.

1881
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,120
All right, give us a spin.

1882
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:08,760
Mm-hmm.

1883
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:10,960
Oh.

1884
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:11,880
Mm-hmm.

1885
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,600
You look really good.

1886
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,540
I have a great stylist.

1887
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,300
Come on, we'll be late.

1888
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,260
Where's Jenny?

1889
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,900
I think she's still inside getting ready.

1890
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,420
Here, let me fix this.

1891
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,140
I'm really happy you could be here for

1892
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,380
this.

1893
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,320
Me too.

1894
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:41,840
Oh.

1895
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:43,340
You okay?

1896
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:45,560
Yeah.

1897
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,580
Can I have one cookie, please?

1898
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:28,800
Charlie.

1899
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,200
Look, it's sharp.

1900
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,740
Thank you.

1901
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,460
Steph, I want you to meet Jenny's dad,

1902
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,040
Dr. Reddick.

1903
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:34,520
Hey.

1904
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:34,820
Hi.

1905
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,680
Nice to meet you.

1906
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,340
You too.

1907
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,300
We just adore Charlie.

1908
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,420
And I understand he's quite the lifesaver.

1909
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,020
Oh, yeah, you heard about that.

1910
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,480
He, uh, brought me back from the dead.

1911
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:48,620
Hmm?

1912
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,240
Yeah.

1913
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:51,920
What?

1914
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,420
Well, technically, you weren't dead.

1915
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,040
What?

1916
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,800
I mean, if you were unconscious and Charlie

1917
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,620
got you breathing again, then your heart didn't

1918
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:00,940
stop.

1919
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,700
But regardless, way to go, Charlie.

1920
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,120
So she wasn't dead?

1921
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,100
Exactly.

1922
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,920
She was lucky Charlie was there.

1923
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,400
Yep, everything happens for a reason.

1924
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:15,820
Jenny!

1925
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,420
Sweetie, you look like a million bucks.

1926
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,240
Oh my god, that was close.

1927
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:53,580
You okay?

1928
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,135
-Yeah.
-Oh.
