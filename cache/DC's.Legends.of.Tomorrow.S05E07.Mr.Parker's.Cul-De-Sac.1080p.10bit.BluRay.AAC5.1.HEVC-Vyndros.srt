10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,158
Hello?

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,410
Who's there?

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,704
I'm just gonna use my hand to block out
the sun's glare,

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,289
so I can see you...

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,917
You.

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,793
No!

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,086
No! It can't be you!

17
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,770
[Constantine] The Loom of Fate.

18
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,898
An ancient artifact that has the power
to change any person's life story

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,441
without wrecking the timeline.

20
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,817
Anyone's, like...

21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,319
Astra's.

22
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,696
And we give her a life
where her mum never died,

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,907
and where she never goes to Hell.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,326
If you think I'm helping you,
you're daft as a brush.

25
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,162
I destroyed that thing
for a bloody good reason, John-o.

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,080
Come on, Sara.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,165
You know this can solve
all of our problems.

28
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,583
It can erase all of the Encores.

29
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,377
Yeah, and make
all of our dreams come true.

30
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,964
John, I'm sorry,
but I'm with Charlie on this one.

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,300
That kind of cosmic power
doesn't belong in the hands of anyone.

32
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,802
Astra has made her choices, John.

33
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,512
It's not up to you to undo them.

34
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
Now, this...

35
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,475
will be the solution
to our Encore problem.

36
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,019
[Gideon] Captain Lance,
there is a new Encore detected

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,896
in Salvation, 1874.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,107
I love my Prognosticator.

39
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,858
All right, Legends,

40
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,861
grab your cowboy hats and leather straps

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,614
because we are going to...

42
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,866
Where is everyone?

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,619
I, uh, might have got
a bit sentimental on my deathbed

44
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,246
and encouraged Raymond to

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,872
carpe his diem.

46
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,708
Nice rock.

47
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,710
She'll love that.

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,796
And when she finds it...

49
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,466
- I'll pop the question.
-[doorbell rings]

50
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,804
She's here. She's really here.

51
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,055
[Ray] Oh, man.

52
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,641
It's really happening.

53
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,310
Our work here is done.

54
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,187
Our boy is all growns up.

55
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,953
Nora Darhk, welcome.

56
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,247
I will have the pleasure
of serving you this evening.

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,125
Thanks, Gare.

58
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,669
Whoa.

59
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,087
Wow, Ray.

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,883
You really went all out for date night.

61
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,093
[whispers] I thought
we were just having pizza.

62
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,472
Oh. I got a little inspired,
I guess. [chuckles]

63
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,140
Yeah. Yeah, well...

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,936
I see Pippa is still your charge.

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,523
Yes, until we figure out
her heart's deepest need. [chuckles]

Big talker, I see.

68
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,366
Defiling the library, I see.

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,577
Yeah, well, you know, I've quit smoking,
so, uh, I need a new habit.

70
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,245
- Doing some research?
- Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,207
I need to find the Loom of Fate
to save Astra,

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,126
but since Charlie
isn't making it easy for me,

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,587
I am doing it the hard way.

74
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,006
- Why not ask an historian?
-[chuckles]

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,967
All right then, Mr. Professor, tell me,
what do you know?

76
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,136
Well, when I was in grad school,

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,724
my professor showed me a diary
of an explorer named Ernest Shackleton.

78
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,143
Now, Shackleton
was obsessed with the Loom,

79
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,355
and he believed a piece of it
was buried under the South Pole.

80
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,275
So, if I'm to find the Loom,
I've got to search the South Pole.

81
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,028
Shackleton thought so.

82
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,613
Bloody hell.

83
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,156
Nice one, mate.

84
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,617
Don't worry, John.

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,161
We'll figure out another way
to help you and Astra.

86
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,707
That ought to cool his jets.

87
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,254
Hey, Mick.

88
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,215

Mick, get out here right now!

00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,856
What?

98
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,065
What is going on?

99
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,109
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

100
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,277
Oh, cute. You have a troll.

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,403
What's wrong with your face?

102
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,158
Zari, your mission is to help Mick.

103
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,076
Okay. I have so many makeover ideas.

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,786
With his troll problem.

Wait... Wait a second.

117
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,785
Did you just say "Director Sharpe"?

118
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,078
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,330
Gary, what year are you from?

120
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,458
The present. 2018.

121
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,876
Okay, listen.
I need you to tell us who did this,

122
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,628
and then immediately
courier back to the Bureau.

123
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,837
I can't.

124
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,465
He stole my Time Courier.

125
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,883
Who?

[doorbell rings]

127
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,145
Hi, Nora-doll.

128
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,105
Daddy's home.

129
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,692
Dad.

130
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:09,619
Oh, Nora-doll, I missed you so much.

131
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,455
This is amazing. How are you...

132
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,791
[voice wavers] You are an Encore.

133
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,501
Look, all I know is,
I'm up here right now,

134
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,504
as part of some
soul-harvesting pyramid scheme.

135
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,839
Honestly, I can't keep up
with these millennials

136
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,509
and all their newfangled
world-domination plans.

137
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,844
So, you're doing
the whole villain thing again.

138
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,388
Well, you... No, I mean...

139
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
Part of my parole agreement.

140
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,435
But after spending two years in Hell
worrying about my little girl,

141
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,188
I had to come and see you first.

142
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,690
But look at this place!

143
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,985
You must be a master sorceress by now.

144
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,278
Oh, yeah, yeah.

145
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,613
This is just a place where I hang my hat

146
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,407
and do my dark rituals.

147
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,033
"Dark rituals."

148
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,369
How did you find me? Blood magic?

149
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,912
Your Palmer Tech watch.

150
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,914
It still has location-sharing on.

151
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,166
Palmer Tech, right.

152
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,585
[Nora] Ray!

153
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,129
Sorry for the delay.
Gary seems to have run off.

154
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,463
My dad's here.

155
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,048
- What?
- My dad's here!

156
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,134
- Your dad's here?
- Shh!

157
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,635
Oh, man, Is he an Encore?

158
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,055
Oh, man. And Sara
just found herself a Hell Sword.

159
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,265
- Which means...
- She'll kill him.

160
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,017
- What do we do? What do we do?
- You have to leave.

161
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,976
- What about Pippa?
- Pippa.

162
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,977
- Pippa!
- Pippa.

163
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,894
You have to take her.

164
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,441
You have to keep her comfortable,
so that she doesn't summon me.

165
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,525
That's it. That's gonna work.

166
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,985
-[gasps] Thanks, Ray.
- Okay.

167

"Rebecca Silver knows as much about love

168

169
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,831
[sighs] Okay. Bad reviews,
they just come with celebrity.

170
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,250
You should have heard
what they said about my perfume

171
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,210
when it made people
bleed out their noses.

172
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,963
[grunts] He's gonna get more than
a bloody nose.

173
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,716
No. Don't stoop to his level.

174
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,304
Inside every troll is the heart of a fan
just dying for some attention.

175
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,641
And some swag.

176
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,059
One signed book,

177
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,895
and he'll be
a Rebecca Silver stan forever.

178
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,564
[Ray chuckles] Ta-da!

179
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,899
What's that?

180
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,736
Oh, this is a TV show
I used to watch when I was a kid.

181
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,572
It really helped me dig deep
and communicate my feelings better.

182
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,825
It's called <i>Mister Parker's Cul De Sac,</i>

183
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
and I think you're really gonna like it.

How about 20 bucks?

So? Bachelor party?

200
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,671
No. Nora's clad literally
came back from the dead

201
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,423
and ruined the evening.

Damien Darhk? [sighs]

203
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,760
Anyway, Nora said she can handle it,
and so, she's handling it.

204
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,679
But we can't let anyone interfere.

he is your future father-in-law.

207
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,101
You don't think we could talk Sara down?

208
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,979
When I see Damien Darhk,
I'm gonna kill him for good this time.

209
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,105
What about Nora?

210
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,232
Well, ideally, she never finds out.

211
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,692
Gideon, any hits?

212
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,737
[Gideon] Yes, Captain. In fact,
I'm detecting new Encore activity

213
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,697
at Constantine's home in 2020.

214
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,490
All right, let's do this discreetly.

215
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,326
Just us, no boys.
You know how sentimental they can get.

[Agent Sharpe] Yep.

217
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,289
You also received a call
from a Wild Dog while you were away.

218
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,040
Yep, got it. Thanks, Gideon.

Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

This is extremely pornographic.

Oh, look,
he's showing off your signature.

Okay. Change of tactic.

Scouring the metadata from his posts

invoking book club right now?

323
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
Yeah.

324
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,198
You get one of those.

325
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,367
You get one. Are you sure?

326
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,745
Ava, I am invoking book club...

327
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,414
to ask you to give me
one night with my dad.

328
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,793
And if he is a harmless,
normal man by the end of it...

329
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,588
you let him live.

330
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,598
- Where are you going, Captain Cold?
-[sighs]

331
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,141
Antarctica, of course.

332
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,309
Ugh. That place is the worst.

333
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,311
But I'm following up
on the lead that you...

334
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,024
Bloody shapeshifters.

335
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,693
What?

336
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,363
Charlie. She used your face
to send me on some dead-end trail.

337
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,116
Send me to Antarctica.

338
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,578
Freeze my bloody arse off!

339
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,290
No! I'm getting off
this gormless jam jar.

340
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,666
[sighs]

341
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,461
Since there's no one here
that can help me, I'll do it my way.

342
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,712
Alone.

343
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,425
[Sara] All right. I think I got
these stupid crostinis right.

344
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,551
How's the salad?

345
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,137
Uh, it just needs to be dressed,
and then there's the soup.

346
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,889
How many courses did Ray have planned?

347
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,433
By my count, five.
Six if you include cocktails.

348
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,812
Come on, Ray.
Nobody gets laid after six courses.

349
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,979
Gary, how's the potion coming along?

350
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,689
Don't rush me.
Everything has to be done precisely

351
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,607
or it will not work.

352
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,983
Okay. Are you talking entree...

353
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,360
It'll be done by dessert.

354
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,279
Then let's get this dinner started.

355
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,411
[cell phone vibrating]

356
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,503
Hello, you've reached the office
of Sara Lance. How can I help you?

357
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,422
Hello, Mr. Dog.
What is this in reference to?

358
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,008
- Mmm, cheers.
- Mmm.

359
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,512
-[Damien] Mmm.
-[Nora] Mmm.

360
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,721
Oh, more crostinis!

361
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,348
-[tray clatters]
-[Damien laughs]

362
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,976
These are delicious.

363
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,728
-[Constantine] Bloody hell. Gary!
-[Nora coughs]

364
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,155
Damien Darhk.

365
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
John Constantine.

366
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,162
You know, I don't think
we've actually ever met before,

367
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,414
seeing as you're still breathing.

368
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,791
But you have died before, though, right?

369
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,837
So, what's about to happen
should feel a little, uh...

370
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,088
familiar.

371
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,303
<i>Remitte istud.</i>

372
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,888
[grunts]

373
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,309
[chuckles]

374
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,477
That was an heirloom, you...

375
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,229
Stop it! Both of you.

376
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,939
This vagrant is trespassing.

377
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,150
This is my house, you plonker.

378
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,568
Your house? Nora, I thought--

379
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,819
Well...

380
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,657
technically, it is his house.

381
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,535
His name is on the title.

382
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,580
But, in practice...

383
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,750
it's our house.

384
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,339
Right, babe?

385
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,925
[mouths] Just go with it.

386
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,386
- Right, love. My love, that is...
-[Nora sighs]

387
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,640
Because we are indeed, uh, together.

388
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,807
Oh, Nora-doll.

389
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,101
Here, I thought you were all alone.

390
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,895
But now, I know

391
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,399
that you have a powerful
warlock in your life.

392
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,069
- Johnny C, you bring it in here.
-[both chuckle]

393
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,780
You rascal! [laughs]

394
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,408
<i>The thing about circles is
They never end</i>

395
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

396
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,956
Why does he keep changing his shoes?

397
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,750
Changing his shoes is a soothing ritual

398
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,086
which takes him
from one space to another.

399
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,255
Where's my fairy godmother?

400
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,131
She's busy with her father.

401
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,008
So, why are you here and not there?

402
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,510
She asked me to give them space,

403
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,054
and I am respecting her boundaries.

404
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,306
She's hiding you from her dad.

405
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,185
Mr. Parker says you can love
whoever you want to love

406
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,853
and to not be ashamed.

407
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:29,692
[chuckles] You don't have to quote
Season 8, Episode 15 to me.

408
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,029
Okay? But look,
she's not trying to hide--

409
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,825
[in sing-song voice]
Fairy godmother! Fairy godmother!

410
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,827
- Come here, right now!
- Shh!

411
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,912
[splutters]

412
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,915
Damn it, Ray! I said no summoning.

413
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,125
Do you have any idea how many plates

414
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,710
I'm spinning right now,
trying to keep my dad happy?

415
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,254
Many. But quick question.

416
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,339
Um, are you hiding me?

417
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,343
Of course I am, I am telling him
a thousand lies right now,

418
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,095
to make sure nobody gets killed.

419
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,933
Oh, well...
why not just tell him the truth?

420
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,643
Ooh! Oh!

421
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,353
"Why not just tell him the truth?"

422
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,524
Okay. Why don't I
just tell my megalomaniac dad

423
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,277
that his little girl is a slave
to the whims of children

424
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,486
and is schtupping an Eagle Scout?

425
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,281
That sounds amazing.

426
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,199
The longer you lie
about who you really are...

427
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,284
-[sighs]
-...the harder it's gonna be

428
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
when the truth finally comes out.

429
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,622
Listen, can you just
give me this one night?

430
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,916
Okay? Just help me out.

431
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,836
And save the guilt trip? Please.

432
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,338
- Okay?
- Of course.

433
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,673
- Okay? Good? Everything good?
- Of course.

434
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,092
[sighs] Okay. Great.

435
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>Good night, boys and girls.</i>

436
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,598
Do you need to change your shoes?

437
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,934
I think I do.

438
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,649
I named her Lita, after, uh...

439
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,194
Yeah. Lita Ford of The Runaways.

440
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,237
Sorry I never told you.

441
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,573
Actually, I looked you up
after I found out I was pregnant,

442
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,824
but you were in jail.

443
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,410
Again.

444
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,081
So, it, um...

445
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,251
It must have been challenging, uh,
raising a kid by yourself.

446
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,711
I made it work.

447
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,047
Sure, Lita would ask about her dad,
but whenever she did--

448
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,340
She would just say, you know,

449
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,509
"My standards were low
and his sperm count was high."

450
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,426
[sniffs]

451
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,470
- Oh, God.
- But, uh...

452
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,431
when I learned that
Rebecca Silver was actually him,

453
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,017
I guess I let it slip that we had
hooked up at our reunion.

454
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,397
Lita's a smart kid.
I guess she figured it out.

455
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,148
Yeah. My dad writes crappy novels.

456
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,651
- They're brilliant.
- Debatable.

457
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,404
Either way, I still hate you.

458
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,073
Lita, he.., he didn't know.

459
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,159
But I guess now that
the pussycat's out of the pouch,

460
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,078
guess you two
can get to know one another.

461
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,079
[Scoffs]

462
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,373
Sounds like fun.

463
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,296
No! What the hell are you doing?

464
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,256
We were never here.

465
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,094
[Constantine] True story, that.

466
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,138
[Damien] I never knew that...

467
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,390
[both chuckling]

468
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,767
Wine!

469
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,102
Ooh.

470
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,646
Good to see you two getting along.

471
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,565
Oh, we're just telling stories,
aren't we?

472
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,984
You know, I shouldn't be shocked
that you'd be drawn

473
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,653
to a fellow after your pop's
old line of work.

474
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,988
Oh, well, you know me, Dad.

475
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,906
I can't help
but keep the family business going.

476
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,907
That's my girl.

477
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,660
Not that I could ever live up
to a great collector

478
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,579
-of artifacts such as yourself.
- Mmm.

479
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,207
But sadly, some things
could never be found.

480
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,335
Take for instance, the Loom of Fate.

481
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,962
[clears throat]

482
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,464
I never did find that one.

483
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,216
That's because it was scattered
across the multi-verse.

484
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,011
Ah, well, it's all on one Earth now.

485
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,928
Ours.

486
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,929
[Damien] Mmm.

487
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:50,476
Intriguing. Still, you'd need a Fate
to put it all together and operate it.

488
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,022
Right. Sounds like there's no point
in even looking for it, right, John?

489
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,858
Yeah, especially with so many
exciting opportunities

490
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,234
to think about, right, babe?

491
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,321
Yep. Maybe not the time.

492
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,741
I'm sensing something juicy
bubbling with the help.

493
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,868
- Mmm, no, I don't...
-[bottle slams]

494
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,995
Is there trouble in paradise?

495

You know what?
It's none of your damn business.

496
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,126
Oh, sit and spill. Uncle Damien
wants to hear everything.

497
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,836
No, they don't have to--

498
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,962
You know what?

499
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,715
Someone forgot to tell their girlfriend

500
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,426
about a job offer they received
to work in Star City.

501
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,969
- Babe.
- Permanently.

502
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,518
I was going to talk to you about it
before it became permanent.

503
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,311
- So, you're actually considering it?
- Yes.

504
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,230
I don't... Okay, how is that supposed
to work with you there

505
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,482
and me, one of Nora's hench-people?

506
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,817
Sara, she's right. You know,

507
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,861
long-distance relationships
can be tough.

508
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:43,862
Thank you.

509
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,114
It wasn't going
to be a long-distance relationship.

510
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,200
I thought that we could go together.

511
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,952
This... This is why I always have

512
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,913
a no-fraternizing policy with my staff.

513
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,207
- Mmm. Next course, please.
-[Damien] Mmm.

514
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,629
The potion is now purple,
and therefore...

515
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,758
ready to de-power the supervillain.

516
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,640
So, let me get this straight.

517
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,101
You stood up for yourself,
and she shut you down?

518
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,605
She just.., doesn't think
that Damien would accept me.

519
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,316
But aren't you setting yourself up
for a lifetime of lies?

520
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,485
Will you have to lie
when Damien comes to visit?

521
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,612
Or when you guys have kids?

522
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,991
Because you know those babies are going
to have that beautiful Palmer jawline.

523
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,534
The Palmer jawline is a dominant gene.

524
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,994
Damn right.

525
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,789
- Am I rushing into this?
-[yells] Yes!

526
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,879
We couldn't say something
unless you said something. Ray...

527
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,134
It feels rushed.

528
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,428
She's embarrassed of you.

529
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,014
After you made the perfect dinner,
took a massage class,

530
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,682
and hid an engagement ring
in the mousse?

531
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,852
The ring is in the mousse!

532
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,855

saved room for dessert.

couldn't get any better,

the love of her life.

Did she say "no"?

No, I won't marry John,

570
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,008
because I can't lie to you anymore, Dad.

Oh, thank God.

Hi, Damien... Mr. Darhk.

00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:36,344
Since you're here, I was wondering
if I could get your blessing

00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,557
to have your
daughter's hand in marriage?

You deceived me, Nora-doll.

Your own father.

586

You tried to poison me.

642
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,898
Damien, what seems to be on your mind?

643
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,360
Well, you simpleton,
my child means everything to me,

644
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,862
and you've completely
corrupted her into this!

645
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,490
See, this is why I had to lie.
I knew you couldn't handle it

646
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,534
because emotionally, you're the child!

647
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,079
Well, I think this is gonna be
tougher than we thought, kids.

648
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,039
Why don't we travel
to the Land of Make 'Em Ups

649
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,667
with Gary,
the Unspeakable Train Abomination?

- Hello, Charlie.

00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,899
- Hey, Ava.
- Yeah, Sara?

658
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,777
Are you bloody kidding me?
Puppets? Again?

659
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,449
I wanted to say that I feel bad
that I made you feel bad.

660
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,410
Oh, well, maybe we should communicate.

661
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:15,040
I'm sorry I kept the job offer
in Puppet Star City a secret.

662
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,626
I was only considering it because I
thought you wanted to settle down.

663
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,545
Well, I used to want that,

664
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,839
but I've been having
a lot of fun on the ship.

665
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,798
Oh!

666
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,135
Then I'll tell Puppet Wild Dog
to shove it!

667
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,762
- Yay!
- Yay!

668
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,599
Maybe you can work out
your problem with communication.

669
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,808
Yeah!

670
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,561
You were gonna send me
to the South Pole, Charlie.

671
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,189
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

672
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,068
It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.

673
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,320
I smashed that thing,
so we could be free.

674
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,822
People could be free to rebel,
free to be weird.

675
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,159
Come on, Charlie. If you sensed
that the Loom was in one universe again,

676
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,661
what's to say
your sisters didn't feel it, too?

677
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,456
What's to stop them going after it,
and for the wrong reasons?

678
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,209
Listen, I will use
the Loom to help Astra,

679
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,254
and then I will help you destroy it,
forever this time.

680
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,548
Forever?

681
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,718
Deal?

682
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,180
Deal.

683
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,559
Yay for communication and cooperation!

684
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,811
Yay.

It's the Safe Space Sombrero.

Please make it stop.
Make it just stop. I am going to just--

[growls]

698

You've ruined her life.
Her life is absolutely in shambles

699
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,261
because of you and the idiot brigade
she hangs out with.

700
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:55,056
I mean, look at her. She is trapped
in this horrible fairy godmother job.

701
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,475
- Horrible job?
- Mmm-hmm.

702
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,938
You know what, Dad?

703
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,565
My life now...

704
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,860
that's not Ray's choice, it's mine.

705
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,779
I know you think
all magic should be self-serving,

706
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,947
but I like helping kids

707
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,658
because being raised by a demon cult
instead of my own father...

708
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,078
that wasn't my choice.

709
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,497
That was yours.

710
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,003
So, maybe working with kids
helps me cope with that.

711
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,005
And you're right.

712
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,299
I am not the Nora-doll you remember.

713

I like who I am...

and I'm never going back.

I've been an ass.

716

I've had this vision of this life
that would make you happy.

717
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,526
Obviously, I was wrong.

718
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,196
I just want you to be proud of me.

719
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,280
Proud?

I can't wait to marry you.

Right now. I'm off-duty. My dad's here.

His schedule's unpredictable.

So, let's.., let's do it.
Right now. Tonight.

I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
everything you've done for my daughter.

00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,617
Thank you, but, uh,
I haven't really done that much.

She's pretty incredible all on her own.

756

Yeah, but you make her happy.

757
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,626
That's something
that I ultimately failed at

758
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,420
when I was the main man in her life.

759
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,508
Well, you know, I... I think
you're being too hard on yourself.

I don't need a pep talk.

761
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,429
But I do need you
to do something for me.

762
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,682
I need you to support her.

763

Of course. Always.

00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,019
No, I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to say.

765
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,564
Nora's job is very important to her...

766
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,109
and she can't do it
on that silly little ship of yours.

767
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,862
Nora belongs in the real world...

768
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,573
and you belong together.

769

I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say here.

770

Do the right thing, son,
or I'll come back and get you.

- Ah, I'm only kidding.
- Okay. That's what I thought.

00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,205
She's better off without me.

776
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,290
She reached out to you for a reason.

777
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,506
She's an idiot. I'm an idiot.

778
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,467
She's a pain in the ass.
I'm a pain in the ass.

779
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,844
The fact that she's not
already in juvie is a miracle,

780
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,514
-and it proves one thing.
- What?

781
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,891
- I'm no good for her.
- Are you sure about that?

782
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,942
- You know what?
- Mmm?

783
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,654
You've inspired me
to forego this evil thing.

784
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,114
Maybe this old dog
can learn some new tricks.

785
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,909
So, you'll stick around for a bit?

786
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,329
Oh, I think it's time
both of us move on to the next chapter.

787
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,333
Promise you'll check in on me
once in a while?

788
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,459
Of course.

789
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,587
I'll never be far.

790
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,513
I love you, Nora-doll.

00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,058
I love you, Dad.

792
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,994
- Let's go.
- Okay.

793
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,375
[cheers]

794
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,264
Taking off already?

795
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,642
Oh, I hate prolonged goodbyes.

796
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,062
I'd rather slip out while everyone's
in there still having a good time.

797
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,064
Mmm. So, where are you going?

I was ordered to cause pain and misery,
and damn more souls to Hell.

800
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,908
But instead, you decided
to check in on your Nora-doll.

801
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,205
I just wanted to
make sure that my little girl's okay.

802
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,749
And she is.

803
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,667
Thanks to the help of you idiots.

804
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,714
Plus, Astra's going to recall me soon
to an eternity of torture.

805
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,384
I didn't want to bum my daughter out
with all of that on her wedding night.

806
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,145
I know you'll never forgive me.

807
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,814
To tell you the truth...

808
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,400
I won't, either.

809
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,863
