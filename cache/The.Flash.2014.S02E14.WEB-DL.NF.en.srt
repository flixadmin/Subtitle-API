You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.
Zoom's looking for you.

-Don't worry about me, Henry.

-(PANTS) Zoom took him.
-What?

23
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,286
We tracked down Deathstorm and Killer
Frost, met my doppelganger, Reverb.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,163
Super evil guy, super evil powers.

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,042
The three of them almost took down Barry
until Zoom showed up, killed Cisco-2,

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,836
killed Deathstorm for hurting a speedster,

27
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,964
but then he left Killer Frost alive
and then took off with Barry.

How are you still alive?

29
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,718
Looks like he cares even less about me
than you do, Harry.

30
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:38,097
No. No, Zoom doesn't do anything
by accident. Did he follow you here?

31
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,433
I've seen <i>Heat</i> like 50 times, okay?
I know how to shake a tail.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,352
He didn't follow me. But check this out.

33
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,020
I jacked these from my dead ringer.

34
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,231
I think we can tweak these puppies,
use them to find Zoom.

35
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,358
Damn, it.
Ramon, we don't have time for this.

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,818
Zoom is hunting us. Zoom is hunting us!

37
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,613
We need to make an alternate plan
because if we don't, Zoom is...

Stop thinking like that, okay?

we're gonna find Barry. I know we will.

00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,056
{\an8}I mean, the two of you
should be ashamed of yourselves.

46
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,517
{\an8}You can't just lock someone
in a room like this.

{\an8}How long was I in here for?

to tell right now.

is so I can kill you

And the only reason

make sure the extracellular matrix
stays intact

After your last encounter with Geomancer,
I ran some tests.

The Velocity-Seven is reacting
with the damaged cells in your body.

won't do the same thing.

You disagree?

I think that he's saved a lot of people
in this city.

00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,322
Okay, uh, what if I could get you

153
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,535
an exclusive with the meta-human
that fought Geomancer?

154
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,370
This other Flash?

155
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,997
What? You're friends with him, too?

156
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,252
Just, um, (SIGHS) give me a little time.

157
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,673
Fine. But if it's the same
as the other crap that you wrote,

158
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,508
I'm gonna run something
about how the Flash

159
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,885
may not be the hero we all dreamed he was.

160
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,141

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

162
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,104
Iris. Hey, Iris.

163
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,692
-Barry, where were you last night?
-(SIGHS) Oh, my God.

164
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,403
My father died yesterday,
and you never even came home.

165
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,031
I know. I know, I heard. I'm so, so sorry.

166
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,742
What? You heard? You were there, Barry.

167
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,619
I actually was not there.

168
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,789
(STUTTERS) Yeah, okay.
Okay, look, come to my lab.

169
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,874
Just come up to my lab.
I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

170
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,209
I'm gonna explain it.

171
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,213
So (SIGHS) the Barry
from yesterday was not you.

172
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,551
(SCOFFS) No. No, look, I know that this is

173
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,012
hard to believe, but I mean,
it is just like that sci-fi series,

174
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,931
<i>Commander Carl:
Space Marshal of the Galaxy,</i>

175
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,059
where Carl gets sucked into a black hole
and ends up on another planet

176
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:25,481
that he thinks is Earth, but really
it's Earth of another universe.

177
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,570
Have you guys not seen... Oh, it's a
seminal episode. You should check it out.

178
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,198
So that's why you weren't wearing
your wedding ring yesterday.

179
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,910
-Well...
-And that kiss was so...

180
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,038
-I'm sorry, he got frisky with you?
-(SCOFFS)

181
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,751
No, no, no. Okay, I'm gonna have to find
this guy and give him a piece of my mind.

182
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,043
Well, don't give him too much.

183
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,087
Your husband tells us
you've been tracking Zoom.

184
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,007
-Yeah. I've been trying to. Why?
-We need to find his lair.

185
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,342
-"Lair"?
-He's a bad guy, I'm calling it a lair.

186
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,053
Zoom is looking for you.
Why are you going after him?

187
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,266
Zoom has my daughter and our Barry,
and we need to rescue them both.

188
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:05,021
Look, I wanna find Zoom just as much as
anybody, but no one can track him.

189
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,315
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

190
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,777
would be a meta that's worked with him.

191
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,320
A meta like Killer Frost?

192
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:18,450
Yeah, maybe, but Zoom kept her alive
yesterday because she always obeys him.

193
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,162
There's no way
that she's gonna tell you where he is.

194
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,413
I'm not so sure about that.

195
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,792
If she loved Deathstorm
as much as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

196
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,128
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

197
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,340
Look, finding her is gonna be just as hard
as finding Zoom.

198
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,970
But if anyone can do it,

199
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,973
my husband can.

200
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,519
Right. Yes, I can actually.

201
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,813
Um...

202
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,480
All right.

203
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,691
(SCATTING)

204
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,320
Okay, well, looks like Patty Spivot
was the CSI tech

205
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:57,657
<i>on most of the Killer Frost cases.
She's pretty thorough, so...</i>

206
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,991
What's that?

207
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,494
Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data
collected from numerous crime scenes.

208
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,083
DNA trace movements, facial recognition,
temperature fluctuations specific to her.

209
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,003
My algorithm compiles all the data
and gives us an approximate location.

210
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,672
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom of course.

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,843
-He's too fast, never leaves a trace.
-That's good.

212
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,637
ALLEN: <i>Okay. Looks like the best bet's
the woodlands.</i>

213
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,515
-Best CSI in Central City.
-No.

214
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,810
-You know where that is, right?
-Yeah. Let's go.

215
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,855
Wait, I'm going with you guys.
You're gonna need some help.

216
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,522
-Okay.
-Iris.

217
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,944
Barry, Zoom and his followers
are the reason that my father is dead.

218
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,572
If I can stop him from killing
anyone else, I'm gonna try.

219
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,035
-Okay, then I'm coming, too.
-HARRISON AND CISCO: No.

220
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,328
No.

221
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,165
Barry, this is not what you do.

222
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,418
I know that, but...

223
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,048
I also know Joseph didn't like me
too much, but he was my father-in-law.

224
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,177
If you're going, I am coming with you.

225
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,102
All right. You can come,
but you stay out of our way.

226
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:10,729
Okay.

227
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,278
BARRY: <i>That's not Morse code.</i>

228
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,700
I know he's trying to tell us something.
We just have to find the pattern.

229
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,002
There's no pattern, Barry.

230
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,966
You know your dad,

231
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,595
<i>who I'm pretty sure is one of the smartest
people to live on either of our Earths,</i>

232
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,434
told me the only person smarter than him
was you.

233
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,146
He said that?

234
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,609
If that's true, we work together,

235
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,446
I know we can figure this out.

236
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,784
Worth a shot?

237
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,082
Okay.

238
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,259
Well, he never goes past five.

239
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,635
What?

240
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,389
He never goes past five knocks
without pausing, right? Listen.

241
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,149
Yeah, you're right.

242
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,449
I think I know what that is.

243
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,161
It's a five-by-five tap code used by POWs.

244
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,539
That would only get us to 25 letters,
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

245
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,292
No, not if you combine <i>C</i> and <i>K.</i>
They sound the same.

246
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,379
Let's try it out.

247
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,217
-Worth a shot.
-All right.

248
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,891
-There it is.
-It looks different than before.

249
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,643
That's because I realized that
there was a flaw with Velocity-Eight,

250
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:15,897
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix and...

251
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,356
Velocity-Nine.

252
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,942
You know what they say.
Ninth time's the charm.

IRIS WEST: <i>Hey.</i>

254
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,820
Hey, Iris. You okay?

255
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,033
Yeah. I'm just a little worried
about the time.

256
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,037
Well, don't worry. They'll make it back
before we close the breach.

257
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,582
Um, actually, I was here to talk to you
about something else.

258
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,626
Oh, yeah, sure, what is it?

259
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:42,506
Well, my new editor (CHUCKLES)
wants me to write a scathing article

260
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,718
on the Flash not being able to protect
Central City from Geomancer.

261
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,055
-Really?
-Yeah.

262
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,893
I was hoping
to write an article about you instead.

263
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,980
Something that would calm people
until Barry got back.

264
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,775
You know, Iris,
I don't know if that's the best idea.

265
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:06,780
Well, I think that if people knew that
there was someone that could protect them,

266
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,449
it would really help.

267
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,827
Would you just think about it?

to be honest.

Looks like your Velocity-Nine's a winner.

It's a work in progress, Elsa.

336

And you think
that would make me turn on Zoom?

The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

it doesn't work like that over here.

If I tell you, he'll kill me.

But if I kill you and take you to him,

344

I bet he'd be pretty pleased with me.

Maybe even let me off my leash.

Jay, we need to do something.

564
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,721
Our only chance is to reboot the
electromagnetic insulators

565
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,266
and hope the quark matter
redistributes equally.

-We have to do it manually.

when they power on

or you'll get sucked into the breach.

Not if I create a vortex
to counteract the pull.

-The more we talk about it,

577
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,124
the less sure I'll be,
so let's just do it.

00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,375
Okay.

579
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,919
There's an override switch
on every stabilizer ring.

580
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,005
I'll create the vortex,
and you flip all of them.

-They should all reboot.
-Got it.

582
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,260
Once that's done, you power up the cannon.
The breach should stabilize.

(GRUNTS)

622
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,387
Forgetting someone, Flash?

623
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,972
Let him go.

624
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,765
Close the breach.

625
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:32,977
Tell Jesse I love her.

626
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,312
Tell her yourself.

627

(GRUNTS)

628
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,153
It shouldn't be taking this long.

(GRUNTS)

630
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,827
Close it! Close it now!

631
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,958
You did it. You made it.

632
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,795
Barry.

633
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,513
(GRUNTS)

634
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,306
No!
