1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,698
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:05,704
LOEB:<i> My best wishes to</i>
Commissioner Essen.

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,239
Welcome back, Jim.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,275
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>you pulled this off,</i>

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>but I'm glad you did.</i>

6
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,314
BRUCE:<i> Sometimes the right way</i>
<i>is also the ugly way.</i>

7
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:18,050
ESSEN:<i> There's been an incident</i>
<i>at Arkham Asylum.</i>

8
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,852
<i>Six inmates have escaped.</i>

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,414
Barbara Kean
was one of them.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,256
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,059
The world sees
criminal lunatics.

12
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,595
<i>I see brilliance.</i>

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,630
<i>Gotham will tremble</i>

14
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,032
before you.

15
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,971
BRUCE:<i> "I beg of you, my son,</i>
<i>please choose happiness.</i>

16
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,607
<i>"Unless you feel a calling.</i>

17
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,375
A true calling."

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,079
THEO:
<i>Mr. Mayor,</i>

19
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,415
you want to know
what I really am?

20
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,016
JAMES (muffled):
Yes, sir.

21
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,484
Shall I tell you?

22
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,719
Please, please.

23
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,054
(sobs)

24
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,156
At heart...

25
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:00,893
I'm an ardent student
of human nature.

26
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,430
Fascinating paradox,
we are.

27
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:07,433
So wise, and yet so foolish.

28
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,601
So brave, and yet so fearful.

29
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,904
For instance,
this is a glass jar.

30
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,573
Inside of it is a hairy spider.

31
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,909
A tarantula, I guess,
but I'm no expert.
(sobs)

32
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,078
In a minute, I'm gonna
open that little hatch

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,314
in the front of your box, I'm
gonna drop the spider inside,

34
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,650
and I'm gonna close it.

35
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:25,932
(sobs)

36
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,053
That's choice A.

37
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,688
Choice B:

38
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,657
I open the hatch,

39
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,525
you speak to your
lovely secretary Maggie

40
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,793
on the telephone,

41
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,955
you tell her you've run away
with some woman,

42
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,732
you'll be sending written
instructions shortly.

43
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,269
So which is it,
choice A or choice B?

44
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,572
Choice B, please.
Please, choice B.

45
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,207
The telephone.

46
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,209
Of course.

47
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,177
It's human nature.

48
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,948
See?

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,817
There is no spider.

50
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:05,224
But if you don't do what I ask,
you'll wish there was one.

51
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,726
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,095
Don't fret so.

53
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,965
You're part of a great endeavor.

54
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,335
A great cleansing.

55
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:19,705
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

56
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,706
Monsters.

57
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,244
Who will
cleanse this city

58
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:29,414
in blood and fire.

59
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,787
(urgent chatter, phones ringing)

60
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,394
What the hell is this?

61
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,729
(man screams outside)

62
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,130
"Where is Mayor James?

63
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,266
Who is his mystery lover?"
No one cares

64
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,308
who the mayor is banging!
(man screams outside)

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,910
You can do better
than this, people.

66
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:53,739
Now go out and get me
some headlines, damn it!

67
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,440
(man screams outside)

68
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,043
(people murmuring)

69
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,246
Yeah. All right,
all right.

70
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,117
Oh, my God.

71
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,886
(man screams)

72
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,988
(body thuds)
Perfect.

73
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,623
Next.

74
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,392
Mr. X.

75
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,760
(muffled whimpering)

76
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,931
(laughs)

77
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,899
(grunts)

78
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,768
Uh, a little to the right.

79
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,637
Okay, that's the spot.

80
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,640
(man screams)

81
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,522
(body thuds)

82
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:30,909
(crowd gasps in distance)

83
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,778
Perfect.

84
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,648
What shall we do
with the... spare?

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,787
Ooh!

86
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,556
I know.

87
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,225
(sighs)

88
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,997
Aaron.

89
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,765
Would you kindly?

90
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,537
(man screams)

91
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,241
(body thuds,
crowd gasps in distance)

92
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,786
"Maniax!"

93
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,954
(laughs)

94
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,956
Now that's a headline.

95
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,524
(cackles)

96
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,366
You all know
what we're facing here.

97
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,768
48 hours ago,
six criminally insane inmates

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,504
were busted out
of Arkham Asylum.

99
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,441
Yesterday, four of those inmates
broke into Yellen Shipyard,

100
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,809
kidnapped seven workers,

101
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,612
then dropped them off the roof
of the<i> Gotham Gazette.</i>

102
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,648
As of now,
we still have no leads

103
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,810
on the person or persons
behind the breakout.

104
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,486
Jim Gordon's lead. Jim.

105
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,988
These are our targets.

106
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,127
Jerome Valeska, 18 years old.

107
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,195
Matricide.

108
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,031
Arnold Dobkins,

109
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,999
schizophrenic.

110
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,634
Poisoner,

111
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,269
rapist.

112
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,937
Aaron Helzinger.

113
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,409
Killed his entire family
with his bare hands.

114
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,144
Robert Greenwood.

115
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,579
Killed and then ate
a dozen women.

116
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,118
Barbara Kean.

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,888
Killed her parents.

118
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,858
We're gonna work this
in groups of four.

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,561
I'll hand out assignments
throughout the day.

120
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,863
Alvarez is
my coordinating officer.

121
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,031
Any questions?

122
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,867
Let's get to work.

123
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,744
Fine job yesterday, gentlemen.

124
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,845
We opened big.

125
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,807
The whole city knows
your name now.

126
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,466
So, bravo. Let's give
ourselves a round of applause.

127
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,855
Now that we have
Gotham's attention,

128
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,191
it's time for the Maniax
to make a grand entrance.

129
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,027
Wasn't that it?

130
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,996
That was the overture.

131
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,334
Now the audience is hushed,
expectant.

132
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,204
The curtain rises...

133
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,439
Then what happens?

134
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,642
Oh, then we
confront Gothamites

135
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,204
with their most
primal fears.

136
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,482
Take from them all they
hold dear and sacred.

137
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,618
And then what happens?

138
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,222
Why, then,
we offer them salvation.

139
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,457
And then they are ours.

140
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,926
Let's get busy, man.

141
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,927
Patience.

142
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:36,895
First, you gentlemen

143
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,964
need to learn
a little stagecraft.

144
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,499
Stagecraft?

145
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,067
You're going to be on TV.

146
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,803
You have to present yourselves
with style and vigor.

147
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,906
Dobkins, say "Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen."

148
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,242
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,910
Again, with a smile.

150
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,715
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,983
(sighs) You.

152
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,753
(clears throat)

153
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,690
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

154
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,658
Not bad.

155
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,861
Sinister and authoritative.

156
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,999
Never mind.

157
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,367
Jerome.

158
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,003
(clears throat)

159
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,373
Ladies and gentlemen,

160
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,943
good evening!

161
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,111
Very good.

162
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,113
Boyishly charming.

163
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,281
(cackles)

164
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,649
The laugh is fabulous.

165
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,017
Use that.
(whip cracks)

166
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,452
JAMES:
Ow!

167
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,554
Ow! Ow!

168
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,823
(women laughing)

169
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,991
(laughing)

170
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,126
BARBARA:
Now me.

171
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,061
Ow!

172
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,933
I am so glad that
you two are getting along,

173
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,068
but we're
a little busy here,

174
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,003
so if you could
leave the poor mayor alone...

175
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:52,971
We're bored.

176
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,107
Yeah. Why do the boys
get to have all the fun?

177
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,576
Your time is coming.

178
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,145
I told you.

179
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,715
You haven't killed him,
have you?

180
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,784
No, I don't think so.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,787
(muffled groaning)

182
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,056
Nope. Hanging in there.

183
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,225
When?

184
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,327
When is my time coming?

185
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,330
Soon.

186
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,732
Very soon.

187
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,934
Why don't you tell me
about James Gordon.

188
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,973
What do you want to know?

189
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,754
It's hard to believe.

190
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,822
My father's been

191
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:47,158
sneaking down here for years,
and I never even knew about it.

192
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,227
That makes two of us,
doesn't it?

193
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,565
Wait.

194
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,367
Let's just think
about this.

195
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,489
Are you certain you want
to turn that bloody thing on?

196
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:58,790
Of course I'm certain.

197
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,839
Have you thought it through,
Master Bruce?

198
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,401
This computer could contain
all my father's research

199
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,843
into Wayne Enterprises.

200
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,405
All this time, I've been
looking for a smoking gun,

201
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,780
and here it is.

202
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,714
Exactly. A smoking gun.

203
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,784
Now, guns are for grown-ups,
aren't they?

204
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,589
That's a metaphor, Alfred,
not an argument.

205
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,357
(computer whirring, beeping)

206
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,926
Here it is.

207
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,798
It's working!

208
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,734
What are you...
What are you doing?!

209
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,436
Alfred, stop!
What are you doing?!

210
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,204
No, what are you
doing, Alfred?!

211
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,439
Alfred, stop it!

212
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,740
It's ruined!

213
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,208
It's ruined!
What's wrong with you?!

214
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,530
Why would you do that?!
Answer me!

215
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:39,812
It had to be done, Master Bruce!

216
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,114
This was the key
to exposing Wayne Enterprises.

217
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,356
Everything that
I've worked for,

218
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,986
everything my... everything
my dad worked for is now gone!

219
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,220
Because of you!

220
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,622
If I'd known what was down here,

221
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,624
I would have never
helped get you in.

222
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,186
I mean, look around you.
Look, look. Liters of blood.

223
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:58,063
A bulletproof vest
with two slugs in it!

224
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,198
Guns, weapons!

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,633
I mean, whatever's
on that computer

226
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,501
probably killed your father,
and I'll be damned

227
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,704
if I see you suffer
the same fate,

228
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,839
Master Bruce.

229
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,107
(sniffles)

230
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,669
I'm trying
to protect you.

231
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,894
(sobs softly)

232
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,351
I'm trying to keep you safe.

233
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,755
I want you to go.

234
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,657
Look, I know that you're...
No.

235
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,225
that you're upset, you...
Alfred.

236
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,894
I want you to go

237
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,731
and never come back,
do you understand me?

238
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,334
You're fired.

239
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,016
Very well, Master Bruce.

240
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,852
As you wish.

241
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,854
(footsteps receding)

242
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,791
Ooh! Shiny.

243
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,293
(laughs)

244
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,029
Give that back.

245
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,930
I saw it first.

246
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,866
No, you didn't.

247
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,135
I said give it back.

248
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,470
Make me, you little brat.

249
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,039
DOBKINS:
Ooh.

250
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,440
Ooh. (chuckles)

251
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,075
JEROME:
Your samurai skills

252
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,943
are excellent Greenwood San,

253
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,180
but they are nothing
compared to me.

254
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,082
(chain saw buzzing)

255
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,017
Prepare to die!

256
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Rum, rum, rum! (laughs)

257
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,057
That's enough! That's good.

258
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,559
I tried
to stop them.

259
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,829
Boys, we're a team.

260
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,465
We don't fight
amongst ourselves.

261
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,467
Yeah, we're a<i> team,</i> boys.

262
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,669
And I'm the captain.

263
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,039
Captain of my foot.

264
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,340
I've murdered

265
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,975
a dozen women.

266
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,911
Terrorized the city.

267
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,193
What have you done?

268
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:56,881
Chop up your mommy?

269
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,918
Everybody has to start
somewhere.

270
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,456
See, I have vision
and ambition and brains.

271
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,025
You're just
a nutty old cannibal.

272
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,261
How many people can you eat
before that shtick gets old?

273
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,230
I could eat one more.

274
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,932
THEO:
I can see we're gonna have

275
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,668
to resolve this one
once and for all.

276
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,211
You all know
this game,

277
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,846
right?
Oh, love it.

278
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,521
Who wants to be
the boss?

279
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,556
Ladies first.

280
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,435
(gun clicks)

281
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,837
(chuckles)

282
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,911
Hey, Greenwood,

283
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,847
what's the secret
to good comedy?

284
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,983
(gun clicks)

285
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,518
Timing.

286
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,255
And what's courage?

287
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,290
(gun clicks)

288
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,058
Grace under pressure.

289
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,994
And...

290
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,632
...who's the boss?

291
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,770
(gun clicks)

292
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,606
I'm the boss.

293
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,176
(laughing)

294
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,875
I believe you
are, Jerome.

295
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,053
I believe you are.

296
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,788
<i>Arigato, sensei.</i>

297
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,190
Whoo! Hee!

298
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,224
(music playing)

299
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,826
Thank you.

300
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,395
Four lunatics and Barbara?

301
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,830
Brother, you got no luck.

302
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,699
I told you civilian life
was better, didn't I?

303
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,800
Yeah, you did.

304
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,203
Actually, that's kind of
why I'm here.

305
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,685
Yeah?
Yeah.

306
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,072
SCOTTY:
What are you doing here?

307
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,074
Jim, you remember

308
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,809
Scotty, my girlfriend.

309
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,977
Fiancée.

310
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,645
Right, my fiancée.

311
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,013
Yeah, Scotty, good to see you.

312
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,449
Relax, honey bun.
We're just talking.

313
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,884
Oh, like hell you are.

314
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,019
He's gonna ask you
to come back to work.

315
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,421
He didn't ask
me anything.

316
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,823
We're just having a chat.
Oh, is that right?

317
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,785
Is that why you're here,
Detective?

318
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,594
Just to have a chat?

319
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:23,895
No, no. She's right.

320
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,698
Harvey, I need your help.
The case is a bear.

321
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,467
We're short-handed, and, uh, I
was thinking maybe you could...

322
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,535
He has a life.

323
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,103
The answer is no.

324
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,137
He is not coming back.

325
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,272
BULLOCK:
Hon.

326
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,907
I'm telling him no.

327
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,243
But it's like she said,

328
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,246
I have a life.

329
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,280
I get it.

330
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,382
I get it.

331
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,384
I'm happy for you.

332
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,685
Just a thought.

333
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,807
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

334
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:52,257
Jim, one last thing.

335
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,539
One last thought

336
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,493
from your Uncle Harvey.

337
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,528
These Maniax killed
a bunch of people

338
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,530
from the shipyard, right?

339
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,033
Yellen Shipyard, yeah.

340
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,201
Why there?

341
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,904
They could've gone anywhere,
killed anyone.

342
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:09,974
But these lunatics specifically
chose that shipyard. I...

343
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,543
wonder why.

344
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,279
Good to see you.

345
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,814
Scotty.

346
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,316
GORDON:
Yeah. Call you back.

347
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,717
Commissioner!

348
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,959
Tell me something good. Please.

349
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:23,321
Harvey isn't coming back.
That's not good.

350
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,823
But he did suggest a lead
that panned out nicely.

351
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,359
Turns out, the Maniax
stole a refueling truck

352
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,627
from the shipyard yesterday.

353
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,895
Why wasn't it reported?

354
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,064
It was one of over a hundred
service vehicles.

355
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,186
Took a while to track down
the entire fleet.

356
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,969
But when we did,
we found that one was missing.

357
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,837
Fully loaded with gasoline.

358
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,439
You get a license plate?

359
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,721
And a description
of the vehicle.

360
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,108
Put out an APB.

361
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,030
God, I'm so glad
you're back, Jim.

362
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:48,055
Me, too.

363
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,716
Wish I could say
the same for Bullock.

364
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,419
I-I can't believe
he's really gone.

365
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,520
He's a cop.

366
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,422
He was born to be a cop.

367
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,257
Not anymore. He's a happy man.

368
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,326
I didn't have it in me
to push him.

369
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,896
You ever think about that?

370
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,198
Walking away, I mean.

371
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,599
No.

372
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,801
You?

373
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,171
I did, for a long time.

374
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,639
But not anymore?

375
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,810
I've sat back and watched
all the corrupt, lazy men

376
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,447
buy their way into this job
and waste it.

377
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,148
Not me, Jim.

378
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,550
Not me.

379
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,485
A new day.

380
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,354
You're damn right.

381
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,776
I'd just like to say
it's been an honor

382
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,812
and a privilege to serve
you and your family, sir.

383
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,249
Thank you.

384
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,686
If you need any references,
I'll be happy to provide them.

385
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,493
Is that all
you're taking with you?

386
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,863
It's all I have, sir.

387
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,536
Right. Well, um...

388
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,605
Oh, dear, yes. I best be off.

389
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,141
I've got a train to catch.

390
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,279
Good-bye, sir.

391
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,750
Good-bye, Alfred.

392
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,352
Beg your pardon, sir?

393
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,454
I said good-bye.

394
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,456
Yes.

395
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,863
Good-bye, sir.

396
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,614
I spy with my little eye

397
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,017
something that is...

398
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,689
...yellow.

399
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,571
(chanting):
Score, Gotham, score!

400
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:14,659
We want more!

401
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,262
Hit 'em where it hurts
and knock 'em to the floor!

402
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,997
(whooping)

403
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,268
Yay, Gotham!

404
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,588
Oh. Hello, Ms. Kringle.

405
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,655
(door closes)

406
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,291
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

407
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,127
How's your day going?

408
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,262
(chuckles) Fine.

409
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,231
Um, question for you.

410
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,037
Y-Yes?
Um...

411
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,472
(laughs)

412
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,143
Did you know that
houseflies hum

413
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,078
in the key of F?

414
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,913
(sighs)

415
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,314
No.

416
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,315
(clears throat)

417
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,051
No, I-I did not know that.

418
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,053
Okay, then.

419
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,292
Well, uh... bye.

420
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,760
Bye.

421
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,268
Damn it!

422
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,371
We agreed you were
going to ask her out.

423
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,573
No, we didn't agree to ask her.

424
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,141
We agreed to think about
asking her.

425
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,309
But there's no point.

426
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,644
She doesn't like you.

427
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,778
NYGMA:
Maybe she'll like me.

428
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,381
You ever consider that?

429
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,284
Maybe she'll like me.

430
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,685
I got confidence.

431
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,320
Ladies love that.

432
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,156
No, she won't like you.

433
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,392
She won't.

434
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,594
Go away.

435
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,698
Please, just go away!

436
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,171
Hey.

437
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,609
(cheerleaders cheering)

438
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,613
(horn honking)

439
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,456
Ooh!

440
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,258
(cheerleaders murmuring)

441
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,227
(sighs)

442
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,229
(cheerleaders screaming)

443
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,033
We got a sighting
of the stolen truck.

444
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,568
Yeavely Park.

445
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,973
(cheerleaders whimpering)

446
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,815
JEROME:
I want you all to know

447
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,844
this was a very difficult
decision for us.

448
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,848
It was between you and
a senior citizen bingo party.

449
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,451
In the end,
we decided

450
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,286
to skew a little younger.

451
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,088
Youth won the day.

452
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,656
Sorry.

453
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,358
Give me an "O"!

454
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,726
(cheerleaders whimpering)

455
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,429
(cheerleaders screaming)

456
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,265
I said give me a "O."

457
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,532
CHEERLEADERS:
"O."

458
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,034
JEROME:
Give me an "N."

459
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,869
CHEERLEADERS: "N."
Give me another "O"!

460
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,105
CHEERLEADERS: "O."
What does that spell?

461
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,375
"Oh, no!"

462
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,844
(cheerleaders screaming)

463
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,658
Do it! Do it! Do it!

464
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,493
Ready?

465
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,428
Okay!

466
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,130
(cheerleaders screaming)

467
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,870
This is so embarrassing.

468
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,772
Anyone got a light?

469
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,409
I do. I got...

470
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,345
(sirens approaching)

471
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,946
(tires screeching)

472
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,224
JEROME:
Stand your ground, boys.

473
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,786
They can't shoot at a bus.

474
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,348
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

475
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,862
Aaron, Greenwood, get
the truck started.

476
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,432
We're gonna blow
this barbecue.

477
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,268
Oh.

478
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:24,008
(gun clicks)

479
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,879
Light 'em up!

480
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,750
(Jerome cackling)

481
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,856
(cheerleaders screaming)

482
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,729
(cackling)

483
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,701
(cackling)

484
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,238
(cheerleaders screaming)

485
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,078
(engine starts)

486
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,722
(explosion in distance,
cheerleaders scream)

487
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,762
(cheerleaders sobbing)

488
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,100
Everybody okay?

489
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,936
Who broke you out,
Dobkins?

490
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,272
Gonna have to talk sooner
or later; tell me now.

491
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,708
I'm a victim here,
sir. I was coerced.

492
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,942
Abducted and coerced.

493
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,504
By who?
If I tell you that,

494
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:36,066
I got to get some
kind of guaran...

495
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,064
(silenced gunshots)

496
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,177
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

497
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,570
I understand you were just
trying to protect me.

498
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,872
But there's nothing...

499
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,434
nothing that you
can do to stop me

500
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,996
from carrying out
my father's work.

501
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,861
I know that now.

502
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,283
I don't want you to go, Alfred.

503
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:51,188
But you're either with me
or you're against me.

504
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,158
And if you're against me,
I don't have a choice.

505
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,693
I'm with you, Master Bruce.

506
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,496
I've always been with you.

507
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,532
But what you're doing
is tantamount to suicide.

508
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,500
This is big boy stuff.

509
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,035
You're too young;
you're not ready.

510
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,037
Then make me ready.

511
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,439
You-You've lived

512
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:11,375
a dangerous life,
and you survived.

513
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:12,843
So teach me.

514
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,712
Teach me how to do the same.

515
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,614
I'll do whatever it takes.

516
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,896
I'll train every day.

517
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:19,658
Yeah, well, you said that
before, didn't you?

518
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:20,651
That was before.

519
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,987
Now I know the truth.

520
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,189
And I know what I have to do.

521
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,060
I'll even go back to school
if you want.

522
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,964
School, even?

523
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,306
If I agree to help you,

524
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:46,076
to make you ready,
you must do exactly

525
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,978
as I say and when I say it

526
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,180
with no exceptions,
is that understood?

527
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,986
Understood.

528
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,593
But, in return, you
must fix that computer.

529
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,929
Fix it?

530
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,298
How on earth
am I gonna do that?

531
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,934
That's not my problem.

532
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,496
I'm not the one
who broke it.

533
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,245
High caliber, high velocity.

534
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,167
Judging by the size
of the wounds,

535
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,249
it was definitely shot
from some distance.

536
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,517
Someone knew how to shoot.

537
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,686
Who, damn it?

538
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,728
And why cheerleaders?
Where's the motive?

539
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,856
They didn't even ask
for a ransom.

540
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,825
They want headlines.

541
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,860
They want mass panic.

542
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,529
Well, they got it.
ESSEN: Yeah.

543
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,664
Let's see if we can't
I.D. that bullet.

544
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,199
Never know your luck.

545
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,336
(door opens, closes)

546
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,870
(sighs) Holding up?

547
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,672
Holding up.

548
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,007
Love you.

549
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,309
Likewise.

550
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,949
(door opens, closes)

551
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,353
("In a Sentimental Mood" by Duke
Ellington & John Coltrane plays)

552
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,626
Gin and tonic, please,
uh, governor.

553
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,628
Ice and a slice.

554
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,133
Nice place.

555
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,136
It is.

556
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,871
Been here before,
then, have you?

557
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,153
It's my regular spot.

558
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,841
Oh, right,
you're a local.

559
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:24,842
Nice.

560
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,211
Don't I know you?

561
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,714
Do you?

562
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,717
Yeah.

563
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,918
You're that Mr. Fox,

564
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,589
that scientific chap from
Wayne Enterprises, ain't you?

565
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,524
That is me.

566
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,426
Alfred Pennyworth.

567
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,629
Young Master Bruce Wayne's
guardian.

568
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,332
Ah, yes.

569
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,735
It's a funny old game
though, isn't it?

570
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,971
Coincidence, I mean,
me bumping into you like this.

571
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,106
I mean...

572
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,143
I was just
thinking about you.

573
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,082
Hmm.

574
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,644
Okay, Mr. Pennyworth,
I'll bite.

575
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,206
What were you
thinking about me?

576
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,755
Oh, no. "Alfred," please.

577
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,658
Please, "Lucius."

578
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,494
Lucius. Lucius.

579
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,231
You know...

580
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,100
I once knew this geezer
called Onslow

581
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,103
in the Isle of Dogs
in the East End of London.

582
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,605
Lairy little scallywag, he was.

583
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,475
He was, uh, too smart by half;
never trusted him.

584
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:34,244
Anyway, one day, Lucius,
he comes bowling up to me,

585
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:39,116
and he asks me to do him
this right iffy favor.

586
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,118
Oh, it doesn't matter
what it was.

587
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,988
The point being,
against my better judgment,

588
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,523
I agreed to do it.

589
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:50,227
But, Lucius, I told him,
I told him straight, I said,

590
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,230
"You let me down, Onslow,

591
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,934
I'll tuck you up, sunshine,
like a kipper."

592
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,571
He swears blind,

593
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,140
swears on his mother's grave
he'd never do such a thing,

594
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:04,475
but of course he did.

595
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,744
Couldn't help himself;
he let me down.

596
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,982
So I tucked him up.

597
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,184
Like a kipper.

598
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,322
What is a kipper?

599
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,825
It's a type of smoked fish.

600
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,895
Very nice with eggs
and brown toast for breakfast.

601
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:30,701
But what I learned
from Onslow is this.

602
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,904
There are two types of people
on this planet, you see.

603
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:37,841
Them you can trust...

604
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,176
and them you can't.

605
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:42,045
I cannot disagree.

606
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,482
Which kind are you?

607
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,044
Both kinds of people
would give you

608
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:50,606
the same answer,
wouldn't they?

609
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:51,321
Exactly.

610
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,123
Exactly right.

611
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,193
There lieth
the problem, Lucius.

612
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,729
You see, I need
to confide in you.

613
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,433
But I need to know
that you're trustworthy.

614
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,737
Perhaps I should decline
your confidence.

615
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,299
I don't like the sound
of these kippers.

616
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,341
Yeah, well, it's a bit late
for that, unfortunately.

617
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,944
I mean, it's you, after all,
Lucius, that created this mess

618
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:18,081
when you told young Master Bruce
that his dear old dead dad...

619
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,683
was a stoic.

620
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,018
Ah.

621
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,352
"Ah," exactly.

622
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,421
You see,
there's a problem.

623
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:29,226
I got no one else to turn to.

624
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,662
I have to confide in you.

625
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,963
I see.

626
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,299
Do you?

627
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:39,236
Let me just be
crystal clear about this.

628
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,372
If it turns out...

629
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,374
that I can't trust you,

630
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,110
I swear
on my mother's grave,

631
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,314
you, my old sausage...

632
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:55,319
...are a dead man.

633
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:01,291
I have only the best
intentions for Bruce Wayne.

634
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,998
Well, another gin and tonic
please, uh, governor.

635
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,068
And whatever this young man
is drinking, one for yourself.

636
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,074
How are you
at fixing computers?

637
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,010
(phone ringing)

638
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,212
Hey, Alvarez!
Yo.

639
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,848
Let ballistics know we got
a red ball for them, will you?

640
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,130
On it.

641
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:26,950
Gordon.

642
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,753
BARBARA:
Hello, Jim. It's Barbara.

643
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,463
Hi, Barbara.

644
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,064
How are you?

645
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,333
BARBARA:
Oh, me? I'm fabulous.

646
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,215
How are you?

647
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,702
I'm good. What's new?

648
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:49,006
Oh, Mr. Cool Guy, huh?

649
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,741
You must be so mad at me.

650
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,075
Listen to me.

651
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,678
If you turn yourself in,
I can help you.

652
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,480
(scoffs) How, Jim?

653
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,814
By taking me back to Arkham?

654
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,349
I don't think so.

655
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,450
You're sick.

656
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,052
Oh. Of course.

657
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,554
Everything's always my fault.

658
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,423
So typical.

659
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,891
Listen to me.

660
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,293
I know you, Barbara.

661
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,135
I know you.

662
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,596
You're a good, kind woman.

663
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,597
This isn't you.

664
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,431
(laughs)

665
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,234
Oh, you could always
make me laugh.

666
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,469
(laughing)

667
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,809
How do I look?

668
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,215
I need to talk to
Commissioner Essen right away.

669
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,497
It's an emergency.

670
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:42,162
Yeah, go ahead.
She's right upstairs.

671
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,131
Yo, Commish.

672
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah?

673
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,206
Heard you were looking for us.

674
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,544
(explosion, gunfire,
officers shouting)

675
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,257
(Kringle screams)

676
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,467
Barbara!

677
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,303
Don't move.

678
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,972
You're wrong about me, Jim.

679
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,976
I tried telling you,
but you never listen.

680
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,412
I'm listening now.

681
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,314
Yeah, sure you are. Now.

682
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,983
Come on.

683
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,119
Let's go talk this through, huh?

684
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,820
Oh, it's too late for that.

685
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,589
(Aaron yells)

686
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,938
Ow.

687
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:07,978
(thudding, grunting continues)

688
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,787
Aaron.

689
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,556
That's enough.

690
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,898
(groans)

691
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,500
I'm not sick. I'm free.

692
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,003
You don't get that.

693
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,071
I could explain it,

694
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,113
but you should probably
get back to work.

695
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,282
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone?

696
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,209
(gasps)

697
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,511
(kisses)

698
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:51,588
(man grunts)

699
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,990
(gunfire, screaming continues
in distance)

700
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,328
(laughs)

701
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,247
(whistles)

702
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,949
Hell of a first week

703
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,350
you're having,
Commissioner.

704
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,152
I wish I could tell you

705
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,955
that things were gonna
get better for you.

706
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,691
They're not.

707
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,060
Here, bring that up here.

708
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,929
Get a better angle
of the room.

709
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,831
Why are you doing this?

710
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,266
To rule the world.

711
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,548
Blah, blah, blah.

712
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,216
But we'll settle
for some dead cops

713
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:40,504
and some good P.R.

714
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,539
(chuckles)
Kidding.
Yeah.

715
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,574
Whatever. I get it.
You're just crazy.

716
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,576
"Crazy"?

717
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,782
Look at me.

718
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:56,186
You can see I'm not crazy.

719
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,855
Very soon,
little man,

720
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,191
you will be dead.

721
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,560
And the world will go on
without you.

722
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,595
You'll be nothing.

723
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,898
No one will even
remember your name.

724
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,300
Mm.

725
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,401
No.

726
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,137
That is where you're wrong,

727
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,639
old lady.

728
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,675
We will leave a mark
on this city.

729
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:22,479
We will spread across it
like a virus.

730
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:25,882
Do you know why?

731
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,618
There's nothing more
contagious than laughter.

732
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,657
My line.

733
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,161
There's nothing
more contagious than laughter.

734
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,563
(laughs loudly)

735
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,035
That was strangely pleasant.

736
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,317
Do it again.

737
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:48,038
Oh!

738
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,506
That's gonna leave a mark.

739
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,009
(laughing)

740
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,612
You got me.

741
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,482
My turn.

742
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,118
(laughing)

743
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,094

Jim!

You hurt?

749
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,854
No. I... I-I was in my office,
and I heard gunfire and I hid.

750
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,255
Where were you?

751
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,724
Barbara was here.
She lured me away.

Hang on, Cap, hang on.

Boss, boss,
stay with me.

756
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,747
Breathe.

757
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,453
It's a new day...

758
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,355
Jim.

759
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,206
This is...

760
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,508
indeed broken.

761
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,572
I have a lot of
questions for you.

762
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,597
Ah, I imagine so.

763
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,544
Did my father tell
you everything?

764
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:16,453
Heavens no.

765
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,495
Your father,
he was a very private man.

766
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,457
He had to be.

767
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,726
I simply helped
with technical resources,

768
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,928
like this computer.

769
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,678
Do you know
what's on it?
No.

770
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,368
I didn't want to know,
to be honest.

771
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,603
But you can fix it?

772
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,505
Mm, I should think so.

773
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,809
But it is going
to take some time.

774
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:49,953
Well, um, thank you
for your help.

775
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,924
I loved your father.

776
00:39:56,628 --> 00:40:00,263
I regret that I never
told him so.

777
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,932
I regret that
I didn't help him more.

778
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,974
Hand me the soldering iron,
will you?

779
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,076
Yeah.

What is it, Alfred?

783
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:24,788
Uh, how you doing,
Mr. Nygma?

784
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,523
I got you an aspirin.

785
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,725
Thank you.

Bruce.

788
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,967
I heard the news. I...

789
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,136
I was worried
something happened to you.

790
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,307
I'm very relieved.

791
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,342
Me, too.

792
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:50,547
Th-The last time that we met,
I was... I was very hard on you.

793
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:54,184
I wanted to apologize.

794
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:57,887
You've been
a really good friend.

795

BULLOCK:
She was a good woman.

797
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,686
Good cop.

798
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:43,466
It's good to see you, but
you don't have to do this.

799
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,702
Let's not talk about it.

800
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:48,371
We are who we are, right?

801
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,740
No use fighting it.

802
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,576
What does Scotty say?

803
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,479
She'll understand.

804
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,714
Or she won't.

805
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,315
OFFICER:
Guys.

806
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,984
You need to see this.

807
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,853
I'm reporting live from
the scene of the GCPD massacre.

808
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,623
We have just obtained
video footage of the attack

809
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,791
recorded by
one of the assailants.

810
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,593
I want to warn
those of you watching,

811
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,061
what you're about to see

812
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,830
is very graphic.

813
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,234
Hello, Gotham City!

814
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,602
We're the Maniax.

815
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:24,073
And I'm Jerome, the shot caller
of our little gang.

816
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,644
We're here to spread
the message of wisdom and hope.

Some people have no manners.

820
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:39,756
You're all prisoners.

821
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,759
What you call sanity,

822
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,895
it's just a prison in your minds
that stops you from seeing

823
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,431
that you're
just little tiny cogs

824
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,100
in a giant absurd machine.

825
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,269
Wake up!

826
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,673
Why be a cog?

827
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:59,642
Be free like us.

828
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,812
(laughing):
Just remember, smile.

829

Oh! Time to go.

832
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,988
But don't worry.

833
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,123
We'll be back very soon.

834
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,092
Hang on to your hats, folks.

835
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,161
'Cause you ain't seen
nothing yet!

836
