1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,207
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,125
When I'm with you,
I don't think about the mission or...

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,567
I trust your judgment.
In fact, I depend on it.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,722
They're designated "Task Force X."

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,043
This ain't no task force.
Let's call it like it is.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,691
The Suicide Squad.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,411
- The choice has been made.
- I'm not accepting it.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,801
- There will be consequences.
- Is that a threat?

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,251
You tell everyone who will listen
what you've seen.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,928
- You are late.
- It's 12:45.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,924
Invitation said 1. I'm early.
And I'm never early.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,926
Yeah, well, the ceremony's at 1.
Photos were at noon.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,525
- Photos.
- Mm-hm.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,765
Last time Lyla and I got married, we said
our vows on an ATV in a Registan desert.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,084
This time, she hired a photographer.
So, yes, Oliver, photos.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,766
That whole "best man" thing,
it's more like a...

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,725
- Not so good.
- No. That's all right. We'll Photoshop you in.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,251
All right.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,006
- Thank you for coming.
- Heh.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,282
- See you brought your plus one.
- Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,966
- Nice to meet you. Ray Palmer.
- John Diggle.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,761
- You hurt her, they'll never find your body.
- Ha. Ha, ha.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,127
Nice to meet you. Pardon me.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,327
Funny. Five months since we saw
each other. Now it's twice in two weeks.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,960
- It's good to see you, Ray.
- Good to see you too.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,166
Ooh. That was Lyla.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,802
Rick was supposed to be our officiant,
but he got deployed to South Sudan.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,684
- You don't have a minister?
- No.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,083
Okay. What about online certificates?
I need Wi-Fi and three minutes.

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,164
Not that I'd officiate,
although I would be honored if you ask.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,961
Or you could just ask me. I'm a minister.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,284
It's a long story.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,483
Normally this is the part where the officiant
offers words of insight about the couple.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,924
Their history.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,766
Which is difficult for me because I just
met John and Lyla eight minutes ago.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,365
And I understand
that you have written your own vows.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,126
Which is great,
because that gives me less to do.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,046
- You really wanna do this?
- Hell, yes.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,362
- Do you?
- Even more than the first time.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,967
Good. Because I'm not letting you
get away from me this time.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,885
- I'm holding you to that.
- Good.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,810
- I love you, Lyla.
- I love you too.

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,405
All right.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,851
John Diggle, Lyla Michaels,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,686
- Beautiful ceremony.
- Beautiful dress.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,925
- Thank you.
- Did it come with a cast?

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,847
I started fighting with a new trainer.
She's enthusiastic.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,082
- "She"?
- She's a friend.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,601
Today's not about that.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,931
- Hey, Laurel.
- Hi.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,125
Nice bouquet.

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,285
Ah, yes. I kind of caught it.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,767
- Well done.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,282
Oh, I hope it's okay
I brought Ray as my date.

55
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,925
Ray saved the day.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,811
For the record,
I am not the one who used that phrase.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,050
He's a good guy
and he clearly cares about you a lot.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,129
- Are you happy?
- Yes. Very.

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,601
Good. That's all I've ever wanted.

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,408
You deserve a good guy
and a normal life.

61
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,601
Oliver.

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,006
There were eight victims total,
all shot with arrows.

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,925
However, one escaped
and has given us a statement.

64
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,527
Which remains uncorroborated
so the district attorney's office...

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,684
...is going to continue
to investigate before filing charges.

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,162
So which one is it?
ls the Arrow being implicated here or not?

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,010
We're not sure of anything yet.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,970
We have a statement from Mr. Palmer.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,683
While it's hard to ignore the good
Arrow has done for this city...

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,525
...it is equally hard to ignore
evidence of his guilt.

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,365
In any case,
the Arrow needs to be apprehended.

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,801
And at least brought to
trial, if not justice.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,207
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,488
I'm devoting my substantial
resources towards...

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,881
...making certain the Arrow
is apprehended.

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,162
Meet with Lance and tell him
it wasn't you.

77
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,210
- My word doesn't carry weight with him.
- Bring in the culprit.

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,045
- Figure out who's doing this.
- We know who's doing this.

79
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,488
- The League of Assassins.
- This is how Ra's al Ghul handles rejection?

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,405
No, I think the point is that he doesn't.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,844
He's trying to turn the city against me. Make
the offer to take his place more appealing.

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,007
Hit the streets.

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,727
Whoever's doing this targets criminals.
We need to know who they'll hit next.

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,930
We need the information
the police have from the crime scene.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,681
Whoever is under that hood
has to leave a trail, something to follow.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,245
How can we help?

87
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,085
- Go to Starling City Airport.
- Okay. To do what?

88
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,561
- It's called a honeymoon.
- Fiji can wait.

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,240
No. Fiji can't wait.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,767
All right? This is still your day.
I'm not gonna let Ra's al Ghul ruin that.

91
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,720
- Oliver...
- You followed me into the lion's den already.

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,850
This time, choose your family.

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,405
Go. Live. We got this.

94
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,764
If it doesn't feel right
for you to go, we won't.

95
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
No, Oliver was right. It's our turn.

96
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,371
Besides, Felicity and Roy have his back.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,363
Mazel tov, newlyweds.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,250
Lawton.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,646
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, when duty calls, we answer, right?

100
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,081
The Suicide Squad rides again.

101
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,884
Sorry to interfere with your
wedding night.

102
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,286
Yeah, I doubt that.

103
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,570
Five hours ago, there was a
terrorist attack in the Republic of Kasnia.

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,327
Hospital was supposed to serve and unite
Kasnia's dissident ethnic faction.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,847
- Wait, is that...?
- Senator Joseph Cray.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,765
This hospital was something
of a pet project for him.

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,321
Of course, he insisted on
being at the ceremony.

108
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,967
Agent Michaels, you'll lead
Task Force X on the extraction.

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,124
I'll have a plane ready for you
in 30 minutes.

110
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,362
I'm sorry, Johnny.

111
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,489
You go on to Fiji,
and I will meet you there in 48 hours tops.

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,167
No, you won't, because
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,490
You remember what I told you
about not letting go?

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,369
I meant that.

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,964
Waller.

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,363
Count me in.
You have the two of us. Deadshot.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,045
Who else is on the team?

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,971
Who else, indeed?
I've always wanted to see the world.

119
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,804
I hear Kasnia's beautiful
this time of year.

120
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,126
Anything?

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,644
I'm accessing traffic cameras, ATM cameras,
phone cameras, 911 and squad car chatter.

122
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,406
- And?
- No sign of evil Arrow.

123
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,881
Los Halcones are unloading
a shipment of narcotics.

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,801
The entire gang is gonna show up. This
is the thing fake Arrow would go after.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,923
We really need a better name for him.

126
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,084
- When is this happening?
- Right now. I'll suit up.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,330
Roy, this is the League. I've got it.

128
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,884
- So did you hire a florist?
- Yes, we did.

129
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,610
Didn't that cost a fortune?

130
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,722
For my wedding, I'll have the bridesmaids
make the flower arrangements.

131
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,565
And I'll spend the extra money
on the dress.

132
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,842
- Anything?
- Nope. We're clear.

133
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,249
- You seeing anybody, Cutter?
- Of course I am.

134
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,247
The Arrow. And our special day
is going to be the most glorious day.

135
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,440
And then afterwards, we'll make
strong, beautiful babies. Ha, ha.

136
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,608
And does he know this?

137
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,729
Listen, I got news for you, stalker. You don't
get to do what we do and have a family.

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,407
I have a wife right here and a child
that say otherwise. Let's hold up here.

139
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,801
Yeah, well, let's hope
you make it home to her.

140
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,885
Love, children, family. It's all just
a distraction for people like us.

141
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,964
They make us better.
Give us something worth fighting for.

142
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,007
Love is a bullet in the brain and if you believe
any different, you're as crazy as she is.

143
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,003
- Hey.
- All right.

144
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,403
Latest satellite flyover
reveals warm bodies here.

145
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,282
Yeah, that's pretty solid. Fortified.
How are we gonna get everyone out?

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,410
Our orders are to retrieve Cray,
no one else.

147
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,006
- What about the hostages?
- They're not U.S. citizens.

148
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,810
Are those your words or Wailer's?

149
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,531
Let's not fight, Johnny.
It's our honeymoon.

150
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,006
See what I mean, John?

151
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,962
I'm not you, Lawton.

152
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,004
Yeah.

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,527
I wasn't always me either.

154
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,445
Just leave the package at the door.

155
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,810
Ma'am, I think you're gonna
want to sign for these.

156
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,047
Ah! Oh, my God. Floyd.

157
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,045
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home? I'm a mess.

158
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,725
No.

159
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,962
No, you're perfect.

160
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,571
Mommy, who is he?

161
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,089
Zoe, baby, this is your daddy, remember?

162
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,481
I told you about him.

163
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,089
He was far away fighting the bad guys.
Now he's home.

164
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,487
Hi, Zoe.

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,685
Your daddy missed you
every second of every day.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,570
She just needs some time.

167
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,925
I got him. Satellite footage of a man. Green
outfit. Green hood on the roof. Hurry.

168
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,686
You can't kill them all, Oliver.

169
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,362
Where one falls, two more rise.

170
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,925
Maseo.

171
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,287
You can't believe in this.

172
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,364
Murdering all of these people
just to prove a point?

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,211
No. To persuade you.

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,327
My master sees something in you.

175
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,650
Don't fight it. Embrace it.

176
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,804
You know me better than that.

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,369
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

178
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,804
Okay, I had no idea the sheer number
of crazies that were in the city...

179
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,243
...until you set up that
1-800 line for Arrow tips.

180
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,243
What's going on?

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,850
Ray?

182
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,570
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

183
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,210
What?

184
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,567
I have a 140 IQ and three PhDs, but...

185
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,042
It's pretty hard to insult my intelligence,
but I think you just did.

186
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,444
It all makes sense now.
Your, uh, sudden disappearances.

187
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,682
Your apprehension with helping
on the mission.

188
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,410
You've been working with the Arrow.

189
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,528
How did you find out?

190
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,967
High spectrum portable radiograph.

191
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,446
Colloquially known as the x-ray machine.
Plus, your facial recognition software.

192
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,967
- Nice code, by the way.
- Hey, you got the suit working.

193
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,565
Hm.

194
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,251
Last night, I saw your friend Oliver
standing over eight of his victims.

195
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,811
Because he was investigating.

196
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,964
He's trying to catch an impersonator,
the one who's doing this.

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,124
Please, you have to trust me.
Oliver's not a killer.

198
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,244
This isn't the first time he's been
judge, jury and executioner.

199
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,325
- He hasn't killed anyone in nearly two years.
- That really is not your best argument.

200
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,721
You have no idea what he's been through.

201
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,410
What he's lost. How he's grown. But I do.
I know him better than almost anyone.

202
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,490
Oliver didn't do this.

203
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,650
- You have feelings for him.
- Yes.

204
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,968
I mean, no.

205
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,849
No.

206
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,684
I did.

207
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,444
But that's...

208
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,811
- That's over now.
- And what?

209
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,924
Now I'm supposed to trust you?

210
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,129
From the moment we've met,
I've held nothing back from you.

211
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,369
I did trust you.

212
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,367
And I thought that you were
someone who could be a true partner.

213
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,320
Thought you were someone that I could
rely on in my mission and in my life.

214
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,726
I wanted that too, Ray. I still do.

215
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,205
Ray-

216
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,208
What are you going to do?

217
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,287
I'm gonna honor the promise
I made to this city.

218
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,847
And help them bring the Arrow to justice.

219
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,846
North entrance clear.

220
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,088
Nice work, Deadshot.
We're en route. Move to the X.

221
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,044
Copy that.

222
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,610
Here you go, sweetie. Eat it.

223
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,324
You won't eat it.

224
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,083
Is there something wrong with it?
It's not as good as Mom makes, I guess.

225
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,529
Use your words!

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,890
- Hm?
- Baby, what's going on?

227
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,611
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- No.

228
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,609
You're not fine.

229
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,682
You're not sleeping. You barely eat.

230
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,887
You can't hold a job. You can't socialize.

231
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,647
You won't talk to me.

232
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,284
We're talking right now.

233
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,841
So tell me what do you
want to talk about?

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,367
I wanna know what happened
to my husband.

235
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,127
You need to tell your story.
There are people who can help you.

236
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,567
Who know
what it's like to come back from war.

237
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,121
They don't understand.
You don't understand.

238
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,807
Nobody understands, do you hear me?

239
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,361
- Make them understand.
- Oh, make them understand.

240
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,725
Like this? You want to
make them understand like that?

241
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,805
How about like this? Huh? Do you want to
know what happened to your husband?

242
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,725
Let me tell you. He pulled triggers.

243
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,724
And every time I did, someone died.

244
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,962
Okay? Every single time.

245
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,365
Floyd.

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,081
Stop it.

247
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,165
Please.

248
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,004
Get away from us.

249
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,321
Yes, this is an emergency.

250
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,409
It's my husband. He has a gun.

251
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,648
Find anything on those arrows?

252
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,682
This one is ours. This one is theirs.

253
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,446
- I don't see a difference.
- Yeah. Precisely.

254
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,329
They're identical.

255
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,010
He knows.

256
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,049
God, he knows.

257
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,203
Last year, Ray's fiancé
was killed by Mirakuru men.

258
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,729
And now he wants to protect the city so he
built a suit out of military-grade technology.

259
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,009
He wants to put you in jail.
He used my software to track you down.

260
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,131
He scanned you with his x-rays. He knows
you're the Arrow. He's gonna tell the cops.

261
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,131
Palmer knows I'm the Arrow?

262
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,168
He has his own mission
to protect the city?

263
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,523
When were you gonna tell me this?

264
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,001
I've been getting a lot of that.
It's not important.

265
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,527
He's gonna tell the police who you are.

266
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,890
Wait, Ray built a super suit?
That's kind of awesome.

267
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,246
And reckless.

268
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,483
Look, he's probably on his way to the
precinct right now. What are we gonna do?

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,722
The radiograph technology is infallible.
These are screenshots with time stamps.

270
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,684
That's a very bold claim, Mr. Palmer.

271
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,765
Especially since we've been down that road
two years ago when Queen was exonerated.

272
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,924
Because he's smart. I believe he
allowed himself to be accused...

273
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,686
...so as to be ruled out
as a suspect in the future.

274
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,606
And your proof is x-ray vision?

275
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,288
Digital images can be fabricated.
I can't go to a judge with any of that.

276
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,130
What about my statement?

277
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,726
You mean your
uncorroborated testimony.

278
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,124
You're protecting him. Of course.
Because you and Oliver are old friends.

279
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,371
You, uh, hurt yourself
signing depositions?

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,641
- At the gym, actually.
- Right. You were training with that...

281
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,010
...wildcat, Grant, right?
The one who also used to be a vigilante.

282
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,407
You and Oliver Queen
used to be a couple, right?

283
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,486
How is it you both
ended up wearing masks?

284
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,645
A word of free legal advice, Mr. Palmer...

285
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,280
...if you go to anyone else,
particularly the media...

286
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,249
...with these unsubstantiated
aflegafionsu.

287
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,168
...Mr. Queen would have the basis
for a slam dunk defamation suit...

288
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,482
...that would leave you bankrupt.

289
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,407
Who knows?
He might even get his company back.

290
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,840
Yeah. You're right. The court system
isn't gonna be able to help me here.

291
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,691
Ah.

292
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,843
Guess I'll just have to seek out
justice on my own.

293
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,326
Don't worry. I'm a United States senator.

294
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,767
Everything's gonna be all right.

295
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,649
Get down! Get down! Get down!

296
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,364
We're here for you, senator,
but we need to move fast.

297
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,881
All right. Everybody, just stay
where you are. Keep calm.

298
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,404
- We'll explain everything once we're in the air.
- What? No. No. This...

299
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,129
It's all wrong. They weren't supposed
to send anybody. That was the whole point.

300
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,922
You shouldn't have come here.

301
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,163
You shouldn't have come here.

302
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,768
We gotta go! We gotta go! Go! Go! Go!

303
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,605
My hero.

304
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,444
Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

305
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,720
What the hell was that lunatic thinking?
Secure these doors. Lawton, on the table.

306
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,410
Take off that shirt.

307
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,131
Bullet was a through and through.
I ain't gonna die.

308
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,045
Pays to be sure. It's
not a request, soldier.

309
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,890
You still gonna patch me up?

310
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,964
Baby, does it hurt bad?
You were so brave.

311
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,128
Okay, I take it back.

312
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,970
I think I do want to die.

313
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,329
Mockingbird, this is Harbinger on
emergency frequency Delta-Charlie.

314
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,609
Task Force X is broadcasting
in the blind. Over.

315
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,765
Damn it. It's not going through.
I think our signal's being jammed.

316
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,406
Harbinger, this is Senator Cray.

317
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,726
Well, I imagine you must all be feeling
a little bit confused right about now.

318
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,571
This is a hostage situation.
A terrorist attack...

319
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,961
Oh, actually, they're not terrorists.
They're mercenaries. They work for me.

320
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,329
- Why would you do that?
- Because I love my country.

321
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,443
And my country loves a hero.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,321
So this is all theater?

323
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,370
- So you can what? Run for president?
- There it is.

324
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,010
The big picture.

325
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,811
Can you imagine what my
poll numbers will be...

326
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,362
...once I heroically defuse
this tragic situation?

327
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,445
Everybody here
was supposed to go home alive.

328
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,523
That was the whole point.

329
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,124
But now, unfortunately, you have turned my
hostages into witnesses.

330
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,611
And I can't have that.

331
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,885
- I'm gonna kill you slow, you son of a bitch.
- You're outgunned and outnumbered.

332
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,042
But if it's any consolation...

333
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,843
...I am gonna nominate the four of you
for the Medal of Honor once I'm president.

334
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,525
You'll be remembered as heroes.

335
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,645
L-leh-

336
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,644
- Arrow.
- Super Suit.

337
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,731
I prefer the Atom.

338
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,407
I have to admit, I was surprised
to find you on my calendar this morning.

339
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,721
Find the place all right?

340
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,242
- Laurel Lance called me.
- Yeah. The Black Canary.

341
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,051
She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.

342
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,000
- I didn't kill those people.
- Yeah. That's what Felicity said.

343
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,051
An impersonator, right?
I hate when that happens.

344
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,249
Five years on a deserted island.

345
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,569
That kind of thing changes you,
doesn't it?

346
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,523
It must have been difficult, if not impossible,
to hold on to your sanity all those years.

347
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,048
And now here you are,
pretending you have everything in control.

348
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,521
Felicity told you the truth.

349
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,522
And you should trust herjudgment.

350
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,885
How can I do that?

351
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,567
Her perception of you is clearly clouded
by her emotional attachment.

352
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,888
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

353
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,120
You have no idea
what this city is up against.

354
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,967
Actually, I think I do.

355
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,128
And I'm gonna stop him.

356
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,563
It's clear.

357
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,451
- Reinforcements just arrived.
- I see them.

358
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,250
Wait.

359
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,401
- Oh, God.
- What? What? What?

360
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,121
Thermal spikes.
Here. Here. Here. And here.

361
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,283
- They've rigged the hospital with explosives.
- Killing all the hostages.

362
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,805
With Cray as the lone survivor.

363
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,525
Why did we come here?

364
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,162
We accepted the mission, Lyla.
We did what soldiers do.

365
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,882
Except we're not just soldiers, Johnny.
We're parents.

366
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,686
I know parents who won't fly together. They
don't wanna risk orphaning their child.

367
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,844
What were we thinking?

368
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,371
Oh, God.

369
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,365
Our baby girl.

370
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,206
- Lawton was right.
- Can you please say that again?

371
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,166
Sorry, I, uh...
I didn't quite hear you the first time.

372
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,320
The Greddians
have rigged the hospital to blow.

373
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,043
- We're not gonna make it.
- Yeah. Yes, we are.

374
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,521
We're gonna get these hostages out.

375
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,401
And you and John are gonna
make it home to your daughter again.

376
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,201
You got it?

377
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,370
Oh, the things I wanna do
to you right now.

378
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,050
- Floyd Lawton.
- Who's asking?

379
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,249
It wasn't a question.
Merely an acknowledgment.

380
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,767
- We've posted your bail.
- "We"?

381
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,884
An organization in need
of your very particular talent.

382
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,088
"Talent." Heh.

383
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,084
Killing people, you mean.

384
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,086
And we will pay handsomely
for the use of those skills.

385
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,482
Again with the "we."

386
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,890
- Who are you?
- Merely a drone.

387
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,531
A piece of a larger entity.

388
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,766
We exist as one organism.
As you might say, a hive.

389
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,009
Well, listen up, honeybee.
I'm done shooting.

390
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,204
I left that life on the battlefield
to come home, be with my family.

391
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,604
I imagine the restraining order your wife
filed against you impedes that plan somewhat.

392
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,651
You'll never be allowed
near her or your daughter again.

393
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,928
You have left the battlefield.

394
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,211
But the battlefield never leaves you.

395
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,566
People like you don't get to
have love, children, families.

396
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,326
These are just distractions
to people like you.

397
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,281
For people like you,
love is a bullet in the brain.

398
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,569
Who's my target?

399
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,171
His name is Andrew Diggle.

400
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,286
- How'd it go with Ray?
- Not well.

401
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,568
Yeah, your new boyfriend is stubborn.

402
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,848
Once he's made his mind up,
that's the end of it.

403
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,930
Sound like anybody we know?

404
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,443
Not only is he untrained, he's unstable.

405
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,524
- "Unstable"?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah, he's unstable, Felicity.

406
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,490
Because he's flying around in a weapon...

407
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,361
...looking for a man
that has already killed eight people.

408
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,524
- He's gonna be next.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

409
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,881
Excuse me?

410
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,527
- You never wanted me to be with him.
- Not true.

411
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,809
Yes, it is. That talk about
wanting me to be happy was just talk.

412
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,046
No, I meant what I said. Right up to the point
where I found out that he is just like me.

413
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,409
- You deserve better.
- What I deserve...

414
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,404
...is to be with someone
who isn't afraid of being happy.

415
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,483
Ray told me he wanted a true partner. In
his work, in his mission and in his life.

416
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,642
Ray wants to be a hero
and a human being.

417
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,081
Because he hasn't realized yet
that he can't be.

418
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:13,726
I told you that I couldn't be with you
and save the city.

419
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,605
And neither can Ray.

420
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,528
He's just too new at this to know that.

421
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,443
- What's that?
- 911 call.

422
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,921
Suspected gang activity
at Meltzer power plant.

423
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,921
This could be Maseo's next target.
Call Roy.

424
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,082
Tell him to suit up,
meet me at the power plant.

425
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,724
There's no one here.

426
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,521
That must be disappointing.

427
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,609
I'm sorry there's nobody for you to kill,
but, uh, I kind of faked that 911 call.

428
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,286
- Palmer.
- I'd say you have the right to remain silent...

429
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,244
...but I'm not a cop.

430
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,050
No.

431
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,491
Agh!

432
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,924
It's over.

433
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,082
That's it. Nice and easy.

434
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,961
The man you think I am,
he'd kill you here and now.

435
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,001
I told you to back off,
and you didn't listen.

436
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,242
So kill me. Go ahead.

437
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,962
Show Felicity the kind of man
you really are.

438
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,203
I have nothing to prove to her.

439
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,963
But you do.

440
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,203
She chose you.

441
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,088
So trust her.

442
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,288
I am, uh...

443
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,801
I am truly sorry.

444
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,803
Everything was supposed to
work out differently.

445
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,410
At the door!

446
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,525
Stop or I flip this switch
and I blow us all right to hell right now.

447
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,283
You're bluffing.
You'd die right along with us.

448
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,762
I wanna be president for my legacy.

449
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,203
Dying a hero is as good
a consolation prize as any.

450
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,806
The Suicide Squad.

451
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,730
Well, you are true to your name
if you think that the three of you...

452
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,848
...can just shoot your way in here.

453
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,565
Wait. There were four of you.

454
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,921
Unh!

455
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,651
John, 7 o'clock.

456
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,127
You've been a very, very bad boy.

457
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,648
Go. Go. Go. Everybody go, go, go!
Get out. Go.

458
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,086
Move! Move! Move!

459
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,081
Move! Move!

460
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,490
Come on.

461
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,689
Come on, let's go. Quickly.

462
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,048
What about you, baby?
How are you getting out?

463
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,770
I'm not.

464
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,570
That's not part of the plan.
You said you could find your way.

465
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,443
Yeah, I lied.
Someone needs to cover your escape.

466
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,171
Me up here is what
gets you out down there alive.

467
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,970
Why?

468
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,444
You and your new wife, you just get back
to your baby girl. All right, John?

469
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,483
Go. Go. Go.

470
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,687
Move. Move.

471
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,165
Go. Go.
Move. Move.

472
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,730
- Keep on moving.
- Go. Go. Go.

473
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,928
Go. Go. Go.

474
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,721
Come on, Floyd.

475
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,405
No!

476
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,681
No.

477
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,364
How are you?

478
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,761
My ego's bruised.

479
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,124
And my arm, and my back,
and my rotator cuff.

480
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,966
I'm so sorry about...

481
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,290
...all of this.

482
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,651
Ah, well, actually, I think I'm the one
who owes you an apology.

483
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,283
You told me Oliver was innocent, and I didn't
trust you. I want you to know that I do.

484
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,406
About what you said earlier...

485
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,244
...about wanting a true partner...

486
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,802
...is that offer still good?

487
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,164
Yeah.

488
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,810
Once I make an offer.

489
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,766
The Greddian separatists
were led by Floyd Lawton...

490
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,764
...a former sniper
for the United States Army.

491
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,924
Lawton was discharged five years ago
and since then...

492
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,163
...has been linked
to numerous terrorist organizations.

493
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,962
Lawton died as a result of an explosion
intended for a group of hostages...

494
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,964
...including Senator Joseph Cray.
But Cray managed...

495
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,282
He paid the hostages for their silence.

496
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,091
Yeah. Well, the dollar
goes a long way in Kasnia, right?

497
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,364
I tried to set the record straight.
Waller blocked me.

498
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,362
Johnny, there's something else.

499
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,204
Yes, there is.

500
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,962
- I'm leaving Team Arrow.
- What?

501
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,691
Lawton was right.
I can't keep living like this.

502
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,205
It only works until it doesn't.
And then what?

503
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,724
I can't do that to Sara.

504
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,564
And what about this city?

505
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,330
The work you and Oliver do,
it's good work.

506
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,731
Not like what I've
been doing for far too long.

507
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,205
Which is why I resigned.

508
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,490
Lyla, no. You love your job.
And you're damn good at it.

509
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,564
If what happened with Cray can be allowed,
I don't want to be.

510
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,242
What I want is to set
a good example for our daughter.

511
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,928
I want her to be proud of me.

512
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,730
Lyla.

513
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,047
I'm proud of you.

514
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,605
I'm proud of you, Lyla.

515
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,721
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

516
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,523
- Hey.
- Hi.

517
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,570
- Where you off to?
- Ray has a meeting with the mayor.

518
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,121
Seems he's had
a change of heart about the Arrow.

519
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,327
Huh.

520
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,767
- Thanks.
- For what?

521
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,045
Proving me right.

522
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,969
- Hey.
- Hi.

523
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,446
What did I miss?

524
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,287
Oh, not much. I'm glad you're back.

525
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,805
So am I. Turns out Lyla and I
are not very good at vacations.

526
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,567
- The Republic of Kasnia, huh?
- Mm-hm.

527
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,328
And Floyd Lawton?

528
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,891
Yeah.

529
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,323
You were right, Oliver.

530
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,326
Doing what we do,
having loved ones at home...

531
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,644
...it's complicated.

532
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,007
Well, the things that matter always are.

533
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,491
To Floyd Lawton.

534
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,085
Any luck finding your imposter?

535
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,931
He's still out there.

536
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,323
We have to stop this guy before
he puts arrows in any more criminals.

537
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,161
Or before he starts putting them
in innocent people.

538
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,050
Madam, I have it on good authority...

539
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,969
...he's been set up.
Hold on a second.

540
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,447
You're telling me you think
the Arrow's innocent?

541
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,763
Of these murders, yes.
I believe he's being framed.

542
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,809
We need to address the media right away.

543
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,128
Tell them what?
Some genius changed his mind?

544
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,171
You're letting your personal feelings
towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

545
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,800
Maybe I'm seeing more clearly
than I have for years.

546
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,201
Enough, both of you.
I am tired of listening...
