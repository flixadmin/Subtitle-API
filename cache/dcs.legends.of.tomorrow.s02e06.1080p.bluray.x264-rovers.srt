00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,678
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,010
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,143
<i>which is why we must travel
through time to stop the spread of</i>

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,397
<i>these so-called Time Aberrations
and to erase their damage to history.</i>

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,933
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,945
<i>so please don't call us heroes,
we're legends.</i>

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,617
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,777
Thank you, Mister...

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,111
Hex. Jonah Hex.

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,707
Temporal Aberrations cause these things
called timequakes.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,163
If there was a way
of locating their epicenters,

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,838
<i>maybe we'll be able to fix the Aberrations
before they happen.</i>

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,779
Hello there, wanderer.

14
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,617
Don't see many folks around here.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,659
Been a while since this old mine turned up
anything worth taking.

16
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,418
Then I guess I'll be on my way.

17
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,170
And let you be on yours.

18
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,589
Oh, ain't you heard?

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,673
I'm the one
that does the letting around here.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,718
- Or do you need a reminder?
- Wait.

21
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,760
I know things about these mines.

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,600
Things I can't tell you if I'm shot.

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,560
Oh, you'll tell me,

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,770
or I'll shoot you otherwise.

25
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,690
Now lower that iron and start talkin'.

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,944
The ore in there, it's rare and powerful.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,245
More powerful than gold.

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,952
And how would you be the one to know that?

29
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,374
I can show you.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,952
With your permission.

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,921
Found it using this.

32
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,720
There's enough in that mine
for the both of us.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,467
<i>We're the only ones who know.</i>

34
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,049
We could be like partners.

35
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,889
Hmm. Give it here.

36
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,984
Nice doing business with you, partner.

37
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,034
What's with bad guys and ancient amulets?

38
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,703
Any idea why Darhk wants this?

39
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,715
All I know is it's never a good idea
when your nemesis starts accessorizing.

40
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,217
- And he's teamed up with a speedster.
- What's a speedster?

41
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,595
Someone with super speed.
It's how Darhk escaped.

42
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,097
The energy of the Speed Force
grants the speedster

43
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,053
chronokinesis, temporal manipulation.

44
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,342
English, Professor.

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,854
It means that his running real fast
lets him time travel.

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,522
I'll be in my room.

47
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,185
Martin, I need you to gather
everything you can on speedsters.

48
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,523
And Nate's right.

49
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,610
This amulet looks a lot
like the one we recovered off the Nazis.

50
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,241
- There's got to be a connection.
- Let me guess.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,993
I'm on library duty.

52
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,619
JAX: We're dealing with a speedster here.

53
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,031
How long are we gonna
keep this secret from them, Grey?

54
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,825
Come on, future Barry's message.

55
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,119
Yes, I know what
you're talking about, Jefferson.

56
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,628
And we have been through this.

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,498
Barry implored us not to share any...

58
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,259
You okay?

59
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,509
I'm fine, it's just a headache.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,349
You would tell me
if something was up, right?

61
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,181
'Cause if we start keeping things
from each other...

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,811
I just need to rest.

63
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,975
Saving history can be
extremely wearing on the body.

64
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,858
I'm thinking this amulet dates back

65
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,446
to Late Antiquity
and is Judeo-Christian in origin.

66
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,609
Great.

67
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,327
Is that great?

68
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,909
Well, I can't find
a reference of it anywhere.

69
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,119
Like, none.

70
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,834
Historically speaking, this doesn't exist.

71
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,959
Well, this is right in front of us,
so I'd say it does exist.

72
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,965
And we know that Damien Darhk
and this speedster

73
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,421
are willing to kill for it.

74
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,757
SARA: Sounds like you got
some more homework to do.

75
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,348
- What?
- I just thought becoming a superhero,

76
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,601
I would spend less time in the library
than my old job, that's all.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,309
RAY: <i>Well, research skills
are a kind of super power.</i>

78
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,224
And you can turn to steel, so you got two.

79
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,357
Saved by an Aberration.

80
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,487
Ooh, what's the Trouble Alert say?

81
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,648
Look, I told you, don't call it that.

82
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,283
The timequake's epicenter
is Liberty, Colorado, 1874.

83
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,155
Ha! Back to the Wild West.

84
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,494
You guys were in the Old West?

85
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,329
Yeah. Town made me sheriff.

86
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,744
That's cool.

87
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,958
All right, well,
I will go tell Jax and Stein.

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,212
Who wants to tell Rory?

89
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,372
- Not it.
- Not it.

90
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,999
What?

91
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,093
Okay. I'll do it.

92
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,517
I don't know how to use 'em,
but I'm wearing spurs.

93
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,894
I remember my first time in the Wild West.

94
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,851
I drove a real-life desperado out of town.

95
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,267
- That's cool. Mmm-hmm.
- And that was my hat, thanks.

96
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,939
Hmm.

97
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,407
That's cool.

98
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,658
RAY: What's this?

99
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,537
Oh, uh, that's nothing, don't open it.
You don't have to open...

100
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,867
You opened it.

101
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,158
RAY: Did you draw
your own superhero costume?

102
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,994
No. Absolutely not.

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,379
Yeah, I did.
And I only did because when I steel up,

104
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,461
my clothes stretch out
and they fit all weird.

105
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,500
And besides, don't I deserve a suit?

106
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,886
I mean, am I just the research guy here?

107
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,388
Look, I know what it's like
to be a rookie.

108
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,970
Just, uh, follow my lead
and you'll be fine out there.

109
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,554
Well, I know a few things
about the Old West.

110
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,015
Like, for instance...
Nobody says "Howdy."

111
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,397
- Uh-huh.
- And you know how to ride a horse, right?

112
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,103
- Yeah, I can figure it out.
- Ah.

113
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,392
This loaded?

114
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,731
Yes, it is.

115
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,894
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,793
DR. HEYWOOD: Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,584
Guys, I think my horse is broken.

118
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,675
Where's the professor?

119
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,465
Uh, he's feeling a little off.

120
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,091
More whiskey for me.

121
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,885
MAN: <i>Yee-haw!</i>

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,058
Sounds like a commotion of some kind.

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,346
Hold back, let's get a better look.

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,527
HEAD BANDIT: Look at him up there, boys.

125
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,032
Oh! It's a hanging.

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,203
Is that Hex?

127
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,742
You know that man?

128
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,407
We gotta help him.

129
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,204
Well, we gotta take his crew out first.

130
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,914
- They look armed.
- Don't worry, guys.

131
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,169
I got this.

132
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,330
What?

133
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,089
Well, well, well, you look a lot less mean
with that noose around your neck,

134
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,377
don't you, Hex?

135
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,636
You think this is finished?

136
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,389
Looking pretty finished to me,
don't you think, boys, huh?

137
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,764
You son of a bitch!

138
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,524
You might wanna slow down there.

139
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,602
Because these here parts
ain't big enough for the...

140
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,484
Five of us.

141
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,741
- Who the hell are you?
- What he said.

142
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,909
HEAD BANDIT: On second thought,
I don't give a damn!

143
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,929
Hold still, Hex.

144
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,651
Nice shot.

145
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>Now you get on that horse</i>

146
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,245
and you ride till you feel like
you can't ride any further,

147
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,290
then you ride some more. Now, go on, get.
Go on. Whoo!

148
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,754
Face.

149
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,293
What?

150
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,962
Nothin'.

151
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,009
Oh, hell.

152
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,895
They're back.

153
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,438
Saved by a filly.
Ain't that the damnedest.

154
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,068
A simple thank you would suffice.

155
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,695
How'd you know I needed savin'?

156
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,607
Because we got an alert
that history was being changed,

157
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,400
and the coordinates lead us
to your hanging.

158
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,327
Well, I guess it's nice
to know that I matter.

159
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,580
Leaving already?
I didn't get to shoot anyone.

160
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,036
I need a drink.

161
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,623
Where's Rip?

162
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,585
He's MIA.

163
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,548
Damn.

164
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,090
How the hell do you miscreants manage
not to get yourselves killed without him?

165
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,096
Ms. Lance has been serving as captain.

166
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,850
But she's a lady.

167
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,140
You are a lady, right?

168
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,398
You know I could take your life
just as easily as I saved it.

169
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,225
Ooh. Fiery.

170
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,936
Whoever breaks her is in for a wild ride.

171
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,481
Too bad this filly is into other fillies.

172
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,075
Mmm. You don't say.

173
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,285
So, how did you end up in the noose?

174
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,039
I was collecting a bounty on a pissant
by the name of Quentin Turnbull.

175
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,076
- As in Turnbull Country?
- Never heard of it.

176
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,915
That's because it's not supposed to exist.

177
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,672
This book has changed
since the last time I saw it.

178
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,798
- Check this out. Gideon.
- GIDEON: <i>Right away.</i>

179
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,760
That's a map of the United States
from 1876.

180
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,304
SARA: <i>All right, who's Turnbull?</i>

181
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,386
Two-bit, yellow-bellied cattle rustler.

182
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,176
Who controls all the land
west of the Rocky Mountains.

183
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,437
Looks like we found our Aberration.

184
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,939
Am I supposed to have the faintest idea
what the hell this means?

185
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,477
It means that we need to stop Turnbull
from taking over the West.

186
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,691
Looks like you got yourself
a posse, partner.

187
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,241
JAX: <i>Where is everybody?</i>

188
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,781
JONAH: Ever since Turnbull set up shop
six months ago,

189
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,248
everyone's been run out of town
or made to work in the mine.

190
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,377
Mine? What kind of mine? Gold?

191
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,629
JONAH: Hell if I know.

192
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,008
Nobody's been mining for gold
in these parts for half a century.

193
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,586
Listen to me. "These parts."
I sound like I'm a cowboy.

194
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,720
He's pulling something outta the ground
that's making him rich.

195
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,222
Turnbull also owns this saloon.

196
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,351
The hotel, the laundry and the whorehouse.

197
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,977
The answer's no, Mick.

198
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,562
Turnbull's got an office above the saloon.

199
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,226
He's also got about a dozen men
making sure nobody gets close to him.

200
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,985
I think I know how we can.

201
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,569
Mick.

202
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,648
Why don't you mosey on in there?
Have yourself a good time.

203
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,907
If you insist.

204
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,659
Not sure I understand your plan.

205
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,445
You just set a match to a powder keg.

206
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,621
And if Turnbull doesn't want
his saloon to burn down,

207
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,078
then he's going to have to
come out of his office and deal with it.

208
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,118
Better yet, get your boy
to get in a fight with Turnbull

209
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,582
and bring him out here on the street.

210
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,964
Amaya, your job is to make sure
Rory keeps his pistol in his pants

211
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,249
until he's outside the saloon.

212
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,543
Clearly, I drew the short straw.

213
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,303
So, what you want us to do?

214
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,347
Reckon I can post up nearby
with a long gun.

215
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,594
- Are you chewing tobacco?
- Mm. Tootsie Roll.

216
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,977
Get rid of your hats and your guns.

217
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,391
What? I thought we were supposed to be
some badass cowboys.

218
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,652
You guys wanna know how
Turnbull went from being a cattle rustler

219
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,811
<i>to running his own country?</i>

220
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,777
I'm gonna need you
to infiltrate his base of operations.

221
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,528
As what?

222
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,661
Y'all are tax collectors?

223
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,539
We're here to go over your books
and make sure everything's in order.

224
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,416
And we're in a bit of a hurry, so, uh...

225
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,294
Yes, we're on the next train
back to Washington, D.C.

226
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,423
Well, there ain't no train to Washington.

227
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,675
The pass won't be open till spring.

228
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,506
He means mule train.

229
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,046
- Mmm-hmm.
- This guy.

230
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,516
How'd I go from desperado to accountant?

231
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,551
Well, at least Mick's having fun.

232
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,972
Stuck here doing research
while everyone else is out drinking.

233
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,856
It's like high school all over again.

234
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,352
Shot.

235
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,484
Make it two.

236
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,111
You're with him?

237
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,239
Unfortunately.

238
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,956
Guys, I think I found something.

239
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,420
According to this ledger,

240
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,462
Turnbull is stockpiling some kind of ore
in a nearby mining camp.

241
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,057
And you are?

242
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,388
I work for Mr. Turnbull.

243
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,769
<i>Who are you?</i>

244
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,564
My friends and I are with
the Internal Revenue...

245
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,271
Uh, Mr. Turnbull don't like no taxmen.

246
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,561
Well, nobody likes paying taxes,

247
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,150
but they are an essential part
of the federal government's...

248
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,112
Mr. Turnbull don't like
the federal government neither.

249
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,409
Is that why
he's trying to start his own country?

250
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,119
Well, now, see, Why'd you have to go
and say something like that?

251
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,159
Now I got to pump some lead into you,

252
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,874
so you don't go blabbing
to the wrong person.

253
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,124
Hey, hey, would you shoot an unarmed man?

254
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,717
I think that's a yes.

255
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,722
So, what's your history with Turnbull?

256
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,769
JONAH: Come again?

257
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,600
Well, you said that you had
dealings over the years.

258
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,985
I can tell a vendetta when I see one.

259
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,067
I'm kind of an expert
when it comes to revenge.

260
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,442
Is this what it's like
working with a woman?

261
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,153
You just sit around
and talk about your feelings.

262
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,367
Well, if your feelings
are what almost got you hung, then yeah,

263
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,538
I'd say they are worth talking about.

264
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,412
Not in my century.

265
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,797
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Now that we've got
outlaw outfits, it's time to</i>

266
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,085
find out what Turnbull's stockpiling
at his mining camp.

267
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,842
Or we can do the responsible thing
and head back to the ship

268
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,005
with the rest of the team.

269
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,349
You're joking, right?

270
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,184
Time to cowboy up.

271
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,779
Ah!

272
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,452
- Another blackjack.
- Must be my lucky day.

273
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,246
- You're cheating.
- I'm winning.

274
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,578
Sweetheart, that's for you.
I'll see you around.

275
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,461
Piano man, play something else.

276
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,925
I've had more fun at a funeral.

277
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,552
Bartender!

278
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,095
And who might you be?

279
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,383
Name's Turnbull.

280
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,642
Never heard of him.

281
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,813
That's my name on the sign
in front of the saloon.

282
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,975
Or can't you read?

283
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,269
So, it's your money I'm winning.

284
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,153
Well, that's interesting.

285
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,413
I'd say your luck has run out, partner.

286
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,042
You just going to stand there
and make threats?

287
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,078
Or are you gonna back it up?

288
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,999
SARA: <i>Amaya, what's going on in there?</i>

289
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,843
You wanted Rory to start a fight?

290
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,050
I'd say your plan's working.

291
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,016
JAX: Man, these clothes smell like ass.

292
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
People didn't wash in the Wild, Wild West?

293
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,816
RAY: Well, we're criminals, remember?
It's important to smell the part.

294
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,019
DR. HEYWOOD:
Game faces, boys. We got company.

295
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,315
I don't recognize you three.

296
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,863
That's probably 'cause of
our new bandanas.

297
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,787
This one off his rocker?

298
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,624
RAY: You could blow his brains out.
Only he doesn't got any.

299
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,592
DR. HEYWOOD: Nice work.

300
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,048
Gideon, let's run
the neuro-imaging scan again.

301
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,841
There must be something you missed.

302
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,763
GIDEON: <i>The odds that I misdiagnosed
your condition are infinitesimally thin.</i>

303
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,647
<i>The algorithm programmed
into my medical diagnostics system...</i>

304
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,023
Please just do it.

305
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,685
<i>As you wish, Professor.</i>

306
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:29,073
<i>Biometric scan reveals all brain functions
are within normal parameters.</i>

307
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>Physiologically,
there's nothing wrong with you.</i>

308
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,503
Are you implying that my symptoms
are psychosomatic? Because...

309
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,128
Please.

310
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,715
I need you to run the tests again.

311
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,567
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

312
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,656
It's dwarf star.

313
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,121
One of the rarest minerals
in the universe.

314
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,408
How does this help Turnbull
take over the West?

315
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,077
I used dwarf star to power the Atom suit.

316
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,042
The piece I had
was the size of your little finger.

317
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,004
There's enough potential energy here
to power the entire Wild West.

318
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,880
Or blow it up.

319
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,596
Question is,
how does Turnbull even know what it is?

320
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,639
I bet you
this has something to do with it.

321
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,321
It's some sort of tracker,
definitely not from the 1800s.

322
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,152
Probably stole it from a time pirate.

323
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,112
- We got to get this out of here.
- Yeah.

324
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,031
Oh.

325
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,619
I should have mentioned it's also
the densest material in the universe.

326
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,167
Let's get the rest of the team.

327
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,791
Amaya, it's been forever.
What the hell is going on in there?

328
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,748
The plan's caught something of a snag.

329
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,048
Explain.

330
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,584
<i>Well, it's hard to.</i>

331
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,675
But Mr. Rory and Mr. Turnbull...

332
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,635
like each other.

333
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,976
SARA: <i>What? What happened
to Rory starting a fight?</i>

334
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,230
I think it's more likely that him
and Turnbull get matching tattoos.

335
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,015
Then they told me to put my hands up,

336
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,185
and my pants fell down
because of all the loot I was carrying.

337
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:29,192
You see, that's what them damn fools
in government back in Washington

338
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,985
don't understand,
that men like you and me,

339
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,120
we wasn't meant to live in cages.

340
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,915
Hell, that's why our forbearers
busted away from England to begin with,

341
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,120
so we could be free.

342
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,623
And that's what Turnbull Country
is all about.

343
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,629
It's about keeping the Wild West wild.

344
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,960
I'll drink to that.

345
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,549
Hey, have some of that.

346
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,599
Are you gonna sit around
while those two bend elbows?

347
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,682
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna collect my bounty.

348
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,891
Whether you like it or not.

349
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,431
Stick to the plan, Jonah.

350
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,349
Your guy on the inside
ain't sticking to no plan.

351
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,812
Why the hell should I?

352
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,105
AMAYA: <i>Sara? What do you want me to do?</i>

353
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,611
Brace yourself.

354
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,032
Turnbull!

355
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,579
Well, if it ain't
the great Jonah Hex himself.

356
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,133
<i>Whoo! You've got quite a pair
to walk into my establishment like this.</i>

357
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,010
You're like a cockroach, hard to kill.

358
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,554
I'm taking you in,

359
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,219
alive or dead.

360
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,508
Your choice.

361
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,095
I choose dead.

362
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,777
Actually, Jonah...

363
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,647
I'm glad you decided
to pay me this little visit.

364
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,320
You see, I've been...

365
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,118
working on a little something.

366
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,488
It seems that ore that I discovered,

367
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,828
well, it's got special qualities.

368
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,722
Let's party!

369
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,909
Come on!

370
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,665
Why do you guys get to have all the fun?

371
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,710
We just got back from Turnbull's mine.

372
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,380
Reason for the Aberration?
He's digging up dwarf star.

373
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,345
Get back to the ship.

374
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,187
That's right, run,
you yellow-bellied cowards!

375
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,862
Finally some excitement.

376
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,112
Mick, no!

377
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,733
And here I thought you and me
was gonna be friends.

378
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,864
I don't have friends.

379
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,054
- AMAYA: Nate? Nate, are you okay?
- Yeah.

380
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,215
- I'm the man of steel, remember?
- Oh, my God.

381
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,233
Gideon, prepare to run diagnostics.

382
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,485
What's to run? I've been shot.

383
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,567
GIDEON: <i>The bullet has lodged itself</i>

384
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,732
<i>between several of
Dr. Heywood's internal organs.</i>

385
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,196
How's that possible? He's made of steel.

386
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,576
SARA: <i>Because it wasn't a normal bullet.</i>

387
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,407
It was dwarf star.

388
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,414
GIDEON: <i>I estimate
his chance of survival at 51%.</i>

389
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,626
Would it kill you to say,
"Better than average," Gideon?

390
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,585
We had a plan. You went off book.

391
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,095
Now, you're gonna cut the crap

392
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,258
and tell me what the hell is going on
between you and Turnbull.

393
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,225
I don't answer to you, Ms. Lance.

394
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,636
<i>It's Captain Lance.</i>

395
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,807
And if you did answer to me,
Nate wouldn't have gotten shot.

396
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,894
Now, I know you don't like
taking orders from a woman.

397
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,406
But you're gonna like getting
your ass kicked by one even less.

398
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,161
I've been after Turnbull
for eight years now.

399
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,626
<i>I almost got him twice.</i>

400
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,959
He wants to see me pushing up daisies

401
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,624
just as bad
as I want to see him do the same.

402
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,300
Because of what?

403
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,339
There's a town in Oklahoma.

404
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,805
Goes by the name of Calvert.

405
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,808
Turnbull and his men were harassing it.

406
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,136
They hired me to fight back.

407
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,814
Calvert. That's the town
that Rip left in the lurch.

408
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,769
My little rebellion made other towns think

409
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,484
they didn't need to pay protection money
to Turnbull and his gang.

410
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,989
<i>So, one night,</i>

411
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,283
Turnbull gathered every man,
woman and child in Calvert.

412
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,326
Locked us in a church, set it on fire.

413
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,204
Somehow, I escaped.

414
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,710
The Lord saw fit
to leave me with this souvenir.

415
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,218
What the hell am I telling
a woman this for?

416
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,804
You'd never understand.

417
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,683
Wrong.

418
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,309
Like I said, vendetta is kind of my thing.

419
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,196
I've got a Turnbull,
and he's still out there.

420
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,362
Well, here you are with a Timeship.

421
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,867
<i>Been there, tried that.</i>

422
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,871
Killing Darhk would create
ripples in history that I can't control.

423
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,741
But there are things that I can control.

424
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,540
I can help you capture Turnbull.

425
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,673
Even though I screwed up?

426
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,383
Been there, too.

427
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,722
I'm starting to think that screwing up
is just an essential part of surviving.

428
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,688
So, how's your headache?

429
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,564
Oh, it's fine.
Nothing a little aspirin couldn't help.

430
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,070
Funny, that's not what Gideon told me.

431
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,072
What's going on?

432
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,734
And don't lie
because you know I can always tell.

433
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,781
All right, while you were away,
I had a vision.

434
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,408
A vision? Like a hallucination?

435
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,420
It's possible it could merely be
a side effect from multiple time jumps.

436
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,208
Whoa. Grey. Grey.

437
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,384
JAX: <i>Grey?</i>

438
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,884
That is not a reaction to time travel.
What did you just see?

439
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,889
A woman.

440
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,433
Someone I've never met, but her face,

441
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,102
it keeps flashing in my mind,

442
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,485
like I'm having memories of a stranger,

443
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,443
but she's not really a stranger.

444
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,444
I haven't the slightest notion why.

445
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,120
Trying to work out your frustration?

446
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,756
Something like that.

447
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,634
What happened out there today?

448
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,637
You lost control.

449
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,181
Says you.

450
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,644
That man back in town, the drinker,
the gambler, the animal

451
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,144
that wants to watch the whole world burn,

452
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,851
that's the real me.

453
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,151
I happen to know a thing or two
about animals.

454
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,994
They're not vicious by nature
unless they're attacked.

455
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,665
If you're trying to tell me
to tell you some sob story

456
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:19,044
about how horrible
and painful my life is, forget it.

457
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,459
I'm no victim.

458
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,548
Sara's told me all the things
that you've done for this team.

459
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,174
And you don't sound like an animal
who just wants to watch the world burn.

460
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,807
They like to pretend I'm part of the team,
that they have me on a leash.

461
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,685
No.

462
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,524
Hmm?

463
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,358
Now, if you'll excuse me.

464
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,830
Some superhero.

465
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,039
Maybe I am better suited for the library.

466
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,828
Ow.

467
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,001
Don't be so hard on yourself.

468
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,917
You had no idea that Turnbull
laced the bullets with dwarf star

469
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,051
or that you're even vulnerable to it.

470
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:15,514
When I was a kid,
there was this bully, Shane Blocklin.

471
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:20,556
And one day, I decided
I'm going to stand up to little Shane.

472
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,894
<i>Long story short,
he breaks my nose in two places.</i>

473
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,239
But from that point on, I was, uh...

474
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,692
I was different.

475
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,362
I was afraid.

476
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,914
And then I meet you guys,
and I get these superpowers

477
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,412
and I say to myself,

478
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,918
"Nate, you don't have
to feel afraid again."

479
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,427
Well, maybe now you know how I felt
after you destroyed my Atom suit.

480
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,938
When we were out fighting with the Shogun,
without my suit, I was afraid.

481
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,731
Well, you hid it well.

482
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,603
It's because I realized that weakness

483
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,272
or not being invulnerable
is what makes me a hero.

484
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,904
There's no bravery without fear.

485
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,616
That was a really good
inspirationalspeech.

486
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,906
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
- Yeah.

487
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,621
Well, I have a few other aphorisms
in my back pocket.

488
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:26,129
Like, uh, "Courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of fear."

489
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,623
<i>Strength is...</i>

490
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,087
You know what, buddy? You nailed it.

491
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,633
Sorry. Got a little carried away
with my train of...

492
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,593
That's it!

493
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,467
I think I know how
Turnbull's gonna make his own country.

494
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,647
When I saw how much dwarf star ore
he had in that mine, I started to wonder,

495
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,478
how could he transport
such a heavy shipment?

496
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,268
- He'd have to use...
- The railroad.

497
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,481
The railroad.

498
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,816
Okay. Get to the part where we care, Ray.

499
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,778
I think he's gonna use the railroad
and the dwarf star to... Wait for it.

500
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,284
I don't want to wait for it.

501
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,490
Close Summit Pass.

502
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,287
- DR. HEYWOOD: Oh, my God, Ray is right.
- Thank you.

503
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,498
Summit Pass connects east and west
via railroad.

504
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:09,165
But not if Turnbull uses this magic...

505
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,459
- Dwarf star?
- Yeah, to blow the thing up.

506
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,882
Well, if he destroys the pass,

507
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,969
there's no way of transporting
soldiers and supplies from the East Coast.

508
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,180
The US Army is effectively
locked out of the West.

509
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,344
<i>So, it's simple.</i>

510
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,515
We just stop Turnbull
from blowing up the pass.

511
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,682
SARA: <i>Yeah, it's simple.</i>

512
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,519
You don't have a suit,
you just had invasive surgery,

513
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,028
Stein's out of commission.

514
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,863
We'll think of something.

515
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:38,695
"Courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of it."

516
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,538
Yeah. What about Turnbull?

517
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,705
That train goes boom,
he's not gonna be on it.

518
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,164
I overheard one of his people saying

519
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,580
Turnbull just called
for a meeting at his mine.

520
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,340
You, Jax, and Ray stop the train.
The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.

521
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,387
You sure about this?

522
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,714
Of course.

523
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,888
This isn't my first rodeo.

524
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,935
I wanted to say that.

525
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,736
RAY: <i>There's our train.</i>

526
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,566
Loaded with enough dwarf star
to punch a hole in the mountain

527
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,405
and cut off the pass to the east.

528
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,240
How do we stop a moving locomotive?

529
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,570
We don't.

530
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,780
I do.

531
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,283
I think.

532
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,083
- So, what do you think?
- I think I liked him.

533
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,806
There's three of them for every one of us.

534
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,352
Hex and I will draw their attention
while you two go make sure

535
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,812
Turnbull can't pull any more dwarf star
out of the ground.

536
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,774
We'll need about five minutes
to plant enough dynamite to seal the mine.

537
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,938
About time we got to light something up.

538
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,033
Just light the fuse and run,
don't stick around for the fireworks.

539
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,276
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,991
All right, I got a plan
to get us close to Turnbull.

541
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,031
You ready to follow my orders this time?

542
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,287
Aye, aye, Captain.

543
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,460
- Good. Now put these on.
- Hmm.

544
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,138
Quentin Turnbull.

545
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,881
Who's asking?

546
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,634
I heard you're looking for someone.

547
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,392
Jonah Hex.

548
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:34,185
Well, hell, looks like I'm gonna
have to kill you for the third time.

549
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,569
I'm impressed, boy.

550
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,651
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

551
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,158
Back in the belly of the whale.

552
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,241
The lily-livered whale
who kills women and children.

553
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,165
Oh, no, that was before. I've changed.
I got purpose now.

554
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,500
Matter of fact,
why don't I show you what I'm working on

555
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,336
so you know why you died.

556
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,717
You come along too, boy.

557
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,670
Anyone who can bring in Hex
always got a place on my crew.

558
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,728
Nate, what are you doing, man?

559
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,942
- Hold on.
- Keep your distance.

560
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,440
JAX: <i>What are you going to do?</i>

561
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,610
I'm going to cut 'em off at the pass.
I've always wanted to say that.

562
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,028
RAY: You can't get in front
of a moving train.

563
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,619
You said it yourself,
there's no bravery without fear.

564
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,081
Which is good
because I am scared as hell right now.

565
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,286
Yah!

566
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,878
TURNBULL: Colt Single Action Army,
the gun that won the West.

567
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,715
Some folks like to call it The Peacemaker.

568
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,717
Only I don't much care for peace.

569
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,466
Yeah, thanks to what I pulled out
of this mine,

570
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,305
I got my own weapon now.

571
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,227
Something that's gonna tip the scales.

572
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,889
Win the West back
for the folks it belongs to,

573
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,641
the outlaws.

574
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,679
- Okay. I'm in position.
- RAY: <i>And out of your mind.</i>

575
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,684
JAX: <i>You couldn't even stop
a bullet made with that stuff.</i>

576
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,438
<i>That train is loaded with dwarf star, man.</i>

577
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,640
You guys aren't helping.

578
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,519
You've got a whole minute
to get out of here.

579
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,487
You mean we have a minute?

580
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,648
<i>That's what I meant.</i>

581
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,280
Should we tell them about the minute?

582
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,030
- No.
- Good.

583
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,953
I was hoping you were going to say that.

584
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,177
Who's next?

585
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,717
Mick, we gotta go.

586
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,177
Mick, now.

587
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,188
Put the animal away.

588
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,516
Okay.

589
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,656
Hell, those bullets ain't nothing.
Wait till you see what I got now.

590
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,240
Now, get on in there.

591
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,207
You ain't no man!

592
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,343
You burned down Calvert.

593
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,678
You murdered all those people.

594
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,930
For what?

595
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,386
For power?

596
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,934
Go on, get it over with.

597
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,104
Alive or dead?

598
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,401
Alive...

599
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,282
You lucky son of a bitch.

600
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,705
I got this. I got this. I got this.

601
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,578
I got this, I got this, I got this,
I got this.

602
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,416
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Did you see that?</i>

603
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,911
Did you see that? Tell me you saw that.

604
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,082
- Yo, that was badass, dude.
- Totally badass.

605
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,791
- You all right?
- No.

606
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,630
But I stopped a train.

607
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
JAX: <i>I think he's good.</i>

608
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,342
Whoo!

609
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,007
I stopped the train!

610
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,682
RAY: Whoo!

611
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,938
It's a mighty fine job you did back there,

612
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,061
Captain.

613
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,156
I'll drink to that.

614
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,663
So, now that you have your man,
what are you going to do with him?

615
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:43,919
Turnbull? If I had my way,
he'd be in for a long, painful demise.

616
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,415
I'd let him bleed out from the gut.

617
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,171
But I'm gonna turn him over
to the authorities.

618
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,510
So you don't have to worry
about your Aberration.

619
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,308
Only territory
Turnbull's gonna be claiming

620
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,764
is a cold, dark prison cell.

621
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,347
Then our work here is done.

622
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,318
You do a mighty fine job
bearing a burden few men can deal with.

623
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,191
Good thing I'm a woman then.

624
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:14,983
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,200
I best get Turnbull.

626
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,332
Collect my bounty.

627
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,671
Now, you try to stay out of trouble.

628
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,214
Not likely.

629
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,339
I wouldn't imagine so.

630
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,495
AMAYA: <i>It really is beautiful.</i>

631
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,008
It's no wonder that human beings
have worshipped fire for millennia.

632
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,501
Fire gives us life,

633
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,677
but also has the power
to destroy everything in its path.

634
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,095
Your point?

635
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,553
Or are you gonna keep talking
in metaphors?

636
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,724
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

637
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,351
But don't tell them.

638
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,028
You were right.

639
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,573
The animal who wants
to watch the world burn,

640
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,908
that is who you are.

641
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,238
But it's not all that you are.

642
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,414
Your point?

643
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,084
<i>Don't deny the animal.</i>

644
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,415
But don't let it control you either.

645
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,581
<i>I can help you.</i>

646
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,209
Believe me,

647
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,423
I know a thing or two
about controlling wild beasts.

648
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,478
JAX: <i>Oh! There you are.</i>

649
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,272
So I've been thinking
about your memory flashes,

650
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,657
manopause moments
or whatever it is you want to call 'em.

651
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,321
I got a theory.

652
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,613
What if when you interacted
with your younger self in 1987, you...

653
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:30,001
Inadvertently changed my past,
so that my memories from my new life

654
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,957
are supplanting the memories
from my old life,

655
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,918
thus creating temporal dissonance.

656
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,834
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

657
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,971
That's a brilliant theory
which I happen to share with you,

658
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,298
but it doesn't explain...

659
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,466
Who the mystery lady is.

660
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,523
Or that I'm fairly certain.

661
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,445
I love her.

662
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,653
Man, Clarissa is gonna kill you
when you get home.

663
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,706
Assuming there even is a Clarissa
to go home to.

664
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,214
Hah!

665
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,542
Hey. Heard you were looking for me.

666
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:23,179
Oh, yeah. Uh, I just want to thank you
for saving all that dwarf star ore.

667
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,340
I have enough to power 20 Atom suits now.

668
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,383
That's cool, man. So, we all get one?

669
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,223
Actually, there's something
I've been working on

670
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,183
before I start building a new exo-suit.

671
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,022
Hmm.

672
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,981
It's not exactly what was in your drawing,
I made a few improvements.

673
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,491
- Shut the front door.
- Yeah.

674
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,318
<i>I figured you earned it,</i>

675
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,532
Steel.

676
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,196
Cool name.

677
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,867
Hey, you guys done broing out?

678
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,160
I mean, uh, not really, but...

679
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,541
- We can.
<i>- Good.</i>

680
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,832
Because our friends back in 2016,
they need our help.
