1
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,684
Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

2
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,187
- God.
- Keep pressure on it.

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,522
- It's not slowing.
- Keep putting pressure on it.

4
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,067
- More pressure. Get the napkins.
- Come on.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,818
- More napkins.
- Shit.

6
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,362
- It's not slowing.
- Argyle! Get us to St. Mary's.

7
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,740
I don't think praying's
gonna help that dude.

8
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,784
- No, you idiot! St. Mary's Hospital.
- No, no.

9
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,411
- What?
- No hospital.

10
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:40,582
- We're gonna get you to the hospital.
- You need to warn...

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,959
...O... Owens.

12
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,710
- Owens, okay.
- The girl.

13
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:46,670
She... She's in danger.

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,673
Okay, how... how do we find Owens?

15
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,674
Nina. Nina.

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,844
- Nina. Who's Nina?
- Come on. A pen.

17
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,344
- Okay.
- Shit.

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,514
- Here's the number.
- Number. Number.

19
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,034
- He wants to write something.
- We can call this Nina?

20
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,728
Grab a magazine or something.
Will, get something.

21
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,022
- He's really bleeding a lot.
- Right here.

22
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,106
- Come on. Hey.
- Write the number.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,733
Hey! Look at me!

24
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,319
- Hey! Come on!
- Hold on!

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,986
- Oh, shit.
- Hey!

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,114
Hey, yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait.

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,075
Why is it so quiet back there, huh?

28
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,703
Yo, is he dead? Jesus, man.

29
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,996
Talk to me! Shit!

30
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,707
We should get off the road.

31
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,378
Argyle, Ar... Argyle, get off the road, now!

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,921
Shit, he's dead, isn't he?

33
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,091
- This is real bad.
- What are you doing?

34
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,966
Get off the road!

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,430
Listen.

36
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,742
I know she was just here.

37
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,102
And if you wanna live...

38
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,105
you're gonna tell me where she is.

39
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,546
Apologies for the bumpy ride, kiddo.

40
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,175
I would've paved the road, but...

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,554
kinda ruins the whole
"top secret location" thing.

42
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,723
Did you get some rest?

43
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,058
A little.

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
Good.

45
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,313
I have a feeling you're gonna need it.

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,639
Oop.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,185
Okay. Here we go.

48
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,863
You didn't really think
we were working out of a shed, did you?

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,595
You built all this?

50
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,514
Well, more gave it a face-lift.

51
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,934
Do you know what an ICBM is?

52
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,562
It stands for
intercontinental ballistic missile.

53
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,439
It's a... a fancy bomb.

54
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,569
We used to store them in these silos,
but we haven't used this one in years.

55
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,821
In fact, there...
there's no bomb here at all.

56
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,824
It's just a big ol' empty space.

57
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:29,036
So we repurposed it to hold something
much more powerful than a missile:

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,079
you.

59
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:36,377
- Anne, Tracy. Morning.
- Morning, doc.

60
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,545
Morning.

61
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:41,423
You'll have to forgive the staring.
You're a bit of a celebrity down here.

62
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,175
- I am?
- Oh yeah. You kidding?

63
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,137
You... You're bigger than Madonna to them.

64
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:50,016
They've all given up their lives,
their jobs, their families

65
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,310
to come work on this program,
'cause they believe in the cause.

66
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,021
They believe in you.

67
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,737
It's okay. Yeah.

68
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,326
We call her Nina.

69
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
What is it?

70
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,877
If we told you,
it would ruin the surprise.

71
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,346
Hello, Eleven.

72
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I know.

73
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,893
You're frightened of me.

74
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,439
Perhaps, in our time apart,
you may have even grown to hate me.

75
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,526
But all I've ever wanted to do

76
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,485
is to help you.

77
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,906
And right now,
I think you very much need my help.

78
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
Your gifts have been stolen.

79
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,829
I believe I know why.

80
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,332
And I believe I know how to get them back.

81
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,461
Let us work together again.

82
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,755
You and I.

83
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,966
Daughter

84
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,802
and Papa.

85
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,971
Papa!

86
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,694
Yeah, I got her.

87
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,411
Why don't you go back inside?
Play nice for the doctor, hmm?

88
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:36,745
No!

89
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:38,665
No!

90
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,086
The more you move,

91
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,465
- the more this is gonna hurt.
- No! No! No!

92
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,007
Leave her.

93
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,889
- No.
- I'm... I'm sorry, Eleven.

94
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,393
This is not how I wanted things to begin.

95
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,689
But everything's going to be all right.

96
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,524
You're home now.

97
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,028
You're home.

98
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,957
Enough!

99
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,794
He is not yours to kill.

100
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,047
Fools.

101
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,636
What I tell you, American?

102
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,931
No run.

103
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,808
You don't listen.

104
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,147
Now is going to be much pain.

105
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,357
Much.

106
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,610
It could be worse, American.

107
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,778
At least you have company.

108
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,828
Your eyes don't deceive you.

109
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm a prisoner now.

110
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,581
Like you.

111
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,628
Yuri, the smuggler, he betrayed me.

112
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,546
Betrayed us.

113
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,634
The pig's in trouble now.

114
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,011
You said we could trust him!

115
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,304
You swore to me!

116
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,307
Because I believed we could.

117
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,225
You think this is what I planned?

118
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,019
I have lost everything. Everything!

119
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,270
We both knew the risks. Both of us.

120
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,481
Do us all a favor. Finish him!

121
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,274
We gambled today,

122
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:34,775
and we lost.

123
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,363
We lost.

124
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,950
Finish him!

125
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,293
Joyce.

126
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,919
What about Joyce?

127
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,067
There you are, my girl!

128
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,152
Mwah!

129
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,326
Why the long faces?

130
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,914
Are you not excited for your journey
across the Iron Curtain?

131
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,794
Yuri, I have a family.
I have three kids waiting for me.

132
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,923
Did you know?
Peanut butter is banned in motherland.

133
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,467
I buy for dollar-thirty here,

134
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,595
sell for $20 there.

135
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,846
Your mother must be very proud.

136
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,765
My mother is dead.

137
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,518
Dead...

138
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,312
tired of living like a bum!

139
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,774
You see?

140
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,650
Yuri has family too.

141
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,904
And with money I earn from selling you,

142
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,447
I will buy her a new house.

143
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,073
I will buy my daughter

144
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,784
a pony.

145
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,620
Whatever they desire from now on,
they will have.

146
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,581
And, yes, for that,

147
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:13,708
my mother will be very, very proud.

00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,580
<i>Dustin, can you hear me?</i>

168
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>Dustin?</i>

169
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,336
<i>Earth to Dustin.</i>

170
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,546
Hey, it's Nancy.

171
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,590
Wheeler! Hey.

172
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,009
Um, I'm gonna need a food delivery,

173
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,429
<i>like, really soon, unless you want me
going out into the world.</i>

174
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,307
No. No, no, no. Don't do that.

175
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,309
<i>Stay where you are,
and we'll be there as soon as we can.</i>

176
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

177
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:58,355
Listen, um... can you pick me up a six-pack?

178
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:01,482
I know, it's stupid as shit,
drinking right now,

179
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,195
<i>but a cold beer
would really calm my jangled nerves.</i>

180
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,822
Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back.

181
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,866
No, don't you da... Wheeler? Wheeler?

182
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,868
- Dustin!
- Mm.

183
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
- Wake up.
- What?

184
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,787
Aren't you supposed to be on Max watch?

185
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,955
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

186
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,248
- Sorry.
- Then where is she?

187
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,250
She's right there. A second ago.

188
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,418
I swear, I just dozed off for...

189
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,713
...an hour.

190
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,096
Morning, guys.

191
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,307
Everything okay?

192
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,389
Yeah.

193
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,477
Yeah, everything's okay.

194
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,981
I think it's so sweet that you guys
are sticking together like this.

195
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
Could try sticking together
at a different house for a change.

196
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:49,782
You know you're welcome anytime.

197
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,951
Totally. You're like family.

198
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,577
- May I?
- Absolutely.

199
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,206
Yeah, why not?
Take us for all we're worth.

200
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:58,956
Okay.

201
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,755
<i>♪ You wanna feel how it feels? ♪</i>

202
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>- ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪
- ♪ You wanna know ♪</i>

203
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,469
Hey.

204
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,552
Hey.

205
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:13,972
You okay?

206
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,807
Just couldn't sleep.

207
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,352
People kept blasting music in my ears,
for some reason.

208
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,481
But Holly let me borrow
some of her crayons.

209
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,985
- We've been having fun, right, Holly?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,864
Is this what you saw last night?

211
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,075
I mean, it's supposed to be.

212
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:37,120
I thought it'd be easier to draw it out
than to explain it, but...

213
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,371
not so much.

214
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,790
Is that...?

215
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,668
It was like they were on display.

216
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:47,088
And then there was
this red fog everywhere.

217
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,631
It was like a dream.

218
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,049
A nightmare.

219
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,302
You think Vecna's
just trying to scare you?

220
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:53,761
With Billy? Yeah.

221
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,264
But when I made it here...

222
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:57,890
I dunno, something was different.

223
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,768
He seemed surprised, almost.

224
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,644
Like he didn't want me there.

225
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,980
Maybe you infiltrated his mind.

226
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,606
He invaded your mind, right?

227
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,693
Is it that big a leap to suggest
you somehow wound up in his?

228
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:10,945
Like Freddie Krueger's boiler room.

229
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,364
Freddie Krueger?

230
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,951
He's a super burned-up dude
with razors for fingers.

231
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,287
- And he kills you in your dreams.
- Seriously?

232
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,915
Sorry. It's a movie.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,125
It's not real.

234
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,170
Just... think about it.

235
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:29,964
What if you somehow
unlocked a backdoor to Vecna's world?

236
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,259
Like, maybe the answer
we're looking for is

237
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,471
somewhere in this
incredibly vague drawing.

238
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,265
- God, we need Will.
- No shit.

239
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:42,102
But I tried them again this morning,
and it's the same busy signal.

240
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,145
Is this a window?

241
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,355
Yeah.

242
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,898
Stained glass with roses.

243
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:49,358
Yeah. See? I'm not so terrible after all.

244
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,863
Yeah, well, it helps
that I've seen it before.

245
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,229
It's pieces of a house.

246
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,146
Not just any house.

247
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,825
It's Victor Creel's house.

248
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:39,867
Where you going?

249
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,369
Waking the others.

250
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,665
Sorry, fuel for the road.
Thanks, Mr. Wheeler!

251
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,730
No.

252
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,278
No.

253
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,259
No.

254
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,696
Well, well.

255
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,907
Look who finally decided to join us.

256
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,287
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

257
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,788
Where am I?

258
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,039
I guess you're still not quite awake, huh?

259
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,375
Am I in Hawkins?

260
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,759
Well, well.

261
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:46,305
Look who finally decided to join us.

262
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,143
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

263
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,528
Don't go too far, sleepyhead.

264
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:04,405
Lessons begin promptly at 10:00.

265
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,848
Well, well.

266
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:34,102
Look who finally decided to join us.

267
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:37,772
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

268
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,236
Heart rate's now 120 BPM.

269
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,324
- She's rejecting it.
- Give her time.

270
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,243
No, no, no. We shouldn't have
just thrown her in like this.

271
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:53,497
- She's gonna drown in there.
- No.

272
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:56,165
No, she is going to swim.

273
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,969
Oh man.

274
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:13,349
Okay. This is not the way
it's supposed to go, okay?

275
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,935
Oh man, oh man, oh man.
Okay, this is so messed up.

276
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,313
This is so messed up!
This is so messed up!

277
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,273
Okay. Dude's probably got,
like, a family, kids, you know.

278
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,859
All that shit.
We gotta go to the cops with this.

279
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:27,405
Lay it all on 'em. Your superpowered
girlfriend, bad government dudes,

280
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,365
- Upside Down dimension planet thing...
- No.

281
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,951
But... But listen!

282
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,913
The bad government dudes are after
your super girlfriend, right? Right? Okay.

283
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,499
So maybe cops can help us
find out where she is.

284
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,708
They're gonna kill her.

285
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,644
- If they kill her, they're gonna kill us.
- Hey!

286
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,837
They might kill us before they kill her.

287
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
- I dunno, man.
- Argyle!

288
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:47,049
- Don't know what order they wanna go.
- Listen! Hey!

289
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,509
- Eeny meeny miny moe...
- Argyle!

290
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,970
- Listen!
- What?

291
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:53,306
Look, I think we can
figure this out, okay?

292
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,307
We just gotta open our minds.

293
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,727
Open our minds?
That's an open grave in front of me, man!

294
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,230
- Open my mind? What are you talking about?
- Listen. Hey, dude! Hey!

295
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,858
Just relax, okay?

296
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,111
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just go to the van...

297
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:09,114
...and do your thing, huh?

298
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:10,865
- Purple Palm Tree Delight.
- Right.

299
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,701
Right.

300
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,785
It's all worn off.

301
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,869
It's just worn off.

302
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:16,454
I'm all emotional.

303
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,124
- You're emotional.
- Okay.

304
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,711
- I'm sorry.
- You're fine.

305
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,128
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?

306
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:26,213
More weed? Is that really a good idea now?

307
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,174
Got a better idea to keep him calm?

308
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,594
Let's just get this done.

309
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,146
<i>You can't let him get to you.</i>

310
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:45,442
He's stoned out of his mind.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.

311
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,359
That doesn't mean he's wrong.

312
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,615
I mean, if that guy would've lived
one more second, one more second,

313
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,575
then w... we would know where she is.

314
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,494
Wh... Why didn't he just say the number?

315
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:00,289
I should've explained myself.

316
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,835
Maybe Eleven would've taken me with her
and things would be different, but...

317
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,587
- No.
- I didn't... I didn't know what to say.

318
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:12,594
Sometimes I think it's just scary
to open up like that.

319
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,137
To say how you really feel.

320
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,851
Especially to people
you care about the most.

321
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,645
Because, what if...

322
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,855
what if they don't like the truth?

323
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,278
Does anybody know
the dead dude's name?

324
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,197
- What?
- The dead dude.

325
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,324
I'm making him a headstone.

326
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:37,576
You do realize we spent all morning
<i>hiding</i> the body.

327
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,330
Well, I'll just write, uh,
"Here Lies Unknown Hero Agent Man."

328
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,751
Yeah. "Saved Argyle, Jonathan,
Will, and Mike from certain death."

329
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,713
You... You're gonna write our names
on the pizza box?

330
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,924
They're pretty common names.

331
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,301
Okay, dude. Uh, do your thing.

332
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,304
Jesus Christ.

333
00:25:58,097 --> 00:25:59,182
Come on, man.

334
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,183
That's his pen.

335
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,851
What?

336
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,604
Unknown Hero Agent Man,

337
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,273
that's the pen he gave me
right before he died.

338
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,607
Piece of shit.

339
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,734
Why would he give me a pen
that didn't work?

340
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,996
Come on.

341
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,705
Hey, man, I'm using that.

342
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,874
What are you doing?

343
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,169
Something fell outta that pen, man.

344
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,421
Wh... What is it?

345
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,217
It's the number.

346
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,760
We've had it this whole time.

347
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,221
We got his digits, man?

348
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,609
Did I tell you
it's okay to break?

349
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,362
Over there, there is a hand.

350
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,572
A HAND!

351
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,531
Are we animals?

352
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,327
Psst!

353
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,913
Hey, Ivan. Ivan!

354
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,174
Stop calling my name.

355
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,551
You trying to get me in trouble?

356
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,929
I don't know what they've told you,

357
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,472
but it is all lies.

358
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
I'm here by mistake!

359
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,059
I'm sorry. I cannot help you.

360
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,439
I can make you rich.

361
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,489
See this American?

362
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,615
He comes from money.

363
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,036
Old money.

364
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,957
Tell him, American.
Tell him how you will make him rich.

365
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,386
You're a real help, American,
you know that?

366
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,640
A real help.

367
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:07,559
Hey.

368
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,065
You want to die here?
You want to die? Is that it?

369
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:14,317
That's what we've been brought here to do.

370
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,528
So, that is it? You give up, then?

371
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,371
What about your woman, huh?

372
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,749
She's captured, yes, but still alive.

373
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,375
We can still save her.

374
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,586
"Save her."

375
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,007
That is amusing to you?

376
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,759
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

377
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,763
The closer I get with Joyce,
the more danger she's in.

378
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,308
You're not thinking straight, American.

379
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
No, I think I am.

380
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,398
For the first time in my life,
I think I'm thinking straight.

381
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,945
I used to think I was cursed.

382
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,865
Ever since I was 18.

383
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,048
Got some letter of induction in the mail.

384
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,913
Uncle Sam wants me
to go fight some war in the jungle.

385
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:14,085
Charlie's moving south like a plague
'cause of commie bastards like you, and...

386
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,628
You know, I'm happy enough to go.

387
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,340
Prove to my old man
I'm not the piece of shit he thinks I am.

388
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,846
I get over there, I must test well,
and they put me in the Chemical Corps.

389
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,516
There I am. I'm just... a kid, you know.

390
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,434
I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away,

391
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:35,481
and I'm mixing up
these... 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange.

392
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,234
With just these kitchen gloves, you know?

393
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,323
We used to clean out
these buffalo turbines after a run

394
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:45,157
and just be inhaling the stuff.

395
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,576
No masks, nothing.

396
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:53,958
"It's not chemical warfare.
It's just herbicide to kill plants."

397
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,171
"Harmless." That's what they told us.

398
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,092
Then I got back to real life,

399
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,428
and these guys I worked with,
the ones that made it back,

400
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:08,347
they started trying
to get back to normal, you know?

401
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,058
Having families.
And then things started going wrong.

402
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,439
Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.

403
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,777
Crooked spines, eyes popped out.

404
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:24,905
The horror...

405
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,326
followed us, clung to us.

406
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,163
My wife Diane, she wanted a baby.

407
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
<i>I did too.</i>

408
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,253
<i>We had a baby, and she was, um...</i>

409
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:41,673
<i>she was born healthy.</i>

410
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,423
<i>She was perfect, you know. Sara.</i>

411
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,176
And then she died.

412
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,886
Blood pressure's dropping.

413
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,931
<i>It wasn't an easy death. She...</i>

414
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:52,141
<i>suffered.</i>

415
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,310
<i>I knew the risks, but I, um...</i>

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,314
I hid them.

417
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:03,528
And then Diane left me.
She didn't blame me. Not with words.

418
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,613
After that, I was just...

419
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:11,076
I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.

420
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,582
And then people
started coming into my life.

421
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:22,337
<i>This girl El, and Joyce just happened,
and I told myself they needed me.</i>

422
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,673
But that wasn't true.

423
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,720
That's a lie. They didn't need me.

424
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:32,307
I needed them.

425
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,685
I needed them.

426
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:41,273
You were right, what you said last night.
I knew the risks,

427
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,483
breaking out of here, but I did it anyway.

428
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,155
<i>The minute I sent for Joyce,
the minute I sent for her,</i>

429
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,116
I sentenced her to death.

430
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,827
Just like I did with Sara.

431
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,795
Everyone I love, I hurt.

432
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,761
See, I was wrong this whole time.

433
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,640
I wasn't cursed.

434
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,853
I am the curse.

435
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,746
I've heard rumors of a monster.

436
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,914
From America.

437
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,002
I don't know
if what you say is true, American,

438
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,798
if you're truly a cursed man,
but you're right about one thing.

439
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,759
We are going to die in here.

440
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:18,953
Can I help you?

441
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,249
We need to look around.

442
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,807
Yep.

443
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,769
I think it's some kind of leak.

444
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
I haven't had a chance to fix it
with everything going on.

445
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,402
Pack your things. We're moving you.

446
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,249
The devil is here.

447
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,667
I can feel his presence...

448
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:11,340
growing stronger each day.

449
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:13,925
But I know Chrissy's in heaven now,

450
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,971
looking down at us, smiling.

451
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,724
Happy to see all the lives
she touched and brightened.

452
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,769
But I also know she's frustrated.

453
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:25,980
Angry.

454
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,650
That the monster
that did this to her is still out there.

455
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,318
Still.

456
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,653
Hurting others.

457
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,365
How can he live, while my angel is gone?

458
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
I know God has a plan...

459
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:50,545
Lord, I've prayed.

460
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,467
And I just do not understand it.

461
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,302
I see no reason.

462
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,472
I see no reason.

463
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,807
<i>So I finally
got ahold of Cappelletti.</i>

464
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,811
Photos for the '86 yearbook.

465
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,603
Hot damn.

466
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:09,648
Sinclair?

467
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:11,067
Goddamn traitor.

468
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,735
Only reason he'd lead us to a dead end.

469
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,028
The Hellfire Club.

470
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,365
- They're hiding Eddie.
- Maybe we should bring this to the cops.

471
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,576
The cops who think
Chrissy's a drug dealer?

472
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,054
Who are letting this... this psycho
go around killing people?

473
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,873
I'm just saying,
what if this cult is doing shit to us?

474
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:28,458
- Doing what?
- They already know we're after them.

475
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:33,047
- What if they cursed us or some shit?
- Patrick thinks he's cursed.

476
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,757
Hey!

477
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,175
None of this is funny.

478
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,137
Look, I don't believe
in that supernatural crap, all right?

479
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,222
But this cult is dangerous.

480
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,891
We have to be smart about this.

481
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:46,686
I made a list.

482
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,771
Everywhere these freaks have been seen.

483
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,023
We divide and conquer.
Check 'em out one by one. Smoke 'em out.

484
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,943
We should add Reefer Rick's house to this.

485
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,068
What?

486
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,195
Reefer Rick.

487
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,155
He's Eddie's supplier.

488
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,867
He's supposed to be in prison,
but someone spotted him back in his house.

489
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,536
Now my parents are freaking out and shit.

490
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,414
It's probably nothing.

491
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:07,623
I don't know.

492
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:09,625
No, that's good. That's good.

493
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,128
No stones unturned.

494
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,657
Yeah, that's not creepy.

495
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,748
What exactly are we supposed to be
looking for in this shithole?

496
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,998
We're not sure.

497
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:52,460
We just know this house
is important to Vecna.

498
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,378
Because Max saw it
in Vecna's red soup mind world?

499
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,922
- Basically.
- Great.

500
00:36:57,005 --> 00:37:00,300
Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is.
Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.

501
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,346
And how to stop him
before he comes back for Max.

502
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,514
We don't think he's in here,

503
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,641
do we?

504
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,184
Guess we'll find out.

505
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,143
Ready?

506
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,021
Mm-hmm.

507
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,152
<i>Max.</i>

508
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,905
What are you doing in here,

509
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,032
<i>Max?</i>

510
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,911
It's locked.

511
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:29,789
Should I knock, see if anybody's home?

512
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:30,873
No need.

513
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:35,835
I found a key.

514
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:10,018
Looks like someone
forgot to pay their electric bill.

515
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,958
Where'd everyone get those?

516
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:18,878
Do you need to be told everything?

517
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,257
You're not a child.

518
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,882
- Thank you.
- Huh.

519
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,927
Back pocket.

520
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:39,358
They just left everything.

521
00:38:40,108 --> 00:38:42,777
I guess a triple homicide
isn't good for resale value.

522
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,947
Hey, guys?

523
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:48,826
You all see that, right?

524
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:51,244
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,041
Is this what you saw?

526
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,210
In your visions?

527
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:04,925
I mean, it's... just a clock.

528
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,592
Right?

529
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,271
Like a normal old clock.

530
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,981
Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?

531
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,570
Maybe he's, like,
a clockmaker or something?

532
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,655
I think you cracked the case, Steve.

533
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,949
All I know is

534
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,119
the answers are here.

535
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,329
Somewhere.

536
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,001
Okay, everyone stay in groups of two.
Robin, upstairs.

537
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:42,755
Come on. Let's go.

538
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,221
- Was that a sigh?
- No, I did not sigh.

539
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,724
- Why'd you sigh?
- I didn't sigh. Just come on, dude.

540
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:56,976
- I heard you.
- W... We're just always partners, okay?

541
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,603
You have a problem with that?

542
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:01,190
It'd just be nice
to, I don't know, mix it up a bit.

543
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,460
- I'm boring you? Is that it?
- No, the opposite...

544
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,782
Ah.

545
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,242
Hey, Yuri.

546
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,246
Yuri, I need to take a piss here.

547
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,331
Just give it up. He can't hear you.

548
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,666
I really do have to go, Joyce.

549
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,335
This isn't some ploy to escape.

550
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,632
- He can't hear.
- What?

551
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,931
Joyce, what are you doing?

552
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,684
Joyce! Joyce!

553
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:41,146
- Joyce!
- My leg is too short.

554
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,981
Can you grab that shard with your foot?

555
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,068
Perhaps, you know,
we should talk this through first.

556
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,695
What is there to talk through?

557
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,965
We cut our binds, break free.

558
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,114
Yes, okay. Then what?

559
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:53,159
- Then you take him out.
- Take him out?

560
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,121
You know karate.
You said you were a black belt.

561
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,036
We're 10,000 feet in the air, Joyce.

562
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,414
I take him, who flies this plane?

563
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,416
All right, so don't knock him out.

564
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,751
Just get his gun
and make him turn us around.

565
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:05,545
Get his gun. Just like that, huh?

566
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:08,507
- Is black not the highest color?
- Yes.

567
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,385
- It's just...
- Just what?

568
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,387
I've never fought
in a real-world scenario, okay?

569
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,849
I've only sparred with the other students.

570
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:18,432
How old?

571
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,561
It doesn't go younger than 13.

572
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:21,936
Thirteen?

573
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,648
But Jeremiah is 16.

574
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,483
Almost. His birthday is next month.

575
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,943
And... And Jeremiah is a ferocious fighter.

576
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,362
Lightning fast. Very skilled.

577
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,240
And I beat him.

578
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:36,076
That one time.

579
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,414
And certainly Yuri is not
trained or skilled like Jeremiah.

580
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,289
So, yes.

581
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,918
Yes, you're right.

582
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,003
I can defeat Yuri.

583
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:47,378
Absolutely.

584
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:51,382
Thank you for talking it through.
I feel much better now.

585
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,927
Yeah.

586
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,583
No.

587
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,891
Well, well.

588
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,061
Look who finally decided to join us.

589
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,983
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

590
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,074
<i>Stop this!</i>

591
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,659
Let me out!

592
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,697
<i>In 1786,</i>

593
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,034
Nicolas Dalayrac
wrote an opera called <i>Nina.</i>

594
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,121
Papa.

595
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,875
<i>It's the story about a young woman
whose lover was killed in a duel.</i>

596
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,461
Nina was so traumatized
that she buried the memory.

597
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,090
It was as if it never happened.

598
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:58,010
<i>Every day, she would return
to the train station</i>

599
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,887
<i>to await her lover's return.</i>

600
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,347
<i>A return that would never be.</i>

601
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:05,434
If only Nina could know the truth.

602
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:07,936
This... This isn't real.

603
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:09,021
<i>No.</i>

604
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:10,396
<i>But it once was.</i>

605
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,775
A memory.

606
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,983
<i>Very good.</i>

607
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,028
How?

608
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,572
Never mind how.

609
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:19,947
<i>Let me out.</i>

610
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,324
I want out!

611
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,327
<i>I'm sorry, Eleven.</i>

612
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,663
You'll have to find your own way out.

613
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,164
<i>Leave your train station.</i>

614
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,958
<i>Stop waiting.</i>

615
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,043
<i>Focus.</i>

616
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:33,003
Listen.

617
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:34,545
Remember.

618
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,130
I don't understand.

619
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,967
I don't understand!

620
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,637
Well, well.

621
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,766
Look who finally decided to join us.

622
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,436
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

623
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:53,065
<i>Focus.</i>

624
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,148
<i>Listen.</i>

625
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,608
<i>Remember.</i>

626
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,405
Well, well.

627
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,742
Look who finally decided to join us.

628
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,994
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.

629
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,500
I'm sorry. Am I... in trouble?

630
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,043
Trouble?

631
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:15,961
No.

632
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,340
No, why do you think that?

633
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:20,425
You're just missing out on all the fun.

634
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,719
Training starts any minute.

635
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:24,054
Okay.

636
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:26,931
Hey.

637
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:29,601
There's nothing to be nervous about.

638
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:31,603
You're going to do great today.

639
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,521
I just know it.

640
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:43,824
- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, Papa.

641
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:46,159
How are we feeling today?

642
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:47,827
Good, Papa.

643
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,663
Good.

644
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,873
Number Twelve.

645
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,125
Would you be so kind and open the door?

646
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:54,835
Yes, Papa.

647
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,295
Please, follow me.

648
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,313
- How's she doing?
- Very well.

649
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,606
She's swimming now.

650
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:18,567
Good. 'Cause I just
got off the phone with Stinson.

651
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:21,320
We don't have much time.

652
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:24,322
Well then,
she'll just have to swim faster.

653
00:46:57,563 --> 00:47:00,858
- There's one. Argyle, slow down.
- There's one what?

654
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,586
- Slow down.
- Stop barking orders.

655
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,737
Argyle! Slow down!

656
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,740
- Whoa!
- Christ!

657
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:14,498
202-968-6161.

658
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,335
Is it ringing?

659
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:21,672
No, it's just making
a bunch of weird noises.

660
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,422
Busy?

661
00:47:24,465 --> 00:47:26,802
Listen to this.

662
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,344
That remind you of anything?

663
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,972
<i>WarGames.</i>

664
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,847
What?

665
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,311
Oh my God, we're not calling a phone.

666
00:47:37,228 --> 00:47:38,730
We're calling a computer.

667
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:43,735
I don't know if Nina's a computer
like Joshua or Owens' lab,

668
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:46,822
but Unknown Hero Agent Man
gave us access to it for a reason.

669
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:51,034
We just need to find the computer.
We find Owens, then warn him.

670
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:52,327
Then we warn Eleven.

671
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,494
I just need a hacker.

672
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,329
The only hacker that I know lives...

673
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,623
in Utah.

674
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,001
- Wait, Utah?
- Salt Lake City, to be specific.

675
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,168
Oh my God.

676
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,547
Oh my God.

677
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,047
What? Why "Oh my God"?

678
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:07,467
<i>♪ Turn around ♪</i>

679
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,387
<i>- ♪ Look at what you see ♪</i>
- Oh no.

680
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:13,139
<i>NeverEnding Story.</i>
That scared the shit out of me.

681
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:16,434
The Nothing, man?
That's some proper existential shit, dude.

682
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,157
You can't be serious.

683
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,396
If we take the I-15 north,
we'll get there by morning.

684
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,481
Oh, you're serious.

685
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,818
I know it sounds insane,
but Suzie saved the world last year.

686
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,945
Maybe she can save it again.

687
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,061
Shit. Shit.

688
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,693
Looks like Rick's had company.

689
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:37,472
It's him.

690
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:39,351
Hey, Dustin.

691
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,434
You there?

692
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,269
It's Eddie. You remember me, right?

693
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:46,148
<i>Hey, if anyone's there, I really think
I might be in a bit of trouble here.</i>

694
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,818
Okay? Wheeler?

695
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,152
Anybody?!

696
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,371
Hey, uh, Henderson?

697
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:01,873
Yeah?

698
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:03,166
Could you maybe, uh,

699
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,713
clarify what sort of clues
we're supposed to be looking for here?

700
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,592
"The world is full of obvious things

701
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,762
which nobody by any chance ever observes."

702
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:20,349
Sherlock Holmes.

703
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,061
That's great.

704
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,273
Thanks. That's great.

705
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,356
Really helpful.

706
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:28,773
Sherlock...

707
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,389
Whoa, whoa.

708
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,641
- What's wrong?
- There was a spider.

709
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,686
- What?
- It's a black widow.

710
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:09,231
- Okay.
- Don't go in there.

711
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,400
Oh, oh.

712
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,527
- Wait, just...
- What?

713
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,945
- Something? Shit. Okay.
- Wait. Stop moving.

714
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,574
- Stop. I just... I got it. I got it.
- Thank you.

715
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,992
If there's a spider,
you're never gonna find it

716
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,911
till it lays eggs
and the babies spill out.

717
00:51:21,994 --> 00:51:24,039
What's wrong with you?

718
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,331
Robin, seriously.

719
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,541
She's got problems.

720
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,420
- Tell me about it.
- It's cool you two are friends now.

721
00:51:31,003 --> 00:51:34,257
Maybe after we find Vecna, kill him,
save the world and stuff,

722
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,800
maybe we can all go out.

723
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,554
You know? Me, you, Robin,
Jonathan, when he's back.

724
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,891
It's not like we're dating.
Me and Robin. Not like we're dating.

725
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:47,311
- She told you? That we're not?
- Yes. She made that very clear.

726
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:49,271
Platonic with a capital P.

727
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,690
Yep. Thank you.

728
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,440
I mean...

729
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,610
I would date her. It's just...

730
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:57,280
She's... We're just...
Never mind. We're friends.

731
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,697
- Just friends.
- Right. Right.

732
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,617
Okay. All better.

733
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,786
Great. Thanks.

734
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:05,329
Well...

735
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,123
Great. Um...

736
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:14,797
Guess we should, uh,
get back to the investigation.

737
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:20,804
"The obvious things
are not what people observe."

738
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,429
Or... "Do... Don't observe."

739
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,514
Or...

740
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:27,936
Sherlock Holmes.

741
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,317
What?

742
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:54,378
I wish we had a longer loop.

743
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,130
Forty-six minutes isn't bad.

744
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,634
I think there are bigger concerns.

745
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:00,885
Like...

746
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,681
What if, by listening to this
over and over, I get sick of it,

747
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,016
and suddenly it's not my favorite anymore?

748
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:11,730
Will it still work? Or will Kate Bush,
like, lose her magic power or something?

749
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,315
Kate Bush? Never.

750
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,858
You're a Kate Bush fan?

751
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,193
Uh, yeah. Now I am.

752
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,237
- Really?
- Yeah, mega-fan.

753
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,572
She... She saved your life.

754
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:24,617
Besides, we're hot on this creep's trail.
We're gonna find Vecna

755
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,413
and kill him before he even thinks about
messing with you again. All right?

756
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,208
In fact, I bet if we hit these suckers
in the right combo,

757
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:35,170
we might just open a door
to his secret lair.

758
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,882
Voilà.

759
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,217
You're such a dork.

760
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,344
I thought you were, like,
one of the cool kids now.

761
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,137
I'm not cool?

762
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,184
I've really missed that.

763
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:50,934
Missed what?

764
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,896
Your laugh.

765
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,860
All done.

766
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:02,112
Work your magic, Kate.

767
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:11,164
I promise I'm gonna stop asking this, but...

768
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:13,916
...you're seeing that, right?

769
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,085
Yeah.

770
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:22,759
<i>♪ Feel how it feels ♪</i>

771
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,135

00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,719
Stop.

775
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,472
Very good, Two.

776
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:12,099
Very good.

777
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:16,771
Now,

778
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,606
which brave soul

779
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,233
would like to follow that?

780
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:22,693
Hmm?

781
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,989
- Hmm?
- Me. Me. Me.

782
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:30,534
Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.

783
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:33,246
Eleven?

784
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,641
Remember to stay focused.

785
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:56,728
Find the energy.

786
00:55:57,978 --> 00:55:58,980
Feel it.

787
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,931
Why does he waste so much time with her?

788
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,556
Hey.

789
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:36,893
Quiet.

790
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:42,565
They're laughing.

791
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:44,065
At you.

792
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,985
They think you're weak.

793
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,739
Show them, Eleven.

794
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:52,199
Show them.

795
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,666
Good.

796
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,001
Now make it move.

797
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,606
Waste of time.

798
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:14,032
- What is happening?
- She's going into arrest.

799
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:16,409
Okay, that's enough. Pull her out.

800
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,161
Pull her out!

801
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:48,775
Naughty, naughty bird.

802
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,443
Did you fall out of your nest?

803
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,862
Where do you think you are going?

804
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,447
Come on.

805
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,867
Be a good girl now
and get back to your place.

806
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,452
Or what? Are you gonna shoot me?

807
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,248
I... I don't think the KGB would like that.

808
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,958
You're right, I cannot kill you.

809
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,710
But KGB didn't specify
condition you must arrive in.

810
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,005
You are fragile cargo.

811
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:12,965
You can still break.

812
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,969
Not if I break you first.

813
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:22,849
My fingers are like arrows.

814
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,603
My arms, like iron.

815
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:28,106
My feet, like spears.

816
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:30,400
Resist,

817
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,277
and I will end you.

818
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,112
But turn this plane around,

819
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:37,990
and I will spare your life.

820
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,168
Kiai!

821
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:15,737
Ah! Kiai!

822
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:47,434
Let him go!

823
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,269
Let him go!

824
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,958
My fingers are like arrows.

825
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:14,920
My arms, like iron!

826
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:20,050
My feet, like spears!

827
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:21,719
Kiai!

828
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:24,764
Kiai!

829
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:29,601
What did you do?

830
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,561
What?

831
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,731
I said, <i>"Don't</i> knock him out."

832
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:46,494
- I thought you didn't know how to fly!
- I don't!

833
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,512
Pull up! Pull up!

834
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,224
I am pulling up!

835
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,693
It's like the Christmas lights.

836
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,027
The Christmas lights?

837
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,030
Yeah, when Will was in the Upside Down,

838
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:08,201
the lights... came to life.

839
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:09,994
Vecna's here.

840
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,329
In this house.

841
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,583
Just on the other side.

842
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,297
I think he just left the room.

843
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:24,592
Did he hear us?

844
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,552
Can he see us?

845
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:27,677
Headphones.

846
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,722
Wait, wait.

847
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,391
Everyone, turn off your flashlights
and spread out.

848
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:35,686
We're not gonna be able to see
if we turn off our flash... lights.

849
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:39,023
Jesus Christ.

850
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,291
I got him!

851
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,376
Got him!

852
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,753
I got him.

853
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:04,673
I... I had him.

854
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,175
Oh, whoa.

855
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,137
Oh, I think he's moving.
He's moving. He's moving.

856
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:23,192
Shit.

857
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:24,360
I lost him.

858
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,527
No, you didn't.

859
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,753
It's an attic. Of course it's an attic.

860
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:48,009
Hold up, guys.
What if he's leading us into a trap?

861
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:50,260
Guys, guys.

862
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,471
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

863
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,606
Dude, he's not here, seriously.

864
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,065
Shut up and keep looking.

865
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:20,625
Dustin?

866
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,585
Please. Are... Are you there?

867
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:26,295
Never mind.

868
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,648
Come with me.

869
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,414
Holy shit.

870
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:02,831
Hey, freak!

871
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,711
- Where do you think you're going?
- Shit.

872
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,342
Come on!

873
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:14,929
- Just come on...
- You scared of some water? Let's go!

874
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,681
...you piece of shit!

875
01:06:17,764 --> 01:06:20,518
Come on. Gotta help me out here, man.

876
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:22,186
Come on.

877
01:06:22,268 --> 01:06:23,646
Come on, you piece of shit!

878
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:25,606
Come on!

879
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,400
Goddamn it!

880
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,070
Nope? Okay. All right. Okay.

881
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,077
Shit. Shit.

882
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,721
Flashlights.

883
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,442
Okay, what's happening?

884
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,121
Hey, stay back, man! Stay back!

885
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:05,829
Stay back!

886
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,833
Come on. We almost have him.

887
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:11,586
Hey, Patrick.

888
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,588
Patrick!

889
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,382
Patrick!

890
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,221
Patrick.

891
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,431
Hey, Patrick.

892
01:08:24,015 --> 01:08:25,016
Hey, Patrick.

893
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:26,851
Patrick!

894
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,760
Air.

895
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,679
Get her some air, for Christ's sake.

896
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:04,305
It's okay. It will take time to adjust.

897
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:06,350
But you're safe now, hmm?

898
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,456
Giving us quite the workout.
You really wanna do this again?

899
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,670
No! No! No!

900
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,485
Remarkable.

901
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:13,417
Stay away.

902
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,051
I said, stay away!

903
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:32,310
You didn't think it would be that easy,

904
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:33,811
did you?

905
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,609
I don't understand.

906
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,237
I do.

907
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:16,561
Papa?

908
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:19,399
Daughter.
