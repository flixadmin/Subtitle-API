1
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:45,111
"In the decade of the 1930s,
even the great city of Metropolis...

2
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,032
...was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.

3
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,703
In the times of fear and confusion,
the job of informing the public...

4
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,789
...was the responsibility
of the Daily Planet...

5
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:02,337
...a great metropolitan newspaper,
whose reputation for clarity and truth...

6
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:07,467
...had become a symbol of hope
for the city of Metropolis."

7
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:44,053
This is no fantasy...

8
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:47,890
...no careless product
of wild imagination.

9
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,726
No, my good friends.

10
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:58,025
These indictments
I have brought you today...

11
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:03,406
...the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

12
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:08,202
...their acts of treason,
their ultimate aim of sedition...

13
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,877
...these are matters of undeniable fact.

14
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,093
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

15
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,096
...on those accused.

16
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,271
On this...

17
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,775
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

18
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:42,194
...are wanton violence and destruction.

19
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:46,782
On the woman, Ursa...

20
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,536
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

21
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,582
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

22
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,593
Finally, General Zod.

23
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,971
Once trusted by this council...

24
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,767
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

25
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,144
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

26
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:21,150
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

27
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,904
...with himself as absolute ruler.

28
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,658
You have heard the evidence.

29
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,995
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

30
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,497
Guilty.

31
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,625
Guilty.

32
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,835
Guilty.

33
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,132
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

34
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,594
It has therefore
now become your decision.

35
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,097
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

36
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,183
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

37
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:04,360
Join us.

38
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,532
You have been known to disagree
with the council before.

39
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,368
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order...

40
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,453
...second only to my own.

41
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,165
I offer you a chance
for greatness, Jor-El!

42
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,460
Take it! Join us!

43
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,713
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

44
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,173
I swear it.

45
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:31,220
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

46
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,721
Both you...

47
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,889
...and then one day...

48
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,392
...your heirs!

49
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,763
No!

50
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,391
- Let us out of here!
- Help me!

51
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,483
- Forgive me!
- I shall return!

52
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,984
Forgive me!

53
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,695
I shall return!

54
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:31,465
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

55
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:34,677
They have received the fate
they deserved.

56
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,346
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

57
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,808
...an eternal living death.

58
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:44,186
A chance for life, nonetheless.

59
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,981
As opposed to us.

60
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:51,026
It's suicide. No, it's worse.

61
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,528
It's genocide.

62
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,655
Be warned, Jor-El.

63
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:59,201
The council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

64
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,665
My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

65
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:09,837
I am not given to wild,
unsupported statements.

66
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:13,507
And I tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately.

67
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,553
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

68
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,888
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

69
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,897
It isn't that they question your data.
The facts are undeniable.

70
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,030
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

71
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:43,245
This planet will explode
within 30 days, if not sooner.

72
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,998
I tell you,
Krypton is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:50,085
Jor-El, be reasonable.

74
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,422
My friend...

75
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,592
...I have never been otherwise.

76
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,844
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,764
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,851
The decision of the council is final.

79
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:30,626
Any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace...

80
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:34,880
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

81
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,133
You would accuse me of insurrection?

82
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,387
Has it now become a crime
to cherish life?

83
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,724
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

84
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,309
...in the Phantom Zone...

85
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,728
...the eternal void...

86
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,065
...which you yourself discovered.

87
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:58,737
Will you abide by the council's decision?

88
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,869
I will remain silent.

89
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:11,917
Neither I, nor my wife
will leave Krypton.

90
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,640
Have you finished?

91
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,770
Nearly.

92
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,402
It's the only answer, Lara.

93
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,782
If he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will.

94
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,284
But why Earth, Jor-El?

95
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,120
They're primitives
thousands of years behind us.

96
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,998
He will need that advantage to survive.

97
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,796
Their atmosphere will sustain him.

98
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,848
He will defy their gravity.

99
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,476
He will look like one of them.

100
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,020
He won't be one of them.

101
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,855
No.

102
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,692
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

103
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,031
He'll be odd. Different.

104
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:11,286
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

105
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:15,207
Isolated, alone.

106
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,712
He will not be alone.

107
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:28,679
He will never be alone.

108
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,231
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters...

109
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,440
...is now in excess.

110
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:44,570
Our data indicates the loss is due
to a misuse of energy.

111
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,071
Investigate.

112
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,908
And if the investigation
proves correct?

113
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,913
He knew the penalty he faced.

114
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,749
Even as a member of this council.

115
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,087
The law will be upheld.

116
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:55,057
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

117
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,727
But we will never leave you...

118
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:02,522
...even in the face of our deaths.

119
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,695
The richness of our lives,
it will be yours.

120
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:13,575
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

121
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,578
...all this and more...

122
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,916
...I bequeath you, my son.

123
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:29,424
You will carry me inside you
all the days of your life.

124
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,556
You will make my strength your own,
see my life through your eyes...

125
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:39,768
...as your life will be seen through mine.

126
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,483
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

127
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,115
This is all I...

128
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,536
All I can send you...

129
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,955
...Kal-El.

130
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,970
Stop. Stop, stop!

131
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,559
...which einstein called...

132
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,894
...his theory of relativity.

133
00:24:56,062 --> 00:25:01,066
Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...

134
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,069
...and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...

135
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,489
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

136
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,138
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationships...

137
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,894
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...

138
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,526
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

139
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,611
...your strength, your hearing...

140
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:51,616
...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

141
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:56,788
The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

142
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,874
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

143
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,877
...contain their own individual law,
space and time.

144
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:07,257
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

145
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,000
What was that?

146
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,358
Now, wouldn't that beat all get-out?

147
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,235
Will you... You...

148
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:10,528
Huh?

149
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,204
Pa...

150
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,040
Oh, my.

151
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:56,741
All these years, as happy as we've been...

152
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,743
...how I've prayed the good Lord...

153
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,496
...see fit to give us a child.

154
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,500
Honey, will you hand me
that rag up there.

155
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,168
You take things easy, Jonathan.

156
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:09,879
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

157
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:19,764
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

158
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,975
...who that boy's proper family is.

159
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:26,104
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

160
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,527
Martha, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

161
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:37,865
We could say he's the child
of my cousin in North Dakota.

162
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,367
And just now orphaned.

163
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:44,330
- Oh, Martha.
- Jonathan, he's only a baby.

164
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:48,209
Martha, now, you saw how we found him.

165
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,213
There's something very strange about that boy.

166
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,299
Yeah, you saw him.
Martha, you saw him...

167
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,926
...just as plain as I did, Martha.

168
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:04,017
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening
to what I'm saying?

169
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:06,686
Jonathan!

170
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,907
All right, bring that ball back.
Come on, now.

171
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,784
Again, and through the uprights!

172
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:09,540
Pick up that ball, it's a fumble!
Come on back, let's sharpen and try again.

173
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,419
Hey, yo! Let's go!

174
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:18,091
Come on, let's get that ball over the uprights,
not underneath it!

175
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:20,927
What, do you think that ball's gonna do,
just fly there by itself?

176
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:23,304
- Come on!
- Ra, ra, ra!

177
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:27,433
What's wrong?
We've got to get it together, guys.

178
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:36,025
Come on, gang.

179
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,778
Come on.

180
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:41,656
- That was a great game.
- Yeah, but next week we're...

181
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:43,991
All right.

182
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,619
Come on, gang, hustle. Let's go.

183
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,329
Stack your helmets neatly.

184
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:51,499
Remember about those uniforms.
Cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

185
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,668
...and looking like a football team.

186
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,837
Clark, have the clothes
washed and ready...

187
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:57,630
- ...for tomorrow's game.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,173
Got to beat Mount Vernon High!

189
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:02,260
- Can you give me a lift?
- Home early!

190
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:10,601
Lana? Don't bother with these, huh?

191
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,521
I'll take them in
with the other equipment.

192
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,482
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

193
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:20,027
I think you're the nicest guy
in the whole school.

194
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,781
Well, thanks.

195
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:28,035
Of course, it's part of the job,
being team manager and all.

196
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,956
And I'd do it for you anyway.

197
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,710
Listen, a whole bunch of us
are going up to Mary Ellen's...

198
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,503
...play some records.

199
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:39,630
Would you like to come?

200
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,592
Oh, well...

201
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,344
Heh. I don't know...

202
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:52,185
Sure. Sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.

203
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:55,021
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

204
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:58,274
What are you talking about?
I just finished stacking all the...

205
00:31:58,442 --> 00:31:59,775
- All that?
- Oh.

206
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:02,278
Oh, Brad.

207
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,405
Hey, come on, Lana.

208
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:07,867
Bad taste, bad Brad.

209
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:14,749
Sorry, Lana.
Guess I'd better clean it up.

210
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:17,418
Come on, Lana.

211
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,295
Come on, let's go.

212
00:32:20,297 --> 00:32:21,964
- He's got to clean up.
- Bye, Clark.

213
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:24,800
- Yeah. Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

214
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,512
- Let's go.
- Bye, Clark.

215
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,306
- We're off to Mary Ellen's.
- See you, Clark.

216
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:32,475
All right.

217
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,228
- Bye, Clark.
- Bye, Clark.

218
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:38,648
Bye, Clark. See you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

219
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,966
Woo-hoo!

220
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,978
Golly, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

221
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,230
Faster even!

222
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:04,817
Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift
for invention.

223
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,986
- I'll say that for you.
- But... But...

224
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,448
Lois, please read your book.

225
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,325
No one ever believes me.

226
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,995
Hey, look. There's Clark.

227
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:42,498
How come he's here?

228
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,667
Clark.

229
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:46,544
How'd you get here so fast?

230
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:50,214
- I ran.
- Ran, huh?

231
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,551
Told you he's an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

232
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,977
Been showing off a bit,
haven't you, son?

233
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,361
Uh...

234
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,533
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

235
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:24,457
It's just that, guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

236
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:26,500
Yeah. I know.

237
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,794
- Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
- Yeah, I know...

238
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,963
...you can do all these amazing things...

239
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:33,841
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

240
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,801
...unless you can tell people about it.

241
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,804
Yeah. I mean, every time
I get the football...

242
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:41,849
- ...I can make a touchdown. Every time.
- That's for sure.

243
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:44,518
I mean, is it showing off
if somebody's doing...

244
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:48,314
...the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

245
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:51,650
No. No, now you listen to me.

246
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,986
When you first came to us,
we thought people...

247
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:56,822
...would come take you away
because when they found out...

248
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,659
...you know, the things you could do,
and that worried us a lot.

249
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:03,704
Then a man gets older,
and he thinks very differently...

250
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,582
...and things get very clear.

251
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,626
And there's one thing I do know, son...

252
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:12,213
...and that is you are here for a reason.

253
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,799
I don't know whose reason,
but whatever the reason...

254
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,926
...maybe it's because...

255
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,431
I don't know, it's...

256
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,018
But I do know one thing:

257
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:28,854
It's not to score touchdowns.

258
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,564
Huh?

259
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,691
Thanks, Dad.

260
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,945
I'll race you to it. Dad.

261
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:38,113
- You will, huh?
- Come on. Come on, Pop, run.

262
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,449
Come on. Move. Move.
Yeah, go, go, go. Come on, run.

263
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:44,995
Hey, Baron! Hey, Baron. Hey, boy.

264
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,796
Oh, no.

265
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:11,730
Jonathan.

266
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,901
Jonathan!

267
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,992
Dad.

268
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,834
Jonathan!

269
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,172
No! Jonathan!

270
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,836
All those things I can do...

271
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,381
...all those powers...

272
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:24,386
...and I couldn't even save him.

273
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:19,580
Clark, get up.

274
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,294
Good morning, Smiley.

275
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:29,006
Clark, breakfast.

276
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,262
Are you gonna sleep all day?

277
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:39,600
Clark, come on. Get up.

278
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,411
I have to leave.

279
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:49,670
I knew this time would come.

280
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:52,214
We both knew it...

281
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:54,508
...from the day we found you.

282
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:07,938
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday...

283
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:14,444
...and he said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

284
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,204
Mother...

285
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:27,207
I know, son.

286
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,627
I know.

287
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:37,843
Do you know where you're headed?

288
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:43,140
North.

289
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,480
Remember us, son.

290
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,151
Always remember us.

291
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:21,968
My son...

292
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,810
...you do not remember me.

293
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,479
I am Jor-El.

294
00:55:34,523 --> 00:55:35,982
I'm your father.

295
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:41,529
By now, you will have reached
your 18th year...

296
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:44,365
...as it is measured on earth.

297
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:47,994
By that reckoning,
I will have been dead...

298
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:51,414
...for many thousands of your years.

299
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,877
The knowledge that I have...

300
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:58,796
...matters physical and historic...

301
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:03,176
...I've given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

302
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:08,765
These are important matters, to be sure,
but still matters of mere fact.

303
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,102
There are questions to be asked.

304
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,023
And it is time for you to do so.

305
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:20,652
Here in this...

306
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:24,948
This Fortress of Solitude...

307
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:28,409
...we shall try to find
the answers together.

308
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,707
How does a good man live?
What is virtue?

309
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:39,462
When does a man's obligation to those
around him exceed his obligation to himself?

310
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,548
And these are not simple questions.

311
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,802
Even on Krypton...

312
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:51,724
...there is no precise science
which provides us with the answers.

313
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:57,939
I can only tell you
what I myself believe.

314
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:01,484
And to this end I've tried to anticipate
your questions...

315
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,237
...in the order of their importance to you.

316
00:57:05,906 --> 00:57:07,824
So, my son...

317
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,284
...speak.

318
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,037
Who am I?

319
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:15,665
Your name is Kal-El.

320
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:20,169
You are the only survivor
of the planet Krypton.

321
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:23,047
Even though you've been raised
as a human being...

322
00:57:23,215 --> 00:57:25,091
...you are not one of them.

323
00:57:25,718 --> 00:57:27,927
You have great powers...

324
00:57:28,095 --> 00:57:32,181
...only some of which
you have as yet discovered.

325
00:57:34,643 --> 00:57:36,185
Come with me now, my son...

326
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:39,188
...as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement.

327
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,859
Traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions.

328
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:46,404
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

329
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:49,699
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

330
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:53,578
Rather, let your leadership
stir others to.

331
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:59,792
In this next year, we shall examine
the human heart.

332
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,670
It is more fragile than your own.

333
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:04,047
For the past two years...

334
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:08,718
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

335
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:11,262
...we'll enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

336
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,057
...source of your strength
and nourishment...

337
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,934
...cause of our eventual destruction.

338
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:20,938
The planet Krypton, my son.

339
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:24,484
Your home, as it was.

340
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:29,697
This year, we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

341
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:32,617
...and their basis in actual fact.

342
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:37,497
The total accumulation of all knowledge,
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

343
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:41,042
...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

344
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,252
Study them well, my son...

345
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,255
...and learn from them.
We've reasoned out logical judgments.

346
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,801
By the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy...

347
00:58:49,968 --> 00:58:52,720
...12 of your years will have passed.

348
00:58:52,888 --> 00:58:57,850
For this reason, among others,
I have chosen Earth for you.

349
00:58:58,018 --> 00:59:01,312
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...

350
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,899
...and to serve its collective humanity.

351
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,860
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

352
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:11,572
...to discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

353
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:17,453
Always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage.

354
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,957
They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.

355
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,627
They only lack the light to show the way.

356
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:29,924
For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...

357
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,635
...I have sent them you...

358
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,097
...my only son.

359
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:26,480
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

360
01:00:26,648 --> 01:00:28,691
Fresh fruit. Hey, lady,
how about a tomato?

361
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,776
Fresh fruit.
Hey, baby, how's it going?

362
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:35,239
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
They're so fresh...

363
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:38,534
Fresh fruit and vegetables.
Get them while they're hot.

364
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:41,245
Look at these tomatoes.
Aren't they beautiful?

365
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:56,677
He did a great job.
You see his article this morning?

366
01:01:05,437 --> 01:01:07,146
Smile.

367
01:01:08,774 --> 01:01:12,193
- How many T's in "bloodletting"?
- Two.

368
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,576
- What are you writing, Miss Lane?
- An ode to spring.

369
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,787
- How do you spell "massacre"?
- Uh...

370
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:27,250
- M-A-S-S-A-C-R-E.
- A... C...

371
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,168
...R-E. Thank you.

372
01:01:29,336 --> 01:01:31,545
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

373
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:34,006
A good reporter doesn't
get great stories, Jimmy.

374
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:34,708
A good reporter...

375
01:01:34,932 --> 01:01:36,008
- ...makes them great.
- ...makes them great.

376
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:37,843
Here's that story
on the East Side murder.

377
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:41,097
Way I see, it's a banner headline,
front page with maybe my picture...

378
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,392
There's only one P in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

379
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,852
- Told you one P.
- Hello, Miss Lane. How are...?

380
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,355
Remember my exposé
on the sex and drug orgies...

381
01:01:49,523 --> 01:01:51,107
...in the senior citizens home?

382
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,276
How you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

383
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:56,279
- Oh, hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

384
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,573
It's got everything. It's got sex,
violence, the ethnic angle...

385
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:02,118
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

386
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,620
- Kent, can you open this?
- Oh, sure, Mr. White.

387
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:06,455
This could be a series of articles:

388
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,625
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings,"
by Lois Lane.

389
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,378
We get psychologists, sociologists...

390
01:02:12,546 --> 01:02:16,132
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

391
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,968
- The Daily Planet has a tradition...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

392
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:22,638
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to shake it up like that.

393
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,807
Oh, of course not, Lois.

394
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:28,477
Why would anyone want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

395
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:33,149
- I'll take that.
- Oh, thank... I'm sorry, Mr. White.

396
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:37,069
Olsen, why am I paying you when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

397
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:38,821
- Go get Mr... A towel.
- Kent.

398
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,448
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, chief.

399
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:42,491
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, chief.

400
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:45,077
- And don't call me sugar.
- "Blood is in Metropolis...

401
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:47,330
- Right, sugar.
- ...while the crocuses bloom."

402
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,666
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

403
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:54,462
Lois, why don't you take Kent
out to meet everybody, huh?

404
01:02:54,629 --> 01:02:57,840
Just introduce him around.
He's starting with the paper today.

405
01:02:58,008 --> 01:02:59,425
I'm giving him the city beat.

406
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:03,346
Chief, that's my beat.

407
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,850
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just
a mild-mannered reporter, but listen...

408
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:11,479
...not only does he know how to treat
his editor in chief with respect...

409
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:14,190
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

410
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:18,194
...but he is, in my 40 years in this
business, the fastest typist I've seen.

411
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:20,029
- That's great.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

412
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,490
Here, you forgot my article.

413
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,702
Oh, excuse me, Mr. White?

414
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,122
I was wondering if perhaps
you could arrange for half my salary...

415
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,209
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

416
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:34,960
- Your bookie, right?
- My what?

417
01:03:35,128 --> 01:03:39,215
Don't tell me, he sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

418
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,384
Actually, she's silver-haired.

419
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:44,845
Uh, I'll see what I can do.

420
01:03:45,013 --> 01:03:48,015
Uh, thank you very much, Mr. White.

421
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:49,850
Excuse me.

422
01:03:51,812 --> 01:03:53,396
Well...

423
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:55,981
Any more at home like you?

424
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:58,275
Not really, no.

425
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:02,822
I didn't think so.

426
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:07,410
- Well, get yourself a desk over here.
- Over here?

427
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,913
Yeah, right here.
There are some papers in a pile right there.

428
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:13,916
Sorry. Excuse me.

429
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:31,559
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

430
01:04:31,726 --> 01:04:33,269
- Very nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

431
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,562
Thank you.

432
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:37,940
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Um, Kent.

433
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,191
- What?
- Kent.

434
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,068
- Oh. Clark Kent.
- Right.

435
01:04:41,236 --> 01:04:42,903
Jimmy Olsen.

436
01:04:58,378 --> 01:05:00,129
- Yeah. It's fantastic.
- So you...?

437
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,798
- I met this really great guy.
- Hey, fabulous.

438
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,967
Yeah, fabulous.
I met him at this dude ranch.

439
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:08,095
- Did you know I used to ride?
- Yeah, I've been since I was 7.

440
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:11,307
- Oh, I gotta mail these letters.
- Okay, bye. Good luck tonight.

441
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:12,975
- Oh, hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

442
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:14,977
How'd you like your first day on the job?

443
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:18,647
Well, frankly, the hours
were sort of longer than I expected...

444
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:22,318
...but on the whole, I mean, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

445
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,111
...gosh, I'd say it's been swell.

446
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:26,822
- Swell?
- Yeah.

447
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:32,328
You know, Clark, there are very few people
left in the world...

448
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,663
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

449
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:36,165
- What word?
- "Swell."

450
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,918
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

451
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:40,669
Ooh.

452
01:05:40,962 --> 01:05:43,255
- I'm sorry.
- Clark.

453
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,007
It's all right.

454
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:47,510
- Sorry, Lois.
- Oh, hi, Rex.

455
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,345
- Oh, Lois.
- See anything good today?

456
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:51,096
- Not until you came along.
- Lois?

457
01:05:51,264 --> 01:05:52,973
- Oh, Rex, this is...
- Clark Kent.

458
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:55,601
- Yeah, hi, see you around.
- Bye.

459
01:05:57,312 --> 01:06:00,272
- Lois?
- Hey, where you going?

460
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,108
- Can I help you with your coat?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

461
01:06:03,652 --> 01:06:06,028
- So you like Mr. White.
- I thought he was a nice guy.

462
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:08,864
- Jimmy Olsen was fantastic.
- Hey, come here.

463
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,492
Come on, come on. Get in here.
Hurry up. Come on.

464
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,703
- We'd better get out of here.
- I think we'd better do what he says.

465
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:18,040
- Come on, come on. Get in here, quick.
- Don't do anything.

466
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,625
- That's it.
- We're coming.

467
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:21,877
- Come on.
- We're coming. Excuse me.

468
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:23,295
- Go on, back there.
- Here?

469
01:06:23,463 --> 01:06:25,381
Please don't point that at me, sir.

470
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:27,883
- You could hurt somebody with that.
- Yeah, yeah.

471
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,886
- Okay, okay, hold it there.
- Just a minute, mister.

472
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:34,056
I realize of course that times are tough
for some these days...

473
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:35,724
...but this isn't the answer.

474
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:40,062
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

475
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:44,358
You know something, buddy? You're
right. I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

476
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:47,695
Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anybody.

477
01:06:47,862 --> 01:06:48,904
Uh-huh.

478
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:51,907
- Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
- Of course.

479
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,076
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

480
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,870
Lois, I think maybe you better...

481
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,419
Lois, what are you doing?

482
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,852
Clark! Clark.

483
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,230
Clark, are you all right? Clark!

484
01:07:23,398 --> 01:07:25,232
What happened?

485
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:27,610
Golly. I guess I must have fainted.

486
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,445
Fainted?

487
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:32,239
- You fainted?
- Sorry.

488
01:07:43,918 --> 01:07:45,294
Swell.

489
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:48,088
Oh, really, Lois, supposing that man
had shot you?

490
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:52,468
Is it worth risking your life over $10, two
credit cards, a hairbrush, and lipstick?

491
01:07:53,428 --> 01:07:55,971
- How'd you know that?
- Know what?

492
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,100
You just described the exact contents
of my purse.

493
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:01,977
Hm.

494
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:05,439
Um, wild guess.

495
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,985
Taxi!

496
01:08:51,444 --> 01:08:54,029
- Mustard, sauerkraut?
- Plain.

497
01:08:54,322 --> 01:08:57,199
- What, no mustard or sauerkraut?
- No, plain, man. Plain.

498
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,243
Here's a buck.
Go buy yourself a trip to Bermuda.

499
01:08:59,411 --> 01:09:00,411
Gee, thanks a lot.

500
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:05,165
- Hey.
- Hi, Otis.

501
01:09:15,427 --> 01:09:18,679
- So, what's happening, partner?
- Look what we got.

502
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:21,265
- Let's take him.
- Wait a minute.

503
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:24,268
Maybe he'll lead us
to the big man himself.

504
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:27,855
- Lex Luthor?
- You got it, Armus.

505
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,774
We'll make captain by midnight.

506
01:09:36,364 --> 01:09:39,950
Metropolis 46 to headquarters.
We have suspect under surveillance.

507
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:41,869
Let's go.

508
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,866
Hey, what do you read?

509
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:23,660
XK 101 rocket to be used.

510
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:25,370
Hey, what do you read?

511
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:27,122
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, hey, Otis.

512
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,500
Just getting the Daily Planet here.

513
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,670
Hey, what do you read?
Down, down.

514
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:35,547
Okay, okay.

515
01:10:35,757 --> 01:10:39,384
Okay. All right. See, I'm paying him.
I got a pretzel too.

516
01:10:39,552 --> 01:10:43,138
Thanks, Otis. Okay.
How many did he take, Shutzy?

517
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:49,144
Now arriving on track 10 upper level...

518
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:56,109
...the Yankee Clipper from Augusta, Boston,
Springfield, Hartford...

519
01:10:56,277 --> 01:10:59,154
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

520
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:00,864
Let's go.

521
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:07,663
Your attention, please.

522
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,706
Your attention, please.

523
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:16,505
Metropolis Railway is announcing
a delay of departure for the express...

524
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:22,010
...to Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis,
and Chicago.

525
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:29,518
That train will now depart on Track 28
lower level at 8:15.

526
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:34,106
No further delays are expected at this time.

527
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,745
Your attention, please.

528
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:50,581
Your attention, please.

529
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:54,209
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...

530
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:58,589
...on the upper level, Track 6,
stopping at New Rochelle.

531
01:11:58,756 --> 01:12:01,925
All right, he's going down to
the train platform. I'm going after him.

532
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:04,553
Okay, Harry. I'll call for backup.
Be careful, now.

533
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:07,097
- All right, Armus, all right.
- All aboard, please.

534
01:12:08,933 --> 01:12:11,435
Now boarding on the lower level...

535
01:12:11,603 --> 01:12:15,063
- Smoking cars forward, all aboard.
- Hey.

536
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:19,902
Metropolis Transportation. Metropolis
Transportation. Buffalo, Syracuse.

537
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,155
Come along, gotta get these cars going.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

538
01:12:23,364 --> 01:12:25,574
Ten minutes we leave, folks.
Ten minutes.

539
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:28,201
Metropolis Transportation, folks.
Hurry along, now.

540
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:30,621
All aboard. Boarding.

541
01:12:31,497 --> 01:12:33,832
Ten minutes, folks.
Come on, air-conditioned cars.

542
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,543
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie,
Glen Corners.

543
01:12:36,711 --> 01:12:39,212
Aboard now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation.

544
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,883
Metropolis Transportation.
Buffalo, Syracuse.

545
01:12:43,051 --> 01:12:45,886
Smoking cars are forward.
Move along now.

546
01:12:46,054 --> 01:12:47,471
Put your luggage up the top.

547
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:51,308
Smoking cars forward.
All aboard. Boarding.

548
01:13:26,344 --> 01:13:29,012
Armus, Armus, make it Track 22.

549
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:33,350
I seen him, and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

550
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:19,730
So that's it.

551
01:14:35,413 --> 01:14:40,292
Armus, come in please. Listen,
make it Track 23. Repeat, Track 23.

552
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,254
I watched him and I think
I know how he does it. Out.

553
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:12,324
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

554
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,826
Harry.

555
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,705
Harry, where are you? Harry.

556
01:16:08,506 --> 01:16:10,048
Oh, no.

557
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:18,431
Harry...

558
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,185
Sick.

559
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:33,989
- Sick. You're really sick.
- Sick, Miss Teschmacher?

560
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:37,409
Sick, when I'm mere days from executing
the crime of the century?

561
01:16:37,577 --> 01:16:40,537
No, no, no.
Step away from that, please.

562
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:45,584
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

563
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,420
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, no.

564
01:16:48,588 --> 01:16:50,922
That would be too obvious, I grant you.

565
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:54,759
Charismatic. Fiendishly gifted.

566
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:56,720
Try "twisted."

567
01:17:02,476 --> 01:17:05,103
Get away from there.
Get away, get away, get away!

568
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:08,106
Tell me something, Lex.

569
01:17:08,274 --> 01:17:11,193
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

570
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,111
Why? You ask why?

571
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,281
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

572
01:17:17,617 --> 01:17:21,536
Why is the most brilliantly
diabolical leader of our time...

573
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,788
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

574
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:25,874
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

575
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:28,627
Yes, I was just talking about you.

576
01:17:29,128 --> 01:17:30,795
You were followed again.

577
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:37,802
In spite of those catlike reflexes.

578
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:43,642
Mr. Luthor. Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

579
01:17:43,809 --> 01:17:45,310
Otis.

580
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,438
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

581
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:50,482
Yeah.

582
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,151
Why am I not reading it?

583
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:56,738
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

584
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:58,323
- Right.
- Oh.

585
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:04,996
At last, it's official.

586
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,667
Thanks to the generous help of the United
States government, we will pull off...

587
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:11,670
...the greatest real-estate swindle
of all time.

588
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:14,256
Lex, what is this obsession
with real estate?

589
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,341
All the time, "land, land, land."

590
01:18:16,509 --> 01:18:19,511
Miss Teschmacher, when I was
6 years old, my father said to me...

591
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:20,929
"Get out."

592
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:26,184
Before that. He said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall.

593
01:18:26,352 --> 01:18:28,687
Utilities and transportation systems
may collapse.

594
01:18:28,854 --> 01:18:31,773
People are no damn good.
But they will always need land...

595
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,192
...and they'll pay through the nose
to get it."

596
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,194
"Remember," my father said...

597
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:38,280
- Land.
- Right.

598
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:43,535
It's a pity that he didn't see
from such humble beginnings...

599
01:18:43,703 --> 01:18:45,370
...how I've created this empire.

600
01:18:45,538 --> 01:18:47,038
An empire? This?

601
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:50,375
Miss Teschmacher,
how many girls do you know...

602
01:18:50,584 --> 01:18:52,877
...who have a Park Avenue address
like this one?

603
01:18:53,045 --> 01:18:54,838
Park Avenue address?

604
01:18:55,006 --> 01:18:56,715
Two hundred feet below.

605
01:18:56,882 --> 01:18:59,551
Do you realize what people
are shelling out up there...

606
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:02,721
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator?

607
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:05,557
- What more could anyone ask?
- What more could anyone ask?

608
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:10,395
Sunshine? A night on the town
instead of under it?

609
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:17,235
- Otis?
- Yes?

610
01:19:17,403 --> 01:19:19,779
Did you feed the babies?

611
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:23,533
Not... Not today, Mr. Luthor.

612
01:19:23,701 --> 01:19:27,537
Otis, feed the babies.

613
01:19:27,705 --> 01:19:29,914
- Mr. Luthor, please.
- Otis!

614
01:19:40,968 --> 01:19:42,427
Relax.

615
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:19,339
Your babies weren't hungry, Mr. Luthor.

616
01:20:19,799 --> 01:20:24,135
Ugh. Lex, you're sick.

617
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:25,804
You are really sick.

618
01:20:25,971 --> 01:20:29,182
You would take a diaper pin
to cut a baby's throat.

619
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:32,185
You'd fix the brakes
on your own grandmother's wheelchair.

620
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,941
I don't know, just explain
one thing to me, Lex.

621
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:41,611
Why do I love you so much?

622
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:48,618
Because life with me is never dull.

623
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,791
No, it's never dull, Lex...

624
01:20:55,876 --> 01:20:58,586
...because you are the pits.

625
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:01,131
You're really the pits.

626
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:11,516
Later.

627
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:19,065
- Olsen!
- Yeah?

628
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:22,235
Get this Loch Ness update
right into Composing.

629
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:26,322
Yeah? No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

630
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:29,534
- What are you standing around here for?
- I'm not...

631
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:32,245
- I wasn't gonna say it.
- Go.

632
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:38,918
- Ah, the sex maniac profile.
- Right.

633
01:21:39,086 --> 01:21:41,754
Look, 9-to-5 it's a Pulitzer Prize winner.
What do you bet?

634
01:21:41,922 --> 01:21:43,673
There's no Z in "brassiere."

635
01:21:43,841 --> 01:21:46,092
Hey, nice job
on that union scandal, Kent.

636
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,428
Well, gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

637
01:21:51,348 --> 01:21:52,390
Uh...

638
01:21:52,558 --> 01:21:54,100
Oh, hi, Clark. Good night.

639
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:57,020
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

640
01:21:57,188 --> 01:21:59,230
Lois, have you got a minute?

641
01:21:59,398 --> 01:22:01,608
Excuse me, please. Lois?

642
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:05,111
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

643
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:08,239
Lois, I was wondering if you
would like to have dinner with me?

644
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:11,034
- Gosh, Clark, I'm sorry. I'm booked.
- Oh.

645
01:22:11,202 --> 01:22:14,078
Air Force One's landing at the airport
and this kid's there...

646
01:22:14,246 --> 01:22:17,916
...to make sure you-know-who answers
a few questions he'd rather duck.

647
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,543
- My goodness, don't you ever let up?
- What for?

648
01:22:20,711 --> 01:22:23,630
I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.

649
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:26,799
Three kids, two cats,
and one mortgage. Yech.

650
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:28,468
I would go bananas in a week.

651
01:22:28,636 --> 01:22:30,303
Oh, can I take you to the airport?

652
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:32,722
Not unless you can fly.

653
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:35,808
- Clark? Ladies.
- Sorry.

654
01:22:35,976 --> 01:22:39,312
- Change my clothes. Thank you. Bye.
- Hey, Lois, maybe we could...?

655
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:44,108
Um...

656
01:22:45,152 --> 01:22:46,569
Lois?

657
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:51,491
- Would you be a pet and mail that?
- Oh, sure... Good night.

658
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:59,624
Oh. Going down, please. Going down.

659
01:23:02,503 --> 01:23:05,338
- Going down?
- Going up, up, up.

660
01:23:07,007 --> 01:23:08,508
Good night.

661
01:23:19,812 --> 01:23:22,021
Daily Planet Copter 1, this is ground.

662
01:23:22,856 --> 01:23:24,524
Planet 1, go ahead.

663
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:30,154
We have Miss Lane for a ride to
Metropolis Airport to meet Air Force One.

664
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:33,241
Roger, we're on our way
and have you in sight.

665
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,577
Have one aboard for transfer, over.

666
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,164
Roger, Planet 1. You're cleared.
Wind, 020 at 15, gusting.

667
01:23:40,332 --> 01:23:41,624
Altimeter two-niner-eight-niner.

668
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:44,377
Roger, over and out.

669
01:25:03,248 --> 01:25:05,166
A malfunction. Can't get liftoff.

670
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:07,710
- You hooked the cable.
- What's happening?

671
01:25:08,545 --> 01:25:10,254
- Ah!
- Set it down.

672
01:25:10,422 --> 01:25:13,424
Oh, my God! We've lost stabilizer
rotor control, I can't hold it!

673
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:20,890
I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

674
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:39,951
Wake up!

675
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:44,747
Help!

676
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:47,792
Help! Help!

677
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:04,642
Come on, step back. Step back, folks.

678
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,979
- All right, let's get back a little.
- Move over across the street.

679
01:26:10,983 --> 01:26:12,650
Bring the cameras over here. Okay.

680
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:15,319
Okay, you see the helicopter up there?

681
01:26:21,827 --> 01:26:23,327
Help me!

682
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,504
All right, move back.
Let the ambulance through.

683
01:26:39,011 --> 01:26:40,511
Help me!

684
01:26:43,348 --> 01:26:44,640
Ah!

685
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,310
Okay. Come on, hold it. Get back.

686
01:26:51,023 --> 01:26:53,858
Come on. Come on, get off the streets.
Come on, get back.

687
01:26:54,026 --> 01:26:56,861
Move, let the firemen through.

688
01:26:57,029 --> 01:26:59,322
Boys, come on, now. Make a line.

689
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:06,704
Move to the other side of the street.

690
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,874
Come on. Get along.

691
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:11,375
Get away from the building.

692
01:27:14,004 --> 01:27:16,172
Hold these crowds back. Move. Move.

693
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,051
Help me!

694
01:27:35,734 --> 01:27:38,736
- Say, Jim, woo!
- Excuse me.

695
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:40,696
That's a bad outfit.

696
01:27:41,281 --> 01:27:43,866
- Woo!
- Okay, Bresslaw, move these people out.

697
01:27:53,293 --> 01:27:55,336
Oh, God, look up there.

698
01:27:56,755 --> 01:27:58,005
What the hell's that?

699
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:01,551
- Oh!
- Easy, miss. I've got you.

700
01:28:01,718 --> 01:28:03,427
You... You've got me?

701
01:28:03,595 --> 01:28:05,596
Who's got you?

702
01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:10,434
I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

703
01:28:55,147 --> 01:28:57,148
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

704
01:28:58,984 --> 01:29:02,987
Well, I certainly hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

705
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:08,367
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

706
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:11,078
Right. Wait.

707
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:17,335
Who are you?

708
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:19,503
A friend.

709
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:26,385
Bye.

710
01:31:32,137 --> 01:31:34,680
Hi there. Something wrong
with the elevator?

711
01:31:34,931 --> 01:31:36,390
Ah!

712
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:43,606
Going down.

713
01:31:50,363 --> 01:31:52,031
Nah.

714
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:56,952
Officer.

715
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:03,042
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

716
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:06,045
Well, they say confession
is good for the soul.

717
01:32:07,339 --> 01:32:09,381
I'd listen to this man.

718
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:11,383
Take him away.

719
01:32:56,346 --> 01:32:57,888
Come on. Let's get out of here.

720
01:33:08,191 --> 01:33:10,276
Move your ass. Come on. Come on.

721
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:12,945
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

722
01:33:13,113 --> 01:33:17,116
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons.

723
01:33:17,284 --> 01:33:19,076
Come on, let's get out of here.

724
01:33:19,244 --> 01:33:20,953
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

725
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:23,122
- Freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot.

726
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:24,915
Be cool. You got us.

727
01:33:49,566 --> 01:33:51,317
Bad vibrations?

728
01:33:51,484 --> 01:33:54,653
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear, flying.

729
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:57,114
With a big red cape
and bright red boots, as well.

730
01:33:57,282 --> 01:33:59,450
- Watch the desk.
- Quick as a wink, he was gone.

731
01:33:59,618 --> 01:34:02,494
Flew up in the air again, he did,
like a big blue bird.

732
01:34:02,662 --> 01:34:04,413
- A blue bird...
- You don't believe me.

733
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:06,332
- ...with bright red boots.
- Flying.

734
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:08,083
Take off, go back to Murphy's bar.

735
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:10,336
- Continue what you started.
- Don't believe me.

736
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:14,173
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there myself.

737
01:34:22,515 --> 01:34:26,018
Mooney, the first bottle's on me.

738
01:34:26,186 --> 01:34:27,645
Let me get my hat.

739
01:34:38,031 --> 01:34:40,282
Hey, Frisky,
will you come down from there.

740
01:34:40,784 --> 01:34:44,078
Hey, cat. Come on, Frisky,
come down!

741
01:34:44,246 --> 01:34:46,997
Come on down, you dumb cat.

742
01:34:47,165 --> 01:34:48,916
Come on.

743
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:52,002
Frisky, you dumb cat, will you
come down from there?

744
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:54,880
Come on, Frisky, come on.
Come down.

745
01:34:56,383 --> 01:34:58,133
Hi. I'll get him.

746
01:35:02,722 --> 01:35:04,723
Come on. It's all right.

747
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:07,476
Here you go, miss.

748
01:35:07,644 --> 01:35:10,354
Gee, thanks, mister.
He's such a naughty cat.

749
01:35:10,522 --> 01:35:12,439
- I always tell him not to...
- Hold on, now.

750
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:15,943
Let's not be too hard on Frisky, okay?
You know something...

751
01:35:16,111 --> 01:35:18,654
...we all get a little afraid of heights
now and again.

752
01:35:19,114 --> 01:35:20,114
Well...

753
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:23,200
...goodbye, Frisky. So long, now.

754
01:35:26,788 --> 01:35:30,291
- Bye.
- Bye.

755
01:35:31,126 --> 01:35:33,794
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

756
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:36,964
This man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

757
01:35:37,132 --> 01:35:40,301
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies?

758
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:49,935
Get a weather report
from Metropolis Airport.

759
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:53,439
Metropolis Airport,
this is Air Force One.

760
01:35:53,606 --> 01:35:56,150
- Could we have the weather report?
- Roger, Air Force One.

761
01:35:56,318 --> 01:35:58,569
Metropolis, currently
ceiling 500 overcast.

762
01:35:58,737 --> 01:36:00,654
700 broken,
visibility one half and showers.

763
01:36:00,822 --> 01:36:03,449
Wind 240 at 25,
altimeter niner-niner-eight.

764
01:36:03,616 --> 01:36:05,159
Roger.

765
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:07,703
Well, it doesn't look too good.
What do you think?

766
01:36:08,455 --> 01:36:10,331
No, it doesn't.

767
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:12,708
Yeah, and the old man hates bumpy,
that's great.

768
01:36:12,876 --> 01:36:16,295
- Better tell him to get rid of his drink.
- The old man drinks?

769
01:36:16,463 --> 01:36:19,173
After a mouthful of peanuts,
wouldn't you? Ha-ha-ha.

770
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,552
- What the hell was that?
- What happened?

771
01:36:23,803 --> 01:36:25,095
We lost power in number one.

772
01:36:25,263 --> 01:36:27,097
Lost power? We lost the whole engine.

773
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:29,892
- Shut down one.
- Pull one throttle closed.

774
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,603
- Bring up two and three.
- There's not enough pressure...

775
01:36:34,939 --> 01:36:38,275
Mayday, mayday, Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

776
01:36:38,443 --> 01:36:41,737
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

777
01:36:41,905 --> 01:36:44,615
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

778
01:36:44,783 --> 01:36:46,700
Ten miles southwest
of Metropolis Airport.

779
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:49,453
- Notify them the president's onboard.
- Position, 10 miles...

780
01:36:49,621 --> 01:36:52,289
...that's 10 miles southwest
Metropolis Airport.

781
01:36:52,457 --> 01:36:56,251
Heading 305. Height, 6000 feet.

782
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,148
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

783
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:20,317
What the hell's going on out there?

784
01:37:20,485 --> 01:37:23,737
Fly. Don't look. Just fly.

785
01:37:23,905 --> 01:37:25,823
We got something.

786
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:30,869
I ain't saying what it is. Just trust me.

787
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:50,139
You enjoyed it.

788
01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:54,643
I don't know what to say, Father.

789
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:56,854
I'm afraid I just got carried away.

790
01:37:57,063 --> 01:38:00,899
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.

791
01:38:01,067 --> 01:38:03,735
You couldn't have imagined...

792
01:38:04,195 --> 01:38:05,696
How good it felt?

793
01:38:08,241 --> 01:38:10,868
You are revealed to the world.

794
01:38:12,245 --> 01:38:14,705
Very well. So be it.

795
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:19,376
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

796
01:38:19,544 --> 01:38:20,586
Why?

797
01:38:21,004 --> 01:38:23,005
The reasons are two.

798
01:38:23,173 --> 01:38:26,383
First, you cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.

799
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,262
- 24.
- Or 24...

800
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:33,599
...as it is in Earth time.

801
01:38:33,892 --> 01:38:36,393
Your help would be called for endlessly.

802
01:38:36,561 --> 01:38:40,606
Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.

803
01:38:40,773 --> 01:38:44,443
It is their habit to abuse their resources
in such a way.

804
01:38:44,611 --> 01:38:45,777
And secondly?

805
01:38:45,945 --> 01:38:49,781
Second, your enemies will discover...

806
01:38:49,949 --> 01:38:52,117
...their only way to hurt you:

807
01:38:52,285 --> 01:38:54,578
By hurting the people you care for.

808
01:38:55,788 --> 01:38:57,122
Thank you, Father.

809
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,751
Lastly...

810
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:05,506
...do not punish yourself
for your feelings of vanity.

811
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,508
Simply learn to control them.

812
01:39:07,926 --> 01:39:11,595
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

813
01:39:11,763 --> 01:39:14,973
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...

814
01:39:15,141 --> 01:39:18,352
...who consider us indestructible.

815
01:39:19,395 --> 01:39:22,231
Were it not for vanity, why...

816
01:39:24,025 --> 01:39:26,527
...at this very moment...

817
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:33,033
...I could embrace you in my arms...

818
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,583
...my son.

819
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:20,122
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving...

820
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:22,499
- ...of Air Force One...
- A burglar was apprehended...

821
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:26,128
- ...by a man in a blue suit and red cape.
- ...rescuing Miss Lois Lane...

822
01:40:26,296 --> 01:40:29,214
...writer on the Daily Planet,
with one hand, and a...

823
01:40:34,637 --> 01:40:37,639
Yeah, that'll be the day, huh?

824
01:40:37,807 --> 01:40:40,726
I said, that'll be the day
when a guy could fly, huh?

825
01:40:40,893 --> 01:40:44,021
Oh, I don't know. You'd be surprised.

826
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:47,691
- Yeah.
- Some sort of fantastic hoax.

827
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:49,568
Your guess is as good as anybody's.

828
01:40:49,736 --> 01:40:52,237
True or false, miracle or fraud?

829
01:40:52,405 --> 01:40:55,365
- The answer is up to you. Man or myth?
- Miss Teschmacher!

830
01:40:55,533 --> 01:40:57,117
Turn it off.

831
01:41:06,252 --> 01:41:09,838
Mr. Luthor? What's a myth?

832
01:41:10,006 --> 01:41:13,592
Something unreal.
Something not quite human.

833
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,761
Something like you, Otis.

834
01:41:17,096 --> 01:41:18,930
I'm a myth.

835
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,441
Lex, what's the story on this guy?

836
01:41:29,609 --> 01:41:31,485
Do you think he's the genuine article?

837
01:41:31,653 --> 01:41:34,821
- If he is, he's not from this world.
- Why?

838
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:38,158
If any human being were gonna perpetrate
such a fantastic hoax...

839
01:41:38,326 --> 01:41:40,202
...it would have been me.

840
01:41:49,003 --> 01:41:52,005
Otis! My robe!

841
01:41:54,133 --> 01:41:56,677
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

842
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:00,430
It all fits somehow,
his coming here to Metropolis...

843
01:42:01,349 --> 01:42:03,725
...and at this particular time.

844
01:42:06,979 --> 01:42:09,481
There's kind of a cruel justice about it.

845
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:17,864
Miss Teschmacher, you look so pretty today.

846
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:20,200
I'm gonna take your picture.

847
01:42:22,203 --> 01:42:24,121
Smile.

848
01:42:29,001 --> 01:42:30,836
There you go.

849
01:42:31,504 --> 01:42:33,255
Otis!

850
01:42:36,008 --> 01:42:37,843
To commit the crime of the century...

851
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:41,471
...a man would just naturally want to face
the challenge of the century.

852
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:47,310
Listen, Mr. Luthor, maybe this guy that
flies is just sort of passing through.

853
01:42:47,478 --> 01:42:49,855
- You know?
- Passing through?

854
01:42:50,064 --> 01:42:51,857
Not on your life, Otis...

855
01:42:52,024 --> 01:42:54,526
...which I would gladly sacrifice,
by the way...

856
01:42:54,694 --> 01:42:58,864
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

857
01:42:59,866 --> 01:43:01,700
And, Otis, by the way...

858
01:43:01,868 --> 01:43:05,370
...the next time, put my robe on
after I'm out of the pool.

859
01:43:07,248 --> 01:43:09,332
Mr... I'm sor...

860
01:43:19,886 --> 01:43:22,637
Now look. The Post: "It flies."

861
01:43:22,805 --> 01:43:25,140
The News: "Look, Ma, no wires."

862
01:43:25,308 --> 01:43:27,267
The Times: "Blue bomb buzzes
Metropolis."

863
01:43:27,435 --> 01:43:28,477
The Planet:

864
01:43:28,644 --> 01:43:31,646
We have the story of the century here.

865
01:43:31,814 --> 01:43:33,774
I want the name of
this whatchamacallit...

866
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,109
...to go with the Planet
like bacon and eggs...

867
01:43:36,277 --> 01:43:39,237
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

868
01:43:39,405 --> 01:43:41,323
I don't think that
he would lend himself...

869
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:43,492
...to any cheap promotion schemes,
Mr. White.

870
01:43:43,659 --> 01:43:45,827
Exactly how would you know that, Kent?

871
01:43:45,995 --> 01:43:47,245
Um...

872
01:43:48,164 --> 01:43:49,998
Just a first impression.

873
01:43:50,166 --> 01:43:52,584
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him partner if I have to.

874
01:43:52,752 --> 01:43:54,461
- Right?
- Right, chief.

875
01:43:56,047 --> 01:43:57,506
I want the real story.

876
01:43:57,673 --> 01:44:00,008
I want the inside dope on this guy.

877
01:44:00,176 --> 01:44:03,845
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the S stand for?

878
01:44:04,055 --> 01:44:06,348
"Tonight at 8, your place.
Hopefully, a friend."

879
01:44:06,557 --> 01:44:07,682
How does he fly?

880
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,351
A friend?

881
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:15,148
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

882
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:17,651
What's he got hidden under
that cape? Batteries?

883
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:19,194
Why did he show up last night?

884
01:44:19,362 --> 01:44:21,530
Dick, where does he come from?

885
01:44:21,697 --> 01:44:22,989
Does he have a girlfriend?

886
01:44:25,535 --> 01:44:27,202
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

887
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:30,205
Now, listen to me.
I tell you, boys and girls...

888
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:32,374
...whichever one of you
gets it out of him...

889
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:35,460
...is gonna wind up with
the single most important interview...

890
01:44:35,628 --> 01:44:39,381
...since God talked to Moses.

891
01:44:42,218 --> 01:44:44,052
What are you standing around about for?

892
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:47,556
Move. Get on that story.

893
01:44:47,723 --> 01:44:50,559
Let me tell you something, Vinnie.
A good reporter doesn't get great stories...

894
01:44:50,726 --> 01:44:52,811
- ...a good reporter makes them great.
- Oh, yeah?

895
01:44:52,979 --> 01:44:55,272
- Olsen!
- Yeah. Chief wants me.

896
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:57,274
- Yeah, chief?
- Black, no sugar.

897
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:05,198
Black, no sugar! You heard him.

898
01:45:07,702 --> 01:45:08,702
Sheesh.

899
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:22,799
"Eight o'clock," he says, 8:00, 8:00.

900
01:45:22,967 --> 01:45:24,467
Some friend.

901
01:45:25,261 --> 01:45:28,471
The story of my life.
Cinderella bites the dust.

902
01:45:40,818 --> 01:45:42,152
Good evening, Miss Lane.

903
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:47,115
Uh, hi.

904
01:45:47,283 --> 01:45:49,326
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you have plans this evening?

905
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:51,828
Oh. Oh, this old thing... No.

906
01:45:51,996 --> 01:45:55,999
- It's no trouble at all to come later.
- No. Don't move!

907
01:45:56,167 --> 01:45:58,293
Um... Or...

908
01:45:59,128 --> 01:46:00,962
Sure, you can move.

909
01:46:01,505 --> 01:46:03,298
Just don't fly away, all right?

910
01:46:04,175 --> 01:46:06,343
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
Miss Lane...

911
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,929
...but there must be a lot
of questions about me...

912
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:12,474
- ...that people would like the answers to.
- Of course, yes.

913
01:46:18,064 --> 01:46:20,190
You really shouldn't smoke,
you know, Miss Lane.

914
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:24,027
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

915
01:46:26,197 --> 01:46:28,198
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

916
01:46:30,493 --> 01:46:33,036
Um, would you like a glass of wine?

917
01:46:33,204 --> 01:46:35,372
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

918
01:46:36,707 --> 01:46:38,041
Nice place.

919
01:46:38,209 --> 01:46:41,378
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

920
01:46:41,671 --> 01:46:44,464
Should we get started
with the interview?

921
01:46:46,217 --> 01:46:48,593
Oh. Thank you.

922
01:46:49,303 --> 01:46:52,514
Well, let's start with your vital statistics.

923
01:46:52,682 --> 01:46:54,474
Are you married?

924
01:46:54,642 --> 01:46:56,226
No. No, I'm not.

925
01:46:57,103 --> 01:46:58,895
Do you have a girlfriend?

926
01:46:59,063 --> 01:47:03,066
No, I don't, but if I did, Miss Lane,
you'd be the first to know about it.

927
01:47:08,698 --> 01:47:10,824
Um, how old are you?

928
01:47:10,992 --> 01:47:13,410
- Over 21.
- Oh, I get it.

929
01:47:13,577 --> 01:47:15,412
You don't want anyone to
know how old... Okay.

930
01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:18,248
How big are you? How tall are you?

931
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,834
- About 6'4".
- Six-foot-four.

932
01:47:21,002 --> 01:47:24,921
- And how much do you weigh?
- Around 2, 225.

933
01:47:25,506 --> 01:47:27,924
Two... 225?

934
01:47:30,136 --> 01:47:31,511
Hm.

935
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:37,225
Well, I assume, then, that...

936
01:47:37,601 --> 01:47:41,604
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

937
01:47:42,273 --> 01:47:43,606
Sorry. I beg your pardon?

938
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:46,943
Well, putting it delicately...

939
01:47:50,948 --> 01:47:52,866
...do you...

940
01:47:55,411 --> 01:47:56,953
...eat?

941
01:47:57,121 --> 01:48:00,290
Yes. Yes, I do. When I'm hungry.

942
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:03,960
You do. Of course you do.

943
01:48:04,128 --> 01:48:07,130
Well. Well, then, is it true...

944
01:48:07,298 --> 01:48:11,551
...that you can see through anything?

945
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:14,220
Yes, I can. Well, pretty much.

946
01:48:14,388 --> 01:48:17,974
And that you're totally
impervious to pain?

947
01:48:18,142 --> 01:48:19,976
Well, so far.

948
01:48:20,936 --> 01:48:23,480
What color underwear am I wearing?

949
01:48:24,273 --> 01:48:25,565
Hm.

950
01:48:27,276 --> 01:48:29,319
- I'm sorry. I embarrassed you, didn't I?
- No.

951
01:48:29,487 --> 01:48:31,112
- I did.
- No, no. Not at all.

952
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,491
It's just that this planter must be
made of lead.

953
01:48:34,658 --> 01:48:36,910
- Yes, it is. So?
- Oh, you see, I...

954
01:48:37,078 --> 01:48:39,287
...I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

955
01:48:39,997 --> 01:48:41,915
Oh, that's interesting.

956
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:44,000
"Problems seeing through lead."

957
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:47,796
- Do you have a first name?
- What, like Ralph or something?

958
01:48:47,963 --> 01:48:49,672
- No. I mean like...
- Pink.

959
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,175
- Huh?
- Pink.

960
01:48:54,345 --> 01:48:56,805
I'm sorry, Miss Lane.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

961
01:48:57,306 --> 01:48:59,641
You didn't embarrass me.

962
01:48:59,809 --> 01:49:01,851
Um... Uh...

963
01:49:02,019 --> 01:49:04,187
What's your background?
Where do you hail from?

964
01:49:05,523 --> 01:49:07,857
Well, that's kind of
hard to explain, actually.

965
01:49:08,025 --> 01:49:11,653
You see, I'm from...
Well, pretty far away.

966
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,530
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.

967
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:16,199
- I come from a planet called Krypton.
- Huh?

968
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,034
Krypton.

969
01:49:19,036 --> 01:49:23,540
Oh, Cripton. With a C-R-I...? No.

970
01:49:23,707 --> 01:49:27,335
No, actually, it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

971
01:49:27,503 --> 01:49:32,382
K-R-Y... Do you like pink?

972
01:49:37,555 --> 01:49:39,973
I like pink very much, Lois.

973
01:49:43,894 --> 01:49:46,396
- Why are you...?
- I'm sorry?

974
01:49:46,897 --> 01:49:50,733
I mean, why are you here? There
must be a reason for you to be here.

975
01:49:50,901 --> 01:49:54,904
Yes. I'm here to fight for truth
and justice and the American way.

976
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:58,908
You're gonna end up fighting
every elected official in this country.

977
01:49:59,076 --> 01:50:01,077
I'm sure you don't really mean that, Lois.

978
01:50:01,245 --> 01:50:02,745
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

979
01:50:02,913 --> 01:50:05,915
- Hm?
- I never lie.

980
01:50:07,418 --> 01:50:09,335
Oh.

981
01:50:10,296 --> 01:50:11,588
Um...

982
01:50:12,506 --> 01:50:13,756
Uh... Oh.

983
01:50:13,924 --> 01:50:17,260
- Just how fast do you fly, by the way?
- I don't know, really.

984
01:50:17,428 --> 01:50:20,013
You know, I never actually bothered
to time myself.

985
01:50:20,181 --> 01:50:22,348
- No?
- Say...

986
01:50:23,434 --> 01:50:25,268
...why don't we find out?

987
01:50:25,436 --> 01:50:27,854
And how do you propose we do that?

988
01:50:28,022 --> 01:50:29,606
Take a ride with me?

989
01:50:29,773 --> 01:50:31,191
You mean I can fly?

990
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:33,776
Actually, I'd be handling the flying,
if that's okay.

991
01:50:33,944 --> 01:50:37,113
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

992
01:50:37,281 --> 01:50:39,449
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

993
01:50:40,242 --> 01:50:41,910
What's the matter, don't you want to go?

994
01:50:42,077 --> 01:50:44,204
Okay. You don't need these.

995
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:46,539
I need a sweater.
It must be kind of cold.

996
01:50:46,707 --> 01:50:48,541
No, you'll be warm enough.

997
01:50:54,632 --> 01:50:56,966
- Ready?
- Clark...

998
01:50:57,134 --> 01:51:01,471
...said that you're just a figment
of somebody's imagination...

999
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:03,139
...like Peter Pan.

1000
01:51:03,307 --> 01:51:05,892
Clark. Who's that, your boyfriend?

1001
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,144
Clark? Oh, Clark. No, he's nothing.

1002
01:51:08,312 --> 01:51:09,604
- He's just a...
- Peter Pan, huh?

1003
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:11,147
Uh-huh.

1004
01:51:11,982 --> 01:51:16,152
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

1005
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:24,077
Ah!

1006
01:51:26,497 --> 01:51:28,081
Oh!

1007
01:54:11,787 --> 01:54:13,830
Oh! Ah!

1008
01:54:32,349 --> 01:54:35,184
Can you read my mind?

1009
01:54:39,356 --> 01:54:42,442
Do you know what it is
that you do to me?

1010
01:54:45,028 --> 01:54:47,530
I don't know who you are.

1011
01:54:52,536 --> 01:54:55,538
Just a friend from another star.

1012
01:54:59,042 --> 01:55:02,462
Here I am, like a kid out of school...

1013
01:55:03,338 --> 01:55:06,048
...holding hands with a god.

1014
01:55:06,967 --> 01:55:08,718
I'm a fool.

1015
01:55:10,053 --> 01:55:13,890
Will you look at me, quivering.

1016
01:55:14,057 --> 01:55:16,893
Like a little girl, shivering.

1017
01:55:17,227 --> 01:55:19,729
You can see right through me.

1018
01:55:24,318 --> 01:55:27,028
Can you read my mind?

1019
01:55:29,656 --> 01:55:32,408
Can you picture the things
I'm thinking of?

1020
01:55:36,914 --> 01:55:38,998
Wondering why you are...

1021
01:55:40,709 --> 01:55:42,919
...all the wonderful things you are.

1022
01:55:46,089 --> 01:55:47,757
You can fly.

1023
01:55:49,092 --> 01:55:50,760
You belong in the sky.

1024
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:54,263
You and I...

1025
01:55:56,058 --> 01:55:58,434
...could belong to each other.

1026
01:56:00,938 --> 01:56:03,064
If you need a friend...

1027
01:56:06,109 --> 01:56:08,569
...I'm the one to fly to.

1028
01:56:12,533 --> 01:56:14,784
If you need to be loved...

1029
01:56:16,286 --> 01:56:18,287
...here I am.

1030
01:56:19,248 --> 01:56:21,290
Read my mind.

1031
01:56:42,729 --> 01:56:44,981
Oh, we forgot to time ourselves.

1032
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,232
Uh-huh.

1033
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,609
Oh, well, maybe next time.

1034
01:56:49,444 --> 01:56:50,486
Oh.

1035
01:56:57,744 --> 01:56:59,954
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

1036
01:57:01,665 --> 01:57:04,125
Well, good night.

1037
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:06,794
Oh, good night.

1038
01:57:11,425 --> 01:57:14,010
What a super man.

1039
01:57:19,516 --> 01:57:21,767
Superman.

1040
01:57:23,312 --> 01:57:25,938
Lois? Lois?

1041
01:57:26,106 --> 01:57:30,735
Anybody home? Hello? Lois?

1042
01:57:35,949 --> 01:57:38,993
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

1043
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:42,204
Lois, for goodness' sake,
did you even hear me knocking?

1044
01:57:42,372 --> 01:57:43,539
Uh-huh.

1045
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:47,168
Lois, we did have a date tonight,
remember?

1046
01:57:47,336 --> 01:57:48,544
Oh.

1047
01:57:49,046 --> 01:57:53,341
- Lois? You haven't been...
- Oh, no, no.

1048
01:57:53,508 --> 01:57:58,054
Well, I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

1049
01:57:58,221 --> 01:57:59,555
- I'd better get a coat.
- Okay.

1050
01:57:59,723 --> 01:58:02,683
It might be kind of cold out.
No, I mean...

1051
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:06,479
...I need a purse, and I have to
fix my hair, and...

1052
01:58:06,647 --> 01:58:08,648
...put some blush on...

1053
01:58:24,498 --> 01:58:26,082
Lois...

1054
01:58:26,416 --> 01:58:29,752
...there's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

1055
01:58:32,172 --> 01:58:37,009
I mean, I was, at first,
really nervous about tonight.

1056
01:58:37,427 --> 01:58:41,389
But then I decided, well, darn it, I was
gonna show you the time of your life.

1057
01:58:41,556 --> 01:58:43,599
That's Clark, nice.

1058
01:58:46,103 --> 01:58:48,729
I was thinking maybe we could go
for a hamburger.

1059
01:58:55,529 --> 01:58:57,113
Now, then...

1060
01:58:58,115 --> 01:59:01,701
...given the exact location of the galaxy
that he mentions...

1061
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:05,955
...and the proximity
to our own solar system...

1062
01:59:07,791 --> 01:59:09,709
...it's amazing.

1063
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:12,628
Amazing. Too good to be true.

1064
01:59:12,796 --> 01:59:15,589
It's too good to be true.
He's 6'4", has black hair...

1065
01:59:15,757 --> 01:59:18,926
...blue eyes, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke,
and tells the truth.

1066
01:59:19,094 --> 01:59:21,595
Miss Teschmacher, some people read
War and Peace...

1067
01:59:21,763 --> 01:59:24,640
...and come away thinking
it's a simple adventure story.

1068
01:59:24,808 --> 01:59:27,601
Others can read the ingredients
on a chewing gum wrapper...

1069
01:59:27,769 --> 01:59:30,354
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

1070
01:59:31,106 --> 01:59:34,984
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

1071
01:59:38,155 --> 01:59:40,156
Right. Right, Miss Teschmacher.

1072
01:59:43,285 --> 01:59:45,286
N, N, N...

1073
01:59:45,454 --> 01:59:48,164
M. You want M, Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

1074
01:59:49,583 --> 01:59:51,292
So there you go. M.

1075
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:54,170
M, as in "moron," Otis?
No, no, no. It's N!

1076
01:59:54,337 --> 01:59:57,631
N, as in "Neanderthal,"
"nincompoop," "nitwit."

1077
01:59:57,799 --> 02:00:00,676
- And L, as in "ladder"!
- Ladder, Mr. Luthor. Coming right up.

1078
02:00:00,844 --> 02:00:03,262
I didn't see, because I...

1079
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,307
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor. I... Ooh!

1080
02:00:06,475 --> 02:00:10,686
In the interview,
he says that the planet Krypton...

1081
02:00:11,521 --> 02:00:14,356
...exploded in 1948.

1082
02:00:14,524 --> 02:00:19,528
Ridiculous little freak took three years
in a rocket ship to get to Earth.

1083
02:00:19,696 --> 02:00:25,159
- Ergo...
- Ergo. Ergo, 1948, three years...

1084
02:00:25,327 --> 02:00:28,329
- He's 6'4", you know that?
- I said that.

1085
02:00:28,497 --> 02:00:30,706
Did you say he don't drink
and he don't smoke?

1086
02:00:30,874 --> 02:00:33,375
I said that. It was in the paper
right there. I said it.

1087
02:00:33,543 --> 02:00:37,213
Do you know why the number 200
is so vitally descriptive...

1088
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:40,174
...to both you and me?
It's your weight and my IQ.

1089
02:00:40,342 --> 02:00:42,551
Now, think, people, think.

1090
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:46,222
Deductive reasoning,
that's the name of the game.

1091
02:00:48,391 --> 02:00:52,853
Fragments from the planet Krypton
exploded and went into outer space.

1092
02:00:53,021 --> 02:00:57,066
It is reasonable to assume
that some of those particles of debris...

1093
02:00:57,234 --> 02:00:59,068
...drifted to Earth.

1094
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:02,029
Meteorites.

1095
02:01:05,242 --> 02:01:07,243
Voila!

1096
02:01:12,249 --> 02:01:13,415
Voila.

1097
02:01:13,583 --> 02:01:15,668
Voila.

1098
02:01:17,712 --> 02:01:20,172
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

1099
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:25,302
Uh, I know I'm gonna get rapped
in the mouth for this, but so what?

1100
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:29,223
So what? You mean, to us
they are just meteorites.

1101
02:01:29,391 --> 02:01:34,353
Fair enough. But the level
of specific radioactivity is so high...

1102
02:01:34,521 --> 02:01:38,065
...to anyone from the planet Krypton,
this substance is lethal.

1103
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,734
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

1104
02:01:40,902 --> 02:01:45,030
You mean fire and bullets
can't hurt this guy, but this stuff here...

1105
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:47,575
Will kill him.

1106
02:01:47,742 --> 02:01:49,076
- Oh.
- Oh.

1107
02:01:49,244 --> 02:01:50,744
Yeah, wow...

1108
02:01:50,912 --> 02:01:52,663
Doesn't it give you kind of...

1109
02:01:52,831 --> 02:01:56,917
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

1110
02:01:58,086 --> 02:02:01,171
Not like the one you'll get
when you try to lay that rock on him.

1111
02:02:01,339 --> 02:02:04,592
He can see you coming from miles
with those super peepers of his.

1112
02:02:04,759 --> 02:02:08,596
Oh, Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see.

1113
02:02:08,763 --> 02:02:11,140
Nor can Superman, through lead.

1114
02:02:12,934 --> 02:02:15,603
He can't see through lead.

1115
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:17,938
And kryptonite will destroy him.

1116
02:02:21,276 --> 02:02:23,235
Any questions, class?

1117
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:26,780
Wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa.

1118
02:02:26,948 --> 02:02:28,365
Looks like a burnoose.

1119
02:02:28,575 --> 02:02:30,618
There's gold. It's 24 karat...

1120
02:02:30,785 --> 02:02:34,038
- Are we going to Addis Ababa?
- ...not 18 karat gold.

1121
02:02:34,456 --> 02:02:36,957
Mother Bird to missile convoy. Over.

1122
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:39,627
Missile convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

1123
02:02:39,794 --> 02:02:44,048
Everything looks good.
See you at base. Over and out.

1124
02:02:44,215 --> 02:02:46,926
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

1125
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:49,738
Mr. Otis, do you live in England?

1126
02:03:49,948 --> 02:03:52,324
I... I don't think so, Mr. Luthor.

1127
02:03:52,492 --> 02:03:55,035
Why are you driving on the left side?

1128
02:04:06,965 --> 02:04:08,215
Ready, Miss Teschmacher?

1129
02:04:10,093 --> 02:04:12,761
Have you ever tried running in high heels?

1130
02:04:14,472 --> 02:04:16,056
He probably has.

1131
02:05:02,687 --> 02:05:04,980
God, what a mess.

1132
02:05:06,316 --> 02:05:08,984
- What?
- I don't know, man.

1133
02:05:09,152 --> 02:05:12,321
Yeah, I'm gonna get a call to headquarters.
See if we can get an ambulance here.

1134
02:05:12,489 --> 02:05:13,906
Uh, this is Charlie-Baker-Four...

1135
02:05:24,417 --> 02:05:28,128
- Man, look at this.
- Looks pretty bad.

1136
02:05:30,507 --> 02:05:33,926
- Think she's dead?
- Better check her pulse.

1137
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:45,604
All right, get an ambulance down here.

1138
02:05:45,772 --> 02:05:48,440
I don't wanna hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

1139
02:05:48,942 --> 02:05:51,610
She's having trouble breathing, sir.
What do you think?

1140
02:05:51,778 --> 02:05:54,279
Well, I suggest vigorous chest massage.

1141
02:05:54,447 --> 02:05:57,116
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

1142
02:05:57,283 --> 02:05:58,742
Yes, sir.

1143
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:02,454
Sergeant, I won't have one of my men
doing anything I wouldn't do myself.

1144
02:06:02,622 --> 02:06:04,748
- Yeah, but, sir...
- Get an ambulance.

1145
02:06:04,916 --> 02:06:06,917
All right, men. Gather around.

1146
02:06:07,627 --> 02:06:09,670
About face!

1147
02:06:20,181 --> 02:06:21,598
Ow!

1148
02:06:28,982 --> 02:06:32,442
Hup! Two, three, four.
Hup! Two, three, four.

1149
02:06:56,801 --> 02:07:00,345
Enough. Enough, enough, enough!
I'm okay now. I'm okay.

1150
02:07:00,513 --> 02:07:03,974
By the way, what did you have for lunch?
Whew!

1151
02:07:04,142 --> 02:07:05,559
- My, my.
- Sorry.

1152
02:07:08,146 --> 02:07:10,439
Hi.
Somebody hurt?

1153
02:07:10,607 --> 02:07:13,192
- Well, that was fast.
- Fast?

1154
02:07:14,527 --> 02:07:16,945
When this woman's life is at stake?

1155
02:07:20,325 --> 02:07:22,075
Let's see here...

1156
02:07:24,162 --> 02:07:25,704
- You have a stretcher?
- Get a stretcher.

1157
02:07:25,872 --> 02:07:27,456
- Get a stretcher.
- Get a stretcher.

1158
02:07:27,624 --> 02:07:31,043
- Get a stretcher.
- Get a stretcher! Go on, you guys!

1159
02:07:31,502 --> 02:07:34,463
- Anything I can do?
- Oh, I think you've already done it.

1160
02:07:34,631 --> 02:07:38,008
- Oh, yeah?
- She's gonna be all right.

1161
02:07:38,176 --> 02:07:41,220
- I don't feel too good.
- Miss Teschmacher...

1162
02:07:41,387 --> 02:07:45,474
- ...you've done very well.
- I've done very well.

1163
02:07:45,934 --> 02:07:47,726
I said that.

1164
02:08:42,865 --> 02:08:47,244
I did it. I did it, Mr. Luthor,
Miss Teschmacher.

1165
02:08:47,412 --> 02:08:50,706
- I did it, just like you told me.
- All right, Otis. All right.

1166
02:08:50,873 --> 02:08:54,710
All right, Otis. Listen,
it isn't that I don't trust you, but...

1167
02:08:54,877 --> 02:08:57,254
I don't trust you, Otis. What'd you do?

1168
02:08:57,422 --> 02:09:03,885
Well, I... I set the first directional vector
to 38...

1169
02:09:04,053 --> 02:09:08,098
...the second one to 67,
and the third one to 117.

1170
02:09:08,266 --> 02:09:11,351
- What about the fourth one?
- What fourth one?

1171
02:09:11,519 --> 02:09:14,771
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The third one to 117?

1172
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:17,274
Yes. See? I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
I wrote it...

1173
02:09:17,442 --> 02:09:19,693
Otis. Otis!

1174
02:09:19,861 --> 02:09:23,447
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, seven.

1175
02:09:23,656 --> 02:09:27,409
Oh. Well, gee, Mr. Luthor.

1176
02:09:27,577 --> 02:09:30,120
Oh, I see. I guess my arm
wasn't long enough, see?

1177
02:09:30,288 --> 02:09:32,789
Otis, would you like to see a long arm?

1178
02:09:32,957 --> 02:09:35,917
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very long arm?

1179
02:09:36,085 --> 02:09:39,296
- Oh, no, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis. Otis!

1180
02:09:39,464 --> 02:09:40,630
Ah!

1181
02:09:41,674 --> 02:09:45,010
- My marshmallow!
- Leave me alone! Give me your arm, Otis.

1182
02:09:45,178 --> 02:09:50,098
Hand it over! I'll wring your neck!
I'll give you a long arm!

1183
02:10:17,668 --> 02:10:21,755
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1184
02:10:21,923 --> 02:10:23,965
- I... I just got... I got mixed up.
- It's all right.

1185
02:10:24,133 --> 02:10:26,093
- I'll go in there and fix that thing.
- It's okay.

1186
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:29,679
It's okay, Otis, it's okay.

1187
02:10:29,972 --> 02:10:33,266
There's another XK 101 being launched
at the same time.

1188
02:10:33,434 --> 02:10:36,144
See? There's another XK 101 being launched
at exactly the same time.

1189
02:10:36,312 --> 02:10:38,647
- I just said that.
- No, she said there was a XK 101...

1190
02:10:38,815 --> 02:10:41,066
...being launched at "exactly" the same time,
Mr. Luthor.

1191
02:10:41,275 --> 02:10:44,111
- Don't tell me that.
- But there is another XK 101 being launched...

1192
02:10:44,278 --> 02:10:46,780
- ...at exactly the same time.
- I told you not to tell me that!

1193
02:10:46,948 --> 02:10:51,827
Oh, no, no, no. Mr. Luthor, please.
She didn't mean it. Miss Teschmacher...

1194
02:10:57,917 --> 02:11:00,168
Shut up in there!

1195
02:11:11,764 --> 02:11:14,057
Mr. Luthor, are you mad?

1196
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:18,520
- You did it again, Otis.
- Miss Teschmacher, I think you did.

1197
02:11:20,815 --> 02:11:23,650
- I know! But he didn't say "exactly."
- But he always hits me!

1198
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:03,815
Mr. Luthor, come on. Let me do it again.
I can get it right.

1199
02:12:03,983 --> 02:12:06,067
- Otis!
- I got experience now.

1200
02:12:06,235 --> 02:12:11,656
Otis, how would you like the heady experience
of being thrown from a moving vehicle?

1201
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,075
You want a bite of that?

1202
02:12:31,052 --> 02:12:34,846
- All right, get it right, will you?
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1203
02:12:37,308 --> 02:12:39,976
McDonald, I thought you told me
this road was blocked off.

1204
02:12:40,144 --> 02:12:43,522
- Jablonski, you said it was blocked.
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.

1205
02:12:44,732 --> 02:12:47,359
All right, follow me. Follow me, men.

1206
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:51,404
- Back that thing off the road.
- Back that thing up out of here.

1207
02:12:51,572 --> 02:12:52,822
Off the road!

1208
02:12:54,992 --> 02:12:57,661
Back it off the road, we got a convoy.

1209
02:13:04,961 --> 02:13:07,796
You fellas get back into that thing
and back it off the road.

1210
02:13:07,964 --> 02:13:10,257
We got a convoy coming through here.

1211
02:13:11,801 --> 02:13:14,970
Listen, you're gonna have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

1212
02:13:15,137 --> 02:13:16,721
Heck of a day, isn't it?

1213
02:13:19,809 --> 02:13:23,979
We took the wrong turn.
We were looking for Route 12.

1214
02:13:24,146 --> 02:13:27,649
- Route 12? That's back there, isn't it?
- No, sir. It's up there.

1215
02:13:29,485 --> 02:13:33,321
- Sergeant, we took the wrong route.
- I'm a lieutenant, a naval officer.

1216
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:42,247
Shut up!

1217
02:13:42,415 --> 02:13:44,165
Route 12 is back that way.

1218
02:13:50,506 --> 02:13:54,259
This man is a diabetic, you see.
And he has to have his insulin.

1219
02:13:54,427 --> 02:13:57,637
- What's he eating chocolate for?
- Well, it gives him a lot of sugar.

1220
02:13:57,805 --> 02:13:59,723
- Yeah.
- All right, now listen, fellas.

1221
02:13:59,890 --> 02:14:02,642
Back out here, go back a few miles,
pull off...

1222
02:14:15,698 --> 02:14:18,450
- Just back up, we'll open an exit.
- Can't we get past you here?

1223
02:15:06,874 --> 02:15:09,250
Tell me, chief, what do you think
about all of this?

1224
02:15:09,418 --> 02:15:15,674
No oil, no uranium, no coal,
no precious minerals.

1225
02:15:15,841 --> 02:15:20,303
Hell, no water anymore.
Not since the government dammed it all up...

1226
02:15:20,471 --> 02:15:25,016
...to service those towns
on the other side of the mountain.

1227
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:29,437
- If we still had water, we would never sell...
- Mm-hm.

1228
02:15:29,605 --> 02:15:32,899
- ...our beloved land.
- Well my, uh...

1229
02:15:33,067 --> 02:15:35,235
My associate, Mr. Olsen...

1230
02:15:35,403 --> 02:15:39,239
...is taking pictures of that dam,
but what I don't understand...

1231
02:15:39,407 --> 02:15:41,991
...is why you'd sell out
to a person you've never met.

1232
02:15:42,159 --> 02:15:44,411
I mean, you don't even
know his name. Oh, yeah.

1233
02:15:47,289 --> 02:15:50,083
At the stupid-high price he offered...

1234
02:15:50,251 --> 02:15:54,921
...for this worthless piece of desert,
I hope it's Custer.

1235
02:15:56,590 --> 02:15:59,259
Perfect. That's just what I need,
thank you.

1236
02:15:59,427 --> 02:16:03,805
Reporting live
from the launch site, ground zero.

1237
02:16:04,223 --> 02:16:07,267
Well, today marks an historic occasion.

1238
02:16:07,435 --> 02:16:12,605
Two XK 101 rockets
will be launched simultaneously...

1239
02:16:12,773 --> 02:16:15,442
...one by the Army and by the Navy.

1240
02:16:15,609 --> 02:16:17,944
Hi, everybody. Has anybody
seen Lois around today?

1241
02:16:18,112 --> 02:16:20,280
No, I haven't, but the chief
wants to see you.

1242
02:16:20,448 --> 02:16:22,866
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1243
02:16:23,033 --> 02:16:26,953
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today, okay?
Good? Great.

1244
02:16:27,121 --> 02:16:28,913
- Excuse me, Mr. White?
- Come in, Kent.

1245
02:16:29,081 --> 02:16:31,958
You wanted to see me?
Sir, have you seen Lois anywhere today?

1246
02:16:32,793 --> 02:16:35,128
She's out west looking into
a land fraud deal.

1247
02:16:35,337 --> 02:16:37,964
Sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1248
02:16:38,132 --> 02:16:41,301
Some unidentified clown out there
is buying up thousands of acres...

1249
02:16:41,469 --> 02:16:43,803
...of worthless desert
at incredible prices.

1250
02:16:43,971 --> 02:16:45,472
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1251
02:16:45,639 --> 02:16:48,558
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that by now.

1252
02:16:48,726 --> 02:16:50,977
Look at this dispatch
from Addis Ababa.

1253
02:16:51,145 --> 02:16:54,230
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people...

1254
02:16:54,398 --> 02:16:56,983
...and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.

1255
02:16:57,151 --> 02:16:58,777
- How do you figure that?
- Well...

1256
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:02,155
...frankly, I've never been able
to understand violence in any form.

1257
02:17:02,323 --> 02:17:06,451
I know that about you, Kent. That's one
of the reasons I wanted to talk to you.

1258
02:17:06,827 --> 02:17:10,163
I've been in this news game 40 years,
man and boy.

1259
02:17:10,372 --> 02:17:14,667
And I got where I am
with guts, compassion, elbow grease...

1260
02:17:14,835 --> 02:17:17,670
...and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1261
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:20,006
- Um, humility?
- No, not humility.

1262
02:17:20,174 --> 02:17:21,966
You got bags of humility.

1263
02:17:22,134 --> 02:17:24,511
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1264
02:17:24,678 --> 02:17:26,679
Take charge. Let people know
who you are.

1265
02:17:35,189 --> 02:17:37,357
This is Lex Luthor.

1266
02:17:37,525 --> 02:17:42,320
Only one thing alive with less than four legs
can hear this frequency, Superman: You.

1267
02:17:42,696 --> 02:17:45,114
In approximately five minutes,
a poison gas pellet...

1268
02:17:45,282 --> 02:17:47,992
...containing propane-lithium
compound...

1269
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:50,954
...will be released through
air ducts in the city...

1270
02:17:51,121 --> 02:17:54,374
...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.

1271
02:17:54,542 --> 02:17:58,002
I was a reporter before
most of my friends were copy boys.

1272
02:17:58,170 --> 02:18:01,005
I want you to do that.
Get Lois to introduce you to Superman.

1273
02:18:01,173 --> 02:18:04,384
Find out who he is. What's he like?
Where'd he get that blue suit?

1274
02:18:04,552 --> 02:18:07,720
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1275
02:18:07,888 --> 02:18:11,558
I know it all seems a bit much,
but how else was I going to meet you?

1276
02:18:11,725 --> 02:18:16,229
I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.

1277
02:18:16,897 --> 02:18:22,527
But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...

1278
02:18:22,695 --> 02:18:27,407
...well, I just knew you couldn't resist
the chance to sort of pitch in.

1279
02:18:27,575 --> 02:18:29,409
Know what I mean?

1280
02:18:47,011 --> 02:18:48,428
It's Superman.

1281
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:00,106
- Look.
- Oh, my God!

1282
02:19:02,276 --> 02:19:06,279
There's a strong streak of good
in you, Superman...

1283
02:19:06,614 --> 02:19:09,282
...but then, nobody's perfect.

1284
02:19:11,577 --> 02:19:13,578
Almost nobody.

1285
02:19:21,295 --> 02:19:23,129
- What the...?
- Oh, Superman.

1286
02:19:23,297 --> 02:19:25,548
- Gee.
- Stand back, please. Stand back.

1287
02:19:25,716 --> 02:19:27,467
Nothing to get worried about.

1288
02:19:33,307 --> 02:19:34,974
Well, don't just sit there. Get out.

1289
02:19:48,906 --> 02:19:52,158
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1290
02:19:52,326 --> 02:19:53,409
Tell me what you see.

1291
02:19:54,578 --> 02:19:56,788
Cuteness, dimples.

1292
02:19:57,164 --> 02:19:59,457
You like cuteness, huh?

1293
02:19:59,625 --> 02:20:01,167
Dimples.

1294
02:20:01,335 --> 02:20:03,294
I'll give you dimples.

1295
02:20:37,371 --> 02:20:41,040
The pressure is still on you, Superman.
You know what they say:

1296
02:20:41,208 --> 02:20:44,335
"If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the tunnel."

1297
02:21:07,401 --> 02:21:09,902
This is your last chance, Superman.

1298
02:21:10,237 --> 02:21:13,698
Why don't you do yourself
a flavor and freeze.

1299
02:21:37,097 --> 02:21:38,473
Yeah.

1300
02:21:55,783 --> 02:21:57,241
Hah.

1301
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,260
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1302
02:22:27,064 --> 02:22:29,357
He's definitely coming, Mr. Luthor.

1303
02:22:40,911 --> 02:22:42,745
It's open. Come in.

1304
02:22:44,748 --> 02:22:48,042
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1305
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:50,086
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1306
02:22:55,676 --> 02:22:59,262
- I don't think he wants me to.
- Luthor, where's the gas pellet?

1307
02:22:59,763 --> 02:23:01,180
Somewhere...

1308
02:23:02,933 --> 02:23:07,770
...in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1309
02:23:07,938 --> 02:23:12,233
Is that how your warped brain gets its
kicks? Planning the death of innocents?

1310
02:23:12,943 --> 02:23:16,112
No, by causing the death
of innocent people.

1311
02:23:22,202 --> 02:23:26,247
Seven, six,
five, four...

1312
02:23:26,415 --> 02:23:29,792
...three, two, one.

1313
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:31,502
Fire.

1314
02:23:33,505 --> 02:23:36,674
Navy Bird, we have a launch.

1315
02:23:36,842 --> 02:23:40,178
Navy missile, XK 101.

1316
02:23:40,345 --> 02:23:41,846
Angle of attack is perfect.

1317
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:46,184
- Climbing fast.
- Hydraulics, general function.

1318
02:23:46,351 --> 02:23:50,354
Now, as you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1319
02:23:50,564 --> 02:23:53,024
...very heavy into real estate.

1320
02:23:53,192 --> 02:23:57,612
To make money in that game, you have
to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1321
02:23:57,779 --> 02:24:00,031
- Right.
- Right.

1322
02:24:00,199 --> 02:24:03,034
So the problem:

1323
02:24:03,202 --> 02:24:06,037
How to make land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1324
02:24:06,205 --> 02:24:08,206
...and the time you sell it.

1325
02:24:08,582 --> 02:24:13,294
Now, this is California, the richest,
most populous state in the union.

1326
02:24:13,462 --> 02:24:16,547
I don't need a geography lesson
from you, Luthor.

1327
02:24:16,715 --> 02:24:20,968
Oh, yes, of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1328
02:24:21,136 --> 02:24:23,221
- Where was I?
- California.

1329
02:24:23,388 --> 02:24:26,974
California, right. The San Andreas Fault.
Maybe you've heard of it?

1330
02:24:27,142 --> 02:24:30,895
Yes. It's the joining of two land masses.
The fault line is unstable...

1331
02:24:31,063 --> 02:24:33,689
...which is why you get earthquakes
in California.

1332
02:24:33,857 --> 02:24:36,734
Wonderful.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1333
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:41,322
Everything west of this line
is the richest real estate in the world.

1334
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:44,158
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1335
02:24:44,326 --> 02:24:49,080
Everything on this side is just hundreds
of miles of worthless desert land...

1336
02:24:49,248 --> 02:24:50,998
...which happens to be owned by...

1337
02:24:52,376 --> 02:24:54,835
Lex Luthor, Incorporated.

1338
02:24:55,045 --> 02:24:59,423
Now, call me foolish,
call me irresponsible...

1339
02:24:59,591 --> 02:25:02,885
It occurs to me
that a 500-megaton bomb...

1340
02:25:03,053 --> 02:25:05,888
...planted at just the proper point,
would...

1341
02:25:06,056 --> 02:25:08,432
Would destroy most of California.

1342
02:25:09,559 --> 02:25:13,020
Millions of innocent people would die.
The West Coast as we know it would...

1343
02:25:13,188 --> 02:25:17,525
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1344
02:25:17,693 --> 02:25:20,903
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1345
02:25:23,282 --> 02:25:26,784
Costa del Lex, Luthorville,
Marina del Lex, Otisburg...

1346
02:25:29,705 --> 02:25:32,123
- Otisburg?
- Miss Teschmacher...

1347
02:25:32,291 --> 02:25:34,625
- ...she's got her own place, Mr...
- Otisburg?

1348
02:25:34,793 --> 02:25:37,795
- It's a little bitty place.
- Otisburg?

1349
02:25:37,963 --> 02:25:40,965
Okay. I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
It's a little town.

1350
02:25:41,133 --> 02:25:44,302
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A sick, twisted dreamer.

1351
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:46,804
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1352
02:25:46,972 --> 02:25:49,015
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1353
02:25:49,182 --> 02:25:52,059
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile...

1354
02:25:52,227 --> 02:25:55,938
...finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself.

1355
02:25:56,106 --> 02:25:59,817
Which, by the way, is target zero, right...

1356
02:26:00,402 --> 02:26:01,319
...here.

1357
02:26:01,778 --> 02:26:02,903
Ooh.

1358
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:23,090
Chief, listen. I promise you my friends and I
are gonna do all we can...

1359
02:26:23,258 --> 02:26:25,426
- ...to get to the bottom of this.
- Thank you, Miss Lane.

1360
02:26:25,594 --> 02:26:27,428
Okay, bye.

1361
02:26:58,168 --> 02:27:01,045
- What's happening, lieutenant?
- Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1362
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:06,050
- Then abort.
- Yes, sir.

1363
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:12,890
Function negative, sir.

1364
02:27:13,058 --> 02:27:15,893
- Can't you knock them down?
- Absolutely impossible, sir.

1365
02:27:16,061 --> 02:27:18,729
They have the new B-20 low-level
avoidance systems.

1366
02:27:18,897 --> 02:27:20,564
Get me the Pentagon.

1367
02:27:22,401 --> 02:27:24,068
Red line.

1368
02:27:25,028 --> 02:27:26,779
Hello? Hello!

1369
02:27:28,824 --> 02:27:33,202
That's impossible. Stand by.

1370
02:27:36,998 --> 02:27:40,918
Two hundred and eighty million dollars
and there's not a goddamned thing...

1371
02:27:41,086 --> 02:27:43,587
- ...we can do about it?
- That's right, senator.

1372
02:27:43,755 --> 02:27:45,923
You got what you paid for.

1373
02:27:46,091 --> 02:27:50,469
Can't happen here. Heh.
Can't happen here.

1374
02:27:50,637 --> 02:27:52,388
Get me the president.

1375
02:28:04,109 --> 02:28:05,526
Yeah?

1376
02:28:10,824 --> 02:28:12,908
Mr. President. Mr. President!

1377
02:28:13,076 --> 02:28:17,455
- Goddamn it, what is it now?
- The Pentagon's calling, sir.

1378
02:28:29,301 --> 02:28:32,887
Well, what do you think, Supe baby?
Interesting?

1379
02:28:33,054 --> 02:28:37,641
- Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
- Would you go to the viewing room?

1380
02:28:38,226 --> 02:28:41,228
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1381
02:28:41,396 --> 02:28:44,398
Fantasy? No. No.

1382
02:28:44,566 --> 02:28:47,568
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1383
02:28:47,736 --> 02:28:49,403
Miss Teschmacher!

1384
02:28:54,242 --> 02:28:57,328
- Yes, Lex?
- Where's the rocket now?

1385
02:28:57,496 --> 02:29:01,248
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon.
So is the other one.

1386
02:29:01,416 --> 02:29:04,418
The other one? There's two of them?

1387
02:29:06,922 --> 02:29:09,924
Yeah, Superman. Double jeopardy.

1388
02:29:10,091 --> 02:29:13,052
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1389
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:16,722
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1390
02:29:16,890 --> 02:29:20,434
All right, Luthor. Where is it?
Where's the detonator?

1391
02:29:34,282 --> 02:29:35,866
You diseased maniac.

1392
02:29:36,034 --> 02:29:39,245
Did you really think you could hide it
from me by encasing it in lead?

1393
02:29:41,289 --> 02:29:45,292
- I'll mold this box into your prison bars.
- Don't touch that.

1394
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:57,096
I told you. It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

1395
02:29:57,430 --> 02:30:00,599
I've spared no expense
to make you feel right at home.

1396
02:30:07,566 --> 02:30:12,111
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

1397
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:14,572
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1398
02:30:14,739 --> 02:30:18,409
...this old, diseased maniac...

1399
02:30:18,577 --> 02:30:20,744
...would be your banker.

1400
02:30:23,832 --> 02:30:26,041
Mind over muscle.

1401
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:38,137
You don't even care where
the other missile's headed, do you?

1402
02:30:38,346 --> 02:30:42,808
Certainly, I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.

1403
02:30:42,976 --> 02:30:44,643
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1404
02:30:50,483 --> 02:30:53,152
I have to leave you now.
No hard feelings.

1405
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:57,406
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.

1406
02:31:11,671 --> 02:31:15,674
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1407
02:31:25,518 --> 02:31:28,020
Miss Teschmacher!

1408
02:31:46,206 --> 02:31:47,873
Both birds uncontrolled.

1409
02:31:48,041 --> 02:31:49,041
Impossible to reset.

1410
02:31:55,507 --> 02:31:56,965
Otis.

1411
02:32:01,054 --> 02:32:02,346
Freeze.

1412
02:32:58,278 --> 02:33:00,279
Miss Teschmacher.

1413
02:33:00,447 --> 02:33:02,364
Miss Teschmacher.

1414
02:33:04,033 --> 02:33:06,618
Please, you can't...

1415
02:33:06,786 --> 02:33:08,036
You can't just stand there.

1416
02:33:08,288 --> 02:33:10,247
Shh.

1417
02:33:11,666 --> 02:33:13,167
You can't just stand there...

1418
02:33:13,334 --> 02:33:16,170
...and let innocent people,
millions of innocent people, die.

1419
02:33:17,172 --> 02:33:18,881
- Maybe.
- Please.

1420
02:33:19,716 --> 02:33:21,800
If it wasn't for my mother...

1421
02:33:23,553 --> 02:33:26,054
Please. Please help me to save them.

1422
02:33:28,099 --> 02:33:30,601
If I help you, do you promise
to save my mother first?

1423
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:33,896
But Lois and Jimmy...

1424
02:33:34,063 --> 02:33:35,439
Oh, but my mother comes first.

1425
02:33:35,607 --> 02:33:39,109
If you promise me, I'll believe you,
because you always tell the truth.

1426
02:33:41,446 --> 02:33:44,114
I promise. I promise.

1427
02:34:38,503 --> 02:34:41,046
Why did you kiss me first?

1428
02:34:42,173 --> 02:34:45,467
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

1429
02:34:46,469 --> 02:34:48,345
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1430
02:34:48,555 --> 02:34:52,641
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1431
02:34:57,564 --> 02:34:58,981
Stand aside now.

1432
02:34:59,148 --> 02:35:00,816
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1433
02:35:19,377 --> 02:35:21,044
Army bird still heading due east.

1434
02:35:21,212 --> 02:35:24,673
- Navy bird still heading due west.
- Losing radar contact.

1435
02:35:24,841 --> 02:35:26,884
Next radar contact in three seconds.

1436
02:35:27,051 --> 02:35:28,802
...intercept both birds.

1437
02:36:06,132 --> 02:36:08,258
Army bird still headed east, sir.

1438
02:36:13,097 --> 02:36:15,098
Someone's trying to destroy Metropolis.

1439
02:36:15,266 --> 02:36:18,644
Uh, actually sir, it looks like it's headed
for New Jersey.

1440
02:36:18,811 --> 02:36:21,813
Jersey? What the hell's in New Jersey?

1441
02:37:42,603 --> 02:37:44,938
- Army bird gaining altitude.
- Miss Teschmacher.

1442
02:37:45,106 --> 02:37:48,150
- Radar contact strong.
- We have straight climb.

1443
02:37:48,317 --> 02:37:50,318
Miss Teschmacher!

1444
02:37:50,486 --> 02:37:52,821
Radar report,
Navy bird, San Andreas area.

1445
02:37:52,989 --> 02:37:55,323
Heading down.
Fifteen seconds to impact.

1446
02:37:55,491 --> 02:37:57,993
Navy bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.

1447
02:37:58,494 --> 02:38:00,120
Fifteen seconds and counting.

1448
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:19,681
- Impact: San Andreas.
- God!

1449
02:39:16,531 --> 02:39:18,406
We interrupt the program
for a news flash.

1450
02:39:18,574 --> 02:39:21,910
A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.

1451
02:39:22,078 --> 02:39:25,455
The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas Fault.

1452
02:39:25,623 --> 02:39:28,291
California is suffering
a major earthquake.

1453
02:41:01,886 --> 02:41:03,428
What the...?

1454
02:41:17,401 --> 02:41:19,277
What's going on?

1455
02:41:21,072 --> 02:41:22,155
It's a quake. Look!

1456
02:41:38,256 --> 02:41:39,506
Look out!

1457
02:41:50,393 --> 02:41:52,060
Get to the back of the bus!

1458
02:42:54,707 --> 02:42:56,166
Okay, kids. It's all right now.

1459
02:42:56,334 --> 02:42:58,001
Thank God, we're back on the bridge.

1460
02:42:58,169 --> 02:43:00,587
- Hey, it's Superman.
- It's Superman!

1461
02:43:09,013 --> 02:43:11,139
Holy mackerel!

1462
02:43:12,058 --> 02:43:13,183
Going off the tracks!

1463
02:43:15,811 --> 02:43:17,187
Hang on!

1464
02:43:22,735 --> 02:43:23,860
I can't hold her!

1465
02:44:12,701 --> 02:44:14,452
All personnel, evacuate now.

1466
02:44:15,996 --> 02:44:18,081
All personnel, evacuate now.

1467
02:44:21,877 --> 02:44:23,628
Watch that cable!

1468
02:44:23,796 --> 02:44:25,338
My eyes! I can't see!

1469
02:44:34,223 --> 02:44:36,808
Execute earthquake procedure.

1470
02:44:36,976 --> 02:44:40,061
- Execute earthquake procedure.
- Get out! Get out, get out!

1471
02:44:42,857 --> 02:44:44,566
Someone try and pull the main!

1472
02:44:44,733 --> 02:44:46,943
It's impossible, it's red-hot!

1473
02:44:55,411 --> 02:44:57,787
- Gentlemen, is that man all right?
- Yeah.

1474
02:44:58,664 --> 02:45:02,208
Gee, that's Superman.
He must've been the one that saved us.

1475
02:45:28,986 --> 02:45:31,821
- Ah...!
- Hang on, kid.

1476
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:39,287
Go ahead, shoot.

1477
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:55,845
The dam burst!

1478
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:59,307
Forget the car! Come on, come on!

1479
02:46:03,521 --> 02:46:05,522
You're safe here, son.

1480
02:46:06,690 --> 02:46:08,858
That's okay!
Miss Lane will be driving by soon.

1481
02:46:18,702 --> 02:46:20,703
- Come on, George.
- Make for the hill.

1482
02:46:37,096 --> 02:46:39,180
There has been major quake damage...

1483
02:46:39,348 --> 02:46:40,390
...to Southern California.

1484
02:46:40,558 --> 02:46:43,101
The San Andreas Fault
has miraculously sealed itself...

1485
02:46:43,269 --> 02:46:46,521
...yet Southern California is suffering
major aftershocks of a major earthquake.

1486
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:49,941
The population is warned
to be aware of...

1487
02:47:15,551 --> 02:47:16,801
Please, come on, turn over.

1488
02:47:16,969 --> 02:47:18,886
- Which in some areas has...
- Come on!

1489
02:47:46,498 --> 02:47:48,333
Help me. Help me.

1490
02:47:49,752 --> 02:47:50,960
No.

1491
02:50:11,226 --> 02:50:12,351
Water!

1492
02:51:01,902 --> 02:51:02,985
Lois.

1493
02:53:58,912 --> 02:54:01,914
No, no, no.

1494
02:54:02,916 --> 02:54:05,751
No. No.

1495
02:54:18,598 --> 02:54:20,558
My son.

1496
02:54:20,767 --> 02:54:23,769
It is forbidden for you to interfere
in human history.

1497
02:54:23,937 --> 02:54:29,191
One thing I do know, son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

1498
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:32,445
- It is forbidden for you to interfere...
- Those things I can do...

1499
02:54:32,612 --> 02:54:35,948
...all those powers,
and I couldn't even save him.

1500
02:54:36,116 --> 02:54:37,783
It is forbidden.

1501
02:54:40,203 --> 02:54:42,413
It is forbidden.

1502
02:54:46,418 --> 02:54:50,129
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

1503
02:54:50,297 --> 02:54:52,214
It is forbidden.

1504
02:56:07,374 --> 02:56:08,833
Hi.

1505
02:56:10,210 --> 02:56:11,669
Don't bother, I think it's dead.

1506
02:56:13,547 --> 02:56:15,631
Sure it's dead.

1507
02:56:16,758 --> 02:56:20,177
The problem with men of steel, there's
never one around when you want one.

1508
02:56:20,345 --> 02:56:22,680
Know what happened to me
while you were off flying?

1509
02:56:22,848 --> 02:56:24,390
I was almost in an earthquake...

1510
02:56:24,558 --> 02:56:26,559
...I had this gas station blow up...

1511
02:56:26,726 --> 02:56:29,061
...there's telephone poles
falling all over...

1512
02:56:29,271 --> 02:56:32,064
...I'm almost killed,
and to top the whole thing off...

1513
02:56:32,232 --> 02:56:33,858
...this stupid car runs out of gas!

1514
02:56:34,025 --> 02:56:35,901
I'm sorry about that, Lois...

1515
02:56:36,069 --> 02:56:38,237
...but I've been kind of busy
for a while.

1516
02:56:40,824 --> 02:56:43,284
I'm sorry. That's all right.

1517
02:56:44,369 --> 02:56:46,620
We're sort of alike, aren't we?

1518
02:56:46,830 --> 02:56:49,623
I mean, our work comes first.

1519
02:57:02,679 --> 02:57:04,221
Hey!

1520
02:57:04,764 --> 02:57:06,056
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1521
02:57:06,433 --> 02:57:09,059
You put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1522
02:57:09,227 --> 02:57:11,270
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.

1523
02:57:11,438 --> 02:57:13,106
I had no idea if you were coming back...

1524
02:57:13,330 --> 02:57:14,106
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

1525
02:57:15,483 --> 02:57:18,777
Listen, there's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1526
02:57:21,114 --> 02:57:23,574
He can't stay still for a second.

1527
02:57:25,368 --> 02:57:27,828
You could at least send for a tow truck!

1528
02:57:27,996 --> 02:57:32,249
Oh. Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent didn't see all this.

1529
02:57:32,417 --> 02:57:34,001
Yeah, poor Clark.

1530
02:57:34,169 --> 02:57:36,170
He's never around when S...

1531
02:57:36,546 --> 02:57:37,922
Clark... Wait a minute.

1532
02:57:38,089 --> 02:57:39,882
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1533
02:57:41,426 --> 02:57:43,677
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea ever.

1534
02:57:43,845 --> 02:57:47,598
Let me tell you something, Miss Lane,
I think he really cares about you.

1535
02:57:47,766 --> 02:57:49,850
- Clark? Of course he does.
- No, not Clark.

1536
02:57:53,271 --> 02:57:57,858
Oh, well, Superman cares
about everybody, Jimmy.

1537
02:57:58,276 --> 02:58:02,613
But, who knows, someday,
maybe, if he's lucky...

1538
02:58:04,532 --> 02:58:05,699
- Miss Lane?
- Hm?

1539
02:58:07,327 --> 02:58:10,037
Jimmy, my hair!

1540
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:11,747
Now.

1541
02:58:12,415 --> 02:58:14,792
Ooh, nice. Nice, nice.

1542
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:17,044
Front page, Daily Planet?

1543
02:58:18,505 --> 02:58:21,173
Oh, gosh. I didn't have any film.

1545

1552
02:59:14,477 --> 02:59:17,062
But Lex, you can't do this to me.

1553
02:59:17,230 --> 02:59:19,273
Why, Lex, why?

1554
02:59:19,774 --> 02:59:22,776
Because I love you, Miss Teschmacher.

1555
02:59:26,364 --> 02:59:27,531
Miss Teschmacher...

1556
02:59:38,710 --> 02:59:41,879
By the way Miss Teschmacher,
your mother sends her love.

1557
02:59:53,141 --> 02:59:54,767
You're messing up my suit.

1558
02:59:54,934 --> 02:59:56,685
You big lummox, you.

1559
02:59:56,853 --> 02:59:58,937
Come on, stop it, will you.

1560
02:59:59,105 --> 03:00:01,690
Otis, it's your fault.
Watch the ground!

1561
03:00:02,442 --> 03:00:03,776
Good evening, warden.

1562
03:00:03,943 --> 03:00:05,694
These two men should be safe here...

1563
03:00:05,904 --> 03:00:08,280
- ...until they can get a fair trial.
- Who is it?

1564
03:00:10,700 --> 03:00:12,284
Lex Luthor!

1565
03:00:12,452 --> 03:00:15,204
- The greatest criminal mind of our time!
- Of our time!

1566
03:00:15,372 --> 03:00:16,955
- I hereby serve notice...
- Notice.

1567
03:00:17,123 --> 03:00:18,874
- ...that these walls...
- These walls here...

1568
03:00:19,042 --> 03:00:20,209
Will you shut up, please.

1569
03:00:20,377 --> 03:00:21,877
All right, take them away, boys.

1570
03:00:22,045 --> 03:00:24,463
- You nitwit. Nincompoop!
- Guard, guard...

1571
03:00:24,631 --> 03:00:28,717
This country is safe again, Superman,
thanks to you.

1572
03:00:28,885 --> 03:00:30,928
No, sir. Don't thank me, warden.

1573
03:00:31,554 --> 03:00:33,722
We're all part of the same team.

1574
03:00:33,932 --> 03:00:35,432
Night.
