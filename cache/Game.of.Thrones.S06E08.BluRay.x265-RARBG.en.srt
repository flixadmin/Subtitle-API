Lesson number one,
assume everyone wants to hit you.

214

I just assumed Sansa was dead.

Why would you assume that?

220

In my experience,
girls like her don't live very long.

I don't think you know many girls like her.

Well, I'm proud of you.

223

I am. You fulfilled your oath
to Catelyn Stark against all odds.

224
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,885
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

225

The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

226

Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral
seat back from the Boltons

231
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,406
and assume her rightful position
as Lady of Winterfell.

232
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,368
With what army
does she plan on taking Winterfell?

233
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,869
The Tully army.

234
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,788
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

235
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,208
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

236
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,168
so you can see the conundrum.

237
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,480
The Tullys are rebels
because they're fighting for their home?

238
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,631
Riverrun was granted to the Freys
by royal decree.

239
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,385
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark
and slaughtering his family.

00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,886
Exactly.

- I'm a Lannister.

Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

248

Ride south again with your mission complete
and your army intact.

00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,331
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

251
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,043
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish
to give up the castle.

252
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,254
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

253
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,674
Because you'll allow him
to lead the Tully forces safely north.

Of course it does.

To fight you.

I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

you're a bloody fool.

Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters
and the Freys.

with the gold lion on the pommel?

Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

298

He gave me this sword to protect her.

00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,846
Your place is in the gallery

324
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,473
with the other ladies of the court.

325
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,774
PYCELLE: Your Grace...

326
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,253
Lords and ladies,

327
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:45,175
the Faith and the Crown
are the two pillars that hold up this world.

328
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,679
One collapses, so does the other.

329
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,142
The Father judges us all.

330
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,602
If you break his laws,

331
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,565
you will be punished.

332
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,279
After conferring with
His Holiness the High Septon,

333
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:10,575
we have determined that Loras Tyrell
and Cersei Lannister's trial

334
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,913
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor
on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

335
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,331
<i>(INDISTINCT MURMURS)</i>

336
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,632
Furthermore, after much prayer
and reflection,

337
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,095
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

338
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,348
trial by combat will be forbidden
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

339
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,520
The tradition is a brutish one,

340
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,522
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers

341
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,233
in order to avoid true judgment
from the gods.

342
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:47,821
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell
will stand trial before seven septons

343
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,781
as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

344
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,034
Seven blessings to all.

345
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,869
CROWD: Seven blessings.

346
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,421
<i>(DOOR OPENING)</i>

347
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,518
Your Grace.

348
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,981
That old rumor you told me about.

349
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,277
My little birds investigated.

350
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,613
And?

351
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,118
Was it just a rumor or something more?

352
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,953
More.

353
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,707
Much more.

354
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,590
MISSANDEI: You seem happy.

355
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,800
I am happy.

356
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,137
You should both be happy as well.

357
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,932
Not so long ago,
this city was ready to devour itself.

358
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,144
Now it's like a man reborn.

359
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,313
I will be happy when our queen returns.

360
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,941
Why don't you drink?
Why don't either of you ever drink?

361
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,234
Unsullied never drink.

362
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,402
- Why not?
- Rules.

363
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,988
And who made these rules?

364
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,156
Your former masters?

365
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,327
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.

366
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,996
Have a drink with me.

367
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,668
And you? What's your excuse?

368
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,173
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.

369
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,800
That's how you know it's working.

370
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,012
Here's to our queen.

371
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,891
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

372
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:47,315
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains,

373
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,942
long may she reign.

374
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,111
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

375
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,451
TYRION: Do you like it?

376
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,578
GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.

377
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,873
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

378
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,756
One day, after our queen has taken
the Seven Kingdoms,

379
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,635
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

380
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,222
Make my own wine.

381
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,933
The Imp's Delight.

382
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,145
Only my close friends could drink it.

383
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,382
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

384
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,236
I do not know any jokes.

385
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
Grey Worm?

386
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,908
Right.

387
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,414
Three lords walk into a tavern.

388
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,457
A Stark, a Martell and a Lannister.

389
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,626
They order ale,

390
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,379
but when the barkeep brings them over,

391
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,923
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

392
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,428
The Lannister, outraged,
shoves the cup aside and demands another.

393
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,348
The Martell plucks the fly out
and swallows it whole.

394
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,436
The Stark reaches into his cup,

395
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,772
pulls out the fly and shouts,

396
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,110
"Spit it out, you wee shit. Spit it out."

397
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,535
It's funnier in Westeros.

398
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,622
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

399
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,831
Yes.

400
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,667
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

401
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,670
Not a true story, necessarily.

402
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,298
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

403
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,967
Not at the moment, perhaps.

404
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,220
Missandei, do you like the wine?

405
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,804
I do.

406
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,139
Tell a joke.

407
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,065
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

408
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,818
The first says,

409
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,654
"Do you know how to swim?"

410
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,659
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

411
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,664
Ah! <i>(LAUGHS)</i>

412
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,128
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

413
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,856
MISSANDEI:
You don't even know what a joke is.

414
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,800
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

415
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,177
You lied to us.

416
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,180
I make joke.

I once walked into a brothel

I apologize for the way

A good death is all he can hope for.

But you, you have a child now, I've heard.

You're a potent man.

443

A son I've never met

born of a wife that I haven't seen
since our first night together.

You should be with them both.

I can arrange that, you realize?

447

Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.

448
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,461
A tutor for your boy,
knights to train him to fight and to ride.

449
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,963
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

Kept me in a cell for years.

454
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,061
Stolen our lands.

I'll remind you that our houses are at war.

I admired her.

00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,083
Cold winds are rising in the North.

644
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,085
And you're going to go stop them?

645
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,129
We need good men to help us.

646
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,800
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

647
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,387
BERIC: True enough.

648
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,306
But the Lord of Light
gave you the power to defeat me.

649
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:12,349
Why?

650
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,809
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

651
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,437
I beat you
because I'm better than you, Beric.

652
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:21,608
I was better than you before you started
yammering on about the Lord,

653
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,403
and I'm better than you now.

654
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,279
Aye, you're probably right.

655
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,157
You're a fighter.

656
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,785
You were born a fighter.

657
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:34,413
You walked away from the fight.

658
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:35,705
How did that go?

659
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:42,295
Good and bad, young and old,

660
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,631
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

661
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,803
You can still help
a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.

662
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,347
It's not too late for you.

Lady Crane?

Instead...

670
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,358
The Many-Faced God was promised a name.

671

He must always receive what is his.

You can't change that.
