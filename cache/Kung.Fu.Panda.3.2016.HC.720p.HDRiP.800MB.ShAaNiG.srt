1
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:52,755
<font color="#ffff00">Stairs!</font>

2
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:54,953
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think I can...</font>

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,757
<font color="#ffff00">Hey guys... just start without me.</font>

4
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:01,665
<font color="#ffff00">I'll catch up.</font>

5
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:12,921
<font color="#ffff00">Sweet!</font>

6
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:37,268
<font color="#ffff00">Inner Peace. Inner Peace.</font>

7
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,188
<font color="#ffff00">Itchy nose.</font>

8
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:50,564
<font color="#ffff00">Finally, Inner Peace.</font>

9
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:52,704
<font color="#ffff00">Now what?</font>

10
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,209
<font color="#ffff00">"Kai" old friend!</font>

11
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,132
<font color="#ffff00">Master Oogway.</font>

12
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:14,579
<font color="#ffff00">Ah! Our battle ended
five hundred years ago.</font>

13
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,125
<font color="#ffff00">Well, now I am ready for a rematch.</font>

14
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:19,259
<font color="#ffff00">Took you long enough.</font>

15
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,789
<font color="#ffff00">You've grown stronger.</font>

16
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,289
<font color="#ffff00">500 years in the spirit realm,
you'll pick up a thing or two.</font>

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,592
<font color="#ffff00">I have taken the Chi of every master here.</font>

18
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,704
<font color="#ffff00">No.
- Yes.</font>

19
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,721
<font color="#ffff00">And soon I'll have your power, too.</font>

20
00:02:57,062 --> 00:03:01,380
<font color="#ffff00">When will you realize,
"The more you take, the less you have"?</font>

21
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:26,702
<font color="#ffff00">With your Chi, I'll finally be able
to return to the mortal world.</font>

22
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:31,228
<font color="#ffff00">And this time, you won't
be there to stop me.</font>

23
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,455
<font color="#ffff00">It was never my destiny to stop you.
I have set another on that path.</font>

24
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:48,216
<font color="#ffff00">Then I will find him and take his Chi too.</font>

25
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,736
<font color="#ffff00">Justice...is about to be served.</font>

26
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,980
<font color="#ffff00">We'll have two Justice Platters, please.</font>

27
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,020
<font color="#ffff00">- Umm... three.
- And a few tofu bun.</font>

28
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,631
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that?</font>

29
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:11,841
<font color="#ffff00">She wants it on the side.</font>

30
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,070
<font color="#ffff00">On the side.
- On the side.</font>

31
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,450
<font color="#ffff00">Dragon you can do it.</font>

32
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,490
<font color="#ffff00">Go Dragon Warrior.
- Defend the valley.</font>

33
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,990
<font color="#ffff00">Go Dragon Warrior.
- Yeah defend the valley.</font>

34
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,300
<font color="#ffff00">You guys aren't doing the
dramatic pose, are you?</font>

35
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,900
<font color="#ffff00">Do we have to strike the
pose every time we land?</font>

36
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,190
<font color="#ffff00">You guys never underestimate
the power of a dramatic entrance.</font>

37
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,710
<font color="#ffff00">I've heard about some masters who could win
a fight just by throwing open a door.</font>

38
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,869
<font color="#ffff00">Dramatic entrance?</font>

39
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
<font color="#ffff00">Master Shifu.</font>

40
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,850
<font color="#ffff00">The Dragon Warrior is great.</font>

41
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,480
<font color="#ffff00">Really? I was just making...
yeah I mean yeah I am.</font>

42
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,800
<font color="#ffff00">Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.</font>

43
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,780
<font color="#ffff00">Hence, the dramatic entrance.</font>

44
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,790
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, nice dramatic entrance.</font>

45
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,520
<font color="#ffff00">- What's the occasion?
- Today will be my final class.</font>

46
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,990
<font color="#ffff00">Your final...? wait
I didn't even know you were sick.</font>

47
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,120
<font color="#ffff00">Although you have been looking a little...
- I'm not sick.</font>

48
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,580
<font color="#ffff00">Healthy. A little healthy.
A lot actually.</font>

49
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,060
<font color="#ffff00">My final class because from now on...</font>

50
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,770
<font color="#ffff00">your training will be in the
hands of the Dragon Warrior.</font>

51
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,500
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

52
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,400
<font color="#ffff00">Me? Teach? I mean why not Tigress?
She's always telling everyone what to do.</font>

53
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,430
<font color="#ffff00">Be quiet Po.
- See what I mean?</font>

54
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,700
<font color="#ffff00">Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.
You are.</font>

55
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,120
<font color="#ffff00">Come on they're the five.
What can I teach them?</font>

56
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,150
<font color="#ffff00">There is always something more to learn.
Even for a master.</font>

57
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,180
<font color="#ffff00">For instance, let me show you another move.</font>

58
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,150
<font color="#ffff00">The dramatic exit.</font>

59
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,030
<font color="#ffff00">What's that?</font>

60
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,660
<font color="#ffff00">Are you kidding me? That... what?</font>

61
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,760
<font color="#ffff00">- Where'd he go?
- Master.</font>

62
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,100
<font color="#ffff00">He's gone guys. It's cool.
- We are await your instruction master.</font>

63
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,440
<font color="#ffff00">All you have to lose is our respect.</font>

64
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,979
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously how bad could it be?</font>

65
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,101
<font color="#ffff00">Leave me...</font>

66
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,189
<font color="#ffff00">OK OK let's switch it up.
Monkey, immovable mountain stance.</font>

67
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,190
<font color="#ffff00">Yes Master.</font>

68
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,420
<font color="#ffff00">I mean... Tigress tornado back flip.
- Yes, master.</font>

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
<font color="#ffff00">Oh no fire.
- Fire.</font>

70
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,860
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, my fault
Crane go high, I mean low.</font>

71
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,125
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my claw thingy - Viper and
tigress, to... like a totem pole.</font>

72
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,249
<font color="#ffff00">Poison, Technique.</font>

73
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,320
<font color="#ffff00">You two, to... sworming insect bite
with yellow tail, yellow jacket...</font>

74
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,570
<font color="#ffff00">Spicy... tuna.</font>

75
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,120
<font color="#ffff00">Good job, Po.</font>

76
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,740
<font color="#ffff00">Did you at least learn a little something?
- Yes, that you can't teach.</font>

77
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,630
<font color="#ffff00">And tigress is flammable turns out.</font>

78
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,120
<font color="#ffff00">That was a complete disaster.</font>

79
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,390
<font color="#ffff00">I'm glad we're not Po right now.
- What a loser.</font>

80
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,970
<font color="#ffff00">What was Shifu thinking?
- What was Oogway thinking?</font>

81
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,770
<font color="#ffff00">I think he heard us.
- I didn't hear anything.</font>

82
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,980
<font color="#ffff00">He said you're a loser.</font>

83
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,720
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry Oogway.</font>

84
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,630
<font color="#ffff00">Would you stop doing that?
- How was your first day teaching?</font>

85
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,930
<font color="#ffff00">Humiliating.
- I heard.</font>

86
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,650
<font color="#ffff00">Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?</font>

87
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,227
<font color="#ffff00">I heard from Monkey and
Crane and Mantis and</font>

88
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,580
<font color="#ffff00">your dad and Mrs. Chau
from the gift shop.</font>

89
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,300
<font color="#ffff00">And those ducks who just passed
and Tigress told me.</font>

90
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,610
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, well did she also tell you that
it'll never happen again cause I'm done?</font>

91
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,750
<font color="#ffff00">Teaching, or being humiliated?</font>

92
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,780
<font color="#ffff00">Both. I don't know why you ever thought
I could teach that class?</font>

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,290
<font color="#ffff00">Oh I knew you couldn't.
- What?</font>

94
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
<font color="#ffff00">You set me up to fail? Why?</font>

95
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,580
<font color="#ffff00">If you only do what you can do
you'll never be more than you are now.</font>

96
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,530
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wanna be more
I like who I am.</font>

97
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,300
<font color="#ffff00">You don't even know who you are.</font>

98
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,620
<font color="#ffff00">What do you...? Of course I do
I'm the Dragon Warrior.</font>

99
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,460
<font color="#ffff00">And what exactly does
that mean Dragon Warrior?</font>

100
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,670
<font color="#ffff00">It means... you know... just going around
and punching and kicking.</font>

101
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,200
<font color="#ffff00">Defending the valley and stuff.</font>

102
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,080
<font color="#ffff00">Punching and kicking?</font>

103
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,110
<font color="#ffff00">You think that is what the great
master Oogway saw for you?</font>

104
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,810
<font color="#ffff00">A five hundred year prophecy full-filled so
you can spend your days...</font>

105
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,079
<font color="#ffff00">Kicking butt? And running through
town high-fiving bunnies?</font>

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.
- No.</font>

107
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,700
<font color="#ffff00">Oogway saw greatness in you Po
against my better judgment.</font>

108
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,560
<font color="#ffff00">More than you can see in yourself.</font>

109
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,110
<font color="#ffff00">Incredible power awaits you.</font>

110
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,280
<font color="#ffff00">Power beyond anything you can imagine.</font>

111
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,160
<font color="#ffff00">What was that?
- That was chi.</font>

112
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,860
<font color="#ffff00">What's chi?</font>

113
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,510
<font color="#ffff00">The energy that flows
through all living things.</font>

114
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,474
<font color="#ffff00">So you're saying if I,
so you're saying if I</font>

115
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,370
<font color="#ffff00">teach, I'll be able to
do cool stuff like that?</font>

116
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,650
<font color="#ffff00">No I'm saying if you teach, I'll be
able to do cool stuff like that.</font>

117
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,260
<font color="#ffff00">Mastery of chi requires mastery of self.</font>

118
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,130
<font color="#ffff00">Oogway sat alone in a cave for
thirty years asking one question...</font>

119
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,890
<font color="#ffff00">Who am I?</font>

120
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,770
<font color="#ffff00">Who am I?</font>

121
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,660
<font color="#ffff00">I'm lucky if I get five
minutes before you interrupt.</font>

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,680
<font color="#ffff00">So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for thirty years?</font>

123
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,690
<font color="#ffff00">Eventually.
After you master teaching.</font>

124
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,820
<font color="#ffff00">Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.</font>

125
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,070
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not trying to turn you into me.</font>

126
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,870
<font color="#ffff00">I'm trying to turn you into you.</font>

127
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,410
<font color="#ffff00">Turn me into me?
Wait a second. That makes no...(sense)</font>

128
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,630
<font color="#ffff00">Almost there shifu, just a little more
confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.</font>

129
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,300
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, no offense master Oogway
I just...</font>

130
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,750
<font color="#ffff00">I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.</font>

131
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,280
<font color="#ffff00">What is this place?
- Aaah... my brother's farm.</font>

132
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,920
<font color="#ffff00">If I stepped on you, would you die?</font>

133
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,720
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

134
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,880
<font color="#ffff00">The mortal realm.</font>

135
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,920
<font color="#ffff00">You hear that Oogway?
I'm back.</font>

136
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,180
<font color="#ffff00">Kai has returned.</font>

137
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,930
<font color="#ffff00">Who?
- Kai. General Kai.</font>

138
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,390
<font color="#ffff00">Supreme warlord of all China.</font>

139
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,270
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.
- The jade slayer, master of pain.</font>

140
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,460
<font color="#ffff00">You may know me as the beast of vengeance.</font>

141
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,510
<font color="#ffff00">Maker of widows?</font>

142
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,930
<font color="#ffff00">OK I used to work with Oogway.</font>

143
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,360
<font color="#ffff00">Oh master Oogway, he was a great warrior.
We've heard of master oogway... Wise and...</font>

144
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,930
<font color="#ffff00">OK... Silence.</font>

145
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,360
<font color="#ffff00">Find Oogway's students
and bring them to me.</font>

146
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,950
<font color="#ffff00">By the time I am done with them Oogway...</font>

147
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,610
<font color="#ffff00">There will be no one left who
will even remember your name.</font>

148
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,570
<font color="#ffff00">Kai is coming.</font>

149
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,390
<font color="#ffff00">I am ready...</font>

150
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,570
<font color="#ffff00">to teach you a lesson.
- Teach me?</font>

151
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,910
<font color="#ffff00">Oh no he's the Dragon teacher.
- Yeah he's so handsome.</font>

152
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,940
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for the compliment.</font>

153
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,209
<font color="#ffff00">No, please don't teach me to death.</font>

154
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,300
<font color="#ffff00">Po?</font>

155
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,080
<font color="#ffff00">Oh hey dad What's up?</font>

156
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,440
<font color="#ffff00">I like just ...stopping
by for a little soak.</font>

157
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,340
<font color="#ffff00">OK, What's wrong?
- Nothing.</font>

158
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,010
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing? I come home and find you
taking a bath with your dolls.</font>

159
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,170
<font color="#ffff00">Action figures. - And instead of
adding bath-salt to the water...</font>

160
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,580
<font color="#ffff00">You just added Szechuan peppercorns.
- Szechuan what?</font>

161
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,190
<font color="#ffff00">My tenders.</font>

162
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,620
<font color="#ffff00">OK yes, something's wrong - There there
son, you tell your daddy all about it.</font>

163
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,210
<font color="#ffff00">Lift your arm.</font>

164
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,320
<font color="#ffff00">Shifu says I don't know what it
means to be the Dragon Warrior.</font>

165
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,370
<font color="#ffff00">And now I have to be a teacher.</font>

166
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,350
<font color="#ffff00">I thought I finally knew who I was. If I'm
not the Dragon Warrior, then who am I?</font>

167
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,790
<font color="#ffff00">A teacher? Teaching kung fu?</font>

168
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,110
<font color="#ffff00">That's a promotion. Take the job, son.</font>

169
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,269
<font color="#ffff00">And someday, when you're
in charge of the whole.</font>

170
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,170
<font color="#ffff00">Jade palace, I can sell
noodles in the lobby.</font>

171
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,010
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you still here taking a bath like
a baby? Get out. Get out. Go, go, go.</font>

172
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,691
<font color="#ffff00">Franchise expansion awaits us.</font>

173
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,040
<font color="#ffff00">What about the Dragon Warrior
look alike contest?</font>

174
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,950
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs. Chau always wins that.
- Skadoosh.</font>

175
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,350
<font color="#ffff00">And the Dragon Warrior
dumpling eating contest?</font>

176
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,700
<font color="#ffff00">I have to defend my title.</font>

177
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,320
<font color="#ffff00">No one's gonna beat your
dumpling eating record.</font>

178
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,940
<font color="#ffff00">Someone's about to beat your
dumpling eating record.</font>

179
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,679
<font color="#ffff00">Go. Go. Go.</font>

180
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,970
<font color="#ffff00">Who's eating my dumplings?
- And who's paying for them?</font>

181
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,170
<font color="#ffff00">101, 102.</font>

182
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,970
<font color="#ffff00">Li: 103.</font>

183
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,380
<font color="#ffff00">Is that a new record?</font>

184
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,329
<font color="#ffff00">Who are you?</font>

185
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,330
<font color="#ffff00">I'm Li Shan.
- What?</font>

186
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,890
<font color="#ffff00">I'm Li shan.</font>

187
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,380
<font color="#ffff00">I'm looking for my son.</font>

188
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,150
<font color="#ffff00">You lost your son?
- Yes, many years ago.</font>

189
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,200
<font color="#ffff00">I lost my father.
- Very sorry.</font>

190
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,120
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

191
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,950
<font color="#ffff00">Well, good luck to you.
- You too.</font>

192
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,210
<font color="#ffff00">I hope you find your son.</font>

193
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,630
<font color="#ffff00">And I hope you find your father.</font>

194
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,550
<font color="#ffff00">Son? Oh my gosh, it is you.</font>

195
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,130
<font color="#ffff00">Well don't just stand there
give your old man a hug.</font>

196
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,780
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe you're alive.</font>

197
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,130
<font color="#ffff00">I thought I'd lost you forever
little Lotus.</font>

198
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,990
<font color="#ffff00">This is very embarrassing, but
I think you've got me confused</font>

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,580
<font color="#ffff00">with a panda named Lotus.
My name is Po.</font>

200
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,640
<font color="#ffff00">Oh right, you wouldn't... OK.</font>

201
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,060
<font color="#ffff00">See, the little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.</font>

202
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,540
<font color="#ffff00">Really?
- Really.</font>

203
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,000
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe it. After all these
years and you're really here?</font>

204
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,220
<font color="#ffff00">This is amazing.</font>

205
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,320
<font color="#ffff00">Oh dad. Come say hi to...</font>

206
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,310
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.</font>

207
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,310
<font color="#ffff00">I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li.</font>

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,770
<font color="#ffff00">You... come here.</font>

209
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,890
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, thank you for taking
such good care of my son.</font>

210
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,960
<font color="#ffff00">Your son?
Now hold on just a minute.</font>

211
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,961
<font color="#ffff00">How do we know this stranger is
even related to you?</font>

212
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,030
<font color="#ffff00">Look at that.
Our bellies could be brothers.</font>

213
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,770
<font color="#ffff00">Hey son, let me teach you how to
belly gong. All right, belly gong.</font>

214
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
<font color="#ffff00">It's like looking in a fat mirror.</font>

215
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,210
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe we're
taking a picture together.</font>

216
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,100
<font color="#ffff00">But I still don't understand.
I thought Po was the only panda left.</font>

217
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,710
<font color="#ffff00">No, there's a whole bunch of us.
- Where?</font>

218
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,290
<font color="#ffff00">Here, a secret panda village in the
mountains - A secret panda...</font>

219
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,560
<font color="#ffff00">But how did you know where I was?
- I received a message that led me here.</font>

220
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,760
<font color="#ffff00">How could you receive a message
if no one could find you?</font>

221
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,050
<font color="#ffff00">Sounds suspicious to me.</font>

222
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,290
<font color="#ffff00">No, wait wait.
It was a message from the universe.</font>

223
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,180
<font color="#ffff00">Rats.</font>

224
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,370
<font color="#ffff00">Now what's all this about a Dragon Warrior?</font>

225
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,430
<font color="#ffff00">How'd you know I was the Dragon Warrior?
Did the universe tell you that, too?</font>

226
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,890
<font color="#ffff00">No, the poster did and the gift shop
I bought a tiny cup.</font>

227
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,440
<font color="#ffff00">Oh right, of course...</font>

228
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,300
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta... you have no idea there's
so much to show you.</font>

229
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,151
<font color="#ffff00">You're gonna be so awesomely proud.</font>

230
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,910
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, come on.</font>

231
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,150
<font color="#ffff00">I'm already awesomely proud.</font>

232
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,580
<font color="#ffff00">Couple more steps.
- Oh.</font>

233
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,100
<font color="#ffff00">Feeling the burn.</font>

234
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,450
<font color="#ffff00">Do you have panda asthma, too?
Does that run in the family?</font>

235
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,290
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, you're gonna love this.</font>

236
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,190
<font color="#ffff00">It's like the coolest thing ever.</font>

237
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,980
<font color="#ffff00">This is the hall of heroes.</font>

238
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,100
<font color="#ffff00">Home of the most priceless
kung fu artifacts in all of China.</font>

239
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,920
<font color="#ffff00">This place is...
Awesome?</font>

240
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,121
<font color="#ffff00">You were going to say awesome, right?</font>

241
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,990
<font color="#ffff00">Because it totally is.
- Totally.</font>

242
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,310
<font color="#ffff00">But be super careful,
everything is very fragile here.</font>

243
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,350
<font color="#ffff00">Like the Urn of Whispering warriors.</font>

244
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,020
<font color="#ffff00">Someone broke that once.</font>

245
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,750
<font color="#ffff00">Who?
- Some idiot.</font>

246
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,900
<font color="#ffff00">This is master flying Rhino's battle armor.
- I wonder if I could fit in that.</font>

247
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,590
<font color="#ffff00">Get out of my head, dad.
I've wondered the same thing.</font>

248
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,340
<font color="#ffff00">If I could fit in it?
- If you could? No, if I could fit in it.</font>

249
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,360
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, check it out.</font>

250
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,900
<font color="#ffff00">Master Ram's crossbow
The infinite gates smasher.</font>

251
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,870
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, look at this. The battle helmets of
master Rat's army. They're so tiny.</font>

252
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,560
<font color="#ffff00">Master Dolphin's water proof armor.
This is my favorite.</font>

253
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,580
<font color="#ffff00">Check it out. It's the legendary
battle rickshaw of emperor Hawk.</font>

254
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,080
<font color="#ffff00">Sweet ride.</font>

255
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,740
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, what are you doing?
We're not supposed to touch anything.</font>

256
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,241
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh sorry sorry. Should I put it back?</font>

257
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,400
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah you probably should.
You look so cool, though.</font>

258
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,100
<font color="#ffff00">How does it feel? Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?</font>

259
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,450
<font color="#ffff00">Does it feel like you're impenetrable?</font>

260
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,611
<font color="#ffff00">Does it feel like you can take
on a thousand warriors?</font>

261
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,430
<font color="#ffff00">And emerge unscathed?</font>

262
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,650
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, it's pretty cool.</font>

263
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,950
<font color="#ffff00">Wonder what this does?
I should pull it.</font>

264
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,090
<font color="#ffff00">I think I just peed a little.</font>

265
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,480
<font color="#ffff00">Anything else we should try in here, son?</font>

266
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,880
<font color="#ffff00">Charge.</font>

267
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,910
<font color="#ffff00">Faster, faster, faster.</font>

268
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,870
<font color="#ffff00">Thumb war.
- Reinforcements.</font>

269
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,600
<font color="#ffff00">This is so much fun.</font>

270
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,070
<font color="#ffff00">Here we go.
- Awesome.</font>

271
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,429
<font color="#ffff00">There, there.
- I'm fine I'm fine.</font>

272
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,050
<font color="#ffff00">There you go.</font>

273
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
<font color="#ffff00">Dolphin style attack.</font>

274
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,970
<font color="#ffff00">You got me.
- Dolphin style retreat.</font>

275
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,150
<font color="#ffff00">Go long son.</font>

276
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,610
<font color="#ffff00">I wasn't ready.</font>

277
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,939
<font color="#ffff00">Coming back at you.
- I got it.</font>

278
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
<font color="#ffff00">Throw high.
- Yeah, C'mon.</font>

279
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,430
<font color="#ffff00">I'm coming for you.
- Bring it on master Rhino.</font>

280
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,670
<font color="#ffff00">Here I come.</font>

281
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,450
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna get you.</font>

282
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,000
<font color="#ffff00">Who's gonna get you?</font>

283
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,840
<font color="#ffff00">Master Rhino.
- Why, what's wrong?</font>

284
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,000
<font color="#ffff00">Guys guys, you're never gonna
guess who just showed up.</font>

285
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,551
<font color="#ffff00">Not in a million years.</font>

286
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,130
<font color="#ffff00">You can't... you just try.
- Your father.</font>

287
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,660
<font color="#ffff00">Wow, how did you just guess that?</font>

288
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,661
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, wait a second. Yeah of course.
We look exactly the same.</font>

289
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,089
<font color="#ffff00">Say hi to my friends, Mantis
Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper.</font>

290
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,609
<font color="#ffff00">Oh Viper, was it?
- Monkey, sir.</font>

291
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,400
<font color="#ffff00">They're kind of my best friends.</font>

292
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,680
<font color="#ffff00">And this... this is master Shifu.
Legend.</font>

293
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,210
<font color="#ffff00">It is an honor to meet you, master Panda.</font>

294
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,600
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps your father would care to join us
in the training hall?</font>

295
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,541
<font color="#ffff00">Your son will be teaching the class</font>

296
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,710
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sure he's tired.
I'm sure you're tired.</font>

297
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,880
<font color="#ffff00">He's tired. I'm gonna show him
the chrysanthemums suite.</font>

298
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,230
<font color="#ffff00">What? Tired? No, I'm fine.
I would love to watch you teach.</font>

299
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,980
<font color="#ffff00">Trust me.
It would be more fun to watch me.</font>

300
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,310
<font color="#ffff00">Fight.</font>

301
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,290
<font color="#ffff00">What is that?
- The valley is under attack.</font>

302
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,920
<font color="#ffff00">Son? Under attack?
- This is perfect.</font>

303
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,110
<font color="#ffff00">Now you can see what being
the Dragon Warrior is all about.</font>

304
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
<font color="#ffff00">Follow me.</font>

305
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,550
<font color="#ffff00">Enemies of justice.
Prepare for... whoa.</font>

306
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,180
<font color="#ffff00">Are you kidding me?</font>

307
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,160
<font color="#ffff00">What's the deal with the green guys?</font>

308
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,060
<font color="#ffff00">Some kind of jade zombies.
- Jade zombies?</font>

309
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
<font color="#ffff00">Zombies, Jinx.</font>

310
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,790
<font color="#ffff00">Lotus be careful.
- It's OK dad. I do this every...</font>

311
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,500
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa. I recognize this guys.
The master Badger twins.</font>

312
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,270
<font color="#ffff00">With their crushing double gong
technique.</font>

313
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,880
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah that's the one.
That guys is... no.</font>

314
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,960
<font color="#ffff00">Master Porcupine.</font>

315
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,080
<font color="#ffff00">I thought he died hundred
hundred years ago.</font>

316
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,020
<font color="#ffff00">These guys are legends.</font>

317
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,130
<font color="#ffff00">Get a quick sketch of us.</font>

318
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
<font color="#ffff00">Did you get it?
Did you get it?</font>

319
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,850
<font color="#ffff00">Aw, I blinked.
Can we get another one?</font>

320
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,000
<font color="#ffff00">I'm being choked by master Porcupine.
This is so cool.</font>

321
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,900
<font color="#ffff00">Look. It's you.
- Po, focus.</font>

322
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,340
<font color="#ffff00">Message from universe? I'll give you
one message from the universe...</font>

323
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,230
<font color="#ffff00">Stay away from my son.</font>

324
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,030
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry dad. I'll clean it up later. - Whoa,
whoa, not my good pan. Take this one.</font>

325
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,100
<font color="#ffff00">Lotus, watch out.</font>

326
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,160
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, check out my dumplings of doom.</font>

327
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,010
<font color="#ffff00">Gotcha.</font>

328
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,810
<font color="#ffff00">I see you.</font>

329
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,580
<font color="#ffff00">Your chi will soon be mine.</font>

330
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,280
<font color="#ffff00">Is he talking to me?
- Which one? They're all talking.</font>

331
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.</font>

332
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,450
<font color="#ffff00">We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.</font>

333
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,100
<font color="#ffff00">OK but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first</font>

334
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,850
<font color="#ffff00">otherwise it won't be scary,
it'll be just stupid.</font>

335
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:49,690
<font color="#ffff00">It's not them talking. Idiots.</font>

336
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,090
<font color="#ffff00">It's me talking through them, Kai.</font>

337
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,810
<font color="#ffff00">Who?
- OK OK, enough.</font>

338
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,930
<font color="#ffff00">Did you see that? Did you see?
- Whoa, what just happened?</font>

339
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,810
<font color="#ffff00">The green smoke just poof... and then poof
Shifu, what wast that?</font>

340
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,770
<font color="#ffff00">Kai? Kai? Kai.</font>

341
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,320
<font color="#ffff00">Nope. Never heard of him.</font>

342
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,400
<font color="#ffff00">Kai, where is it?
There's so much wisdom in here,</font>

343
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,640
<font color="#ffff00">I can't find anything.</font>

344
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,980
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

345
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,440
<font color="#ffff00">Behold.</font>

346
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,860
<font color="#ffff00">All the answers will be found within.</font>

347
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">What? It's blank?</font>

348
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,280
<font color="#ffff00">Are you kidding me?
Not again.</font>

349
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,160
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry
Oh OK, here we go.</font>

350
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,550
<font color="#ffff00">It is written in Oogway's hand.</font>

351
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,939
<font color="#ffff00">Long ago, I had a brother.
- Oogway had a brother?</font>

352
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,900
<font color="#ffff00">In arms. In arms, sorry.</font>

353
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,580
<font color="#ffff00">He said brother in arms.
- Can you just unroll it all at once?</font>

354
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,120
<font color="#ffff00">I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army.</font>

355
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,820
<font color="#ffff00">And fighting by my side was Kai.</font>

356
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,920
<font color="#ffff00">My closest friend.</font>

357
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,300
<font color="#ffff00">One day we were ambushed.
I was badly wounded.</font>

358
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,480
<font color="#ffff00">My friend carried me for days
looking for help.</font>

359
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,210
<font color="#ffff00">Until we came to a secret
village, high in the mountains.</font>

360
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,360
<font color="#ffff00">An ancient place of healing.</font>

361
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,060
<font color="#ffff00">A village of pandas.</font>

362
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,220
<font color="#ffff00">Pandas?
- Yes, pandas.</font>

363
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,020
<font color="#ffff00">Pandas who used the power
of chi to heal me.</font>

364
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,730
<font color="#ffff00">They taught me how to give chi.</font>

365
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,500
<font color="#ffff00">But Kai wanted the power all to himself.</font>

366
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,010
<font color="#ffff00">He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.</font>

367
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,670
<font color="#ffff00">I had to stop him.</font>

368
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,050
<font color="#ffff00">Our battle shook the Earth.</font>

369
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,290
<font color="#ffff00">Until, finally, I banished Kai to
the spirit realm.</font>

370
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,200
<font color="#ffff00">Should he ever return to the mortal realm</font>

371
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,320
<font color="#ffff00">he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.</font>

372
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,430
<font color="#ffff00">True master of chi?
Like you.</font>

373
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,590
<font color="#ffff00">Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.</font>

374
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,159
<font color="#ffff00">I'd need at least thirty
more years, and a cave.</font>

375
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,200
<font color="#ffff00">Viper: We need a chi master.</font>

376
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,649
<font color="#ffff00">Shifu: He will continue stealing the chi
of masters until he has consumed it all.</font>

377
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,869
<font color="#ffff00">Viper: We have to make a way to stop him.</font>

378
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,960
<font color="#ffff00">Crane: Oh get more more powerful
with every master he defeats.</font>

379
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,959
<font color="#ffff00">Tigress: There is no choice. We fight.</font>

380
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,210
<font color="#ffff00">I can teach you, son.</font>

381
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,640
<font color="#ffff00">You can do this?
- Of course, I'm a panda.</font>

382
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,950
<font color="#ffff00">That must be why the universe
sent you here.</font>

383
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,930
<font color="#ffff00">OK, so what do I have to do?</font>

384
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,950
<font color="#ffff00">You have to come home with me.</font>

385
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,820
<font color="#ffff00">To the secret village?
- Yes, son.</font>

386
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,700
<font color="#ffff00">You must rediscover what
it is to be a panda.</font>

387
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,450
<font color="#ffff00">You have to learn how to live like a panda.
Sleep like a panda.</font>

388
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,040
<font color="#ffff00">Eat like a panda.</font>

389
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,710
<font color="#ffff00">Those 103 dumplings?
Hmm... I was just warming up.</font>

390
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,220
<font color="#ffff00">I've always felt like I wasn't
eating up to my full potential.</font>

391
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,910
<font color="#ffff00">You can't take Po away from me. No, no
I want a second opinion.</font>

392
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,770
<font color="#ffff00">Shifu, open another scroll or something.</font>

393
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,830
<font color="#ffff00">I think he should go.
- Fine. A third opinion.</font>

394
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,920
<font color="#ffff00">Monkey? Viper? Tigress? - Dad you
heard what Shifu said Oogway said.</font>

395
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,770
<font color="#ffff00">This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.</font>

396
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,460
<font color="#ffff00">And I can only master chi by knowing
who I really am.</font>

397
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,350
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm a panda.</font>

398
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,720
<font color="#ffff00">I'll pack your lunch for the road.</font>

399
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,120
<font color="#ffff00">Do you really think Po can master chi
in time? - Doesn't matter what I think.</font>

400
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,220
<font color="#ffff00">It only matters what the universe think.
- So, that's a No?</font>

401
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,110
<font color="#ffff00">Master, what are we going to do?
- You are going to find out where Kai is.</font>

402
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
<font color="#ffff00">Follow the trail of those jade creatures
but do not engage.</font>

403
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,210
<font color="#ffff00">For with every foe he faces
Kai becomes stronger.</font>

404
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,450
<font color="#ffff00">Why me? Is it because I asked.
- No, it is because you can fly.</font>

405
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,870
<font color="#ffff00">Go.
- Should be kept your beak shut.</font>

406
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,699
<font color="#ffff00">And take Mantis.
- What? Oh man, is it because I ...?</font>

407
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

408
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,990
<font color="#ffff00">Lunch break?
- You don't need to ask me twice.</font>

409
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,820
<font color="#ffff00">Dad?
- Yes.</font>

410
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,050
<font color="#ffff00">Dad?
- Yes.</font>

411
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,240
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing here?
- What am I doing? Getting a backache.</font>

412
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,310
<font color="#ffff00">Did you have to step on every rock?</font>

413
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,820
<font color="#ffff00">No, I mean why are you here?
- What was I supposed to do, huh?</font>

414
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,080
<font color="#ffff00">What if the pandas don't
have food you like?</font>

415
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,800
<font color="#ffff00">You're never gonna be able to save
the world on an empty stomach.</font>

416
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,460
<font color="#ffff00">I consider my presence mission critical.</font>

417
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,820
<font color="#ffff00">Oh yes about that. We can't share
the location of the village with others.</font>

418
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,220
<font color="#ffff00">So... - Well, you think I
can't keep a secret, huh?</font>

419
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,670
<font color="#ffff00">I raised Po for twenty years before
I finally told him he was adopted.</font>

420
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,610
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously?
- Yeah.</font>

421
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,150
<font color="#ffff00">OK, I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.</font>

422
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,570
<font color="#ffff00">You can fly?
- I'm a bird, Po.</font>

423
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,250
<font color="#ffff00">We're here.</font>

424
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,670
<font color="#ffff00">Sure looks like a long ways up there.</font>

425
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,800
<font color="#ffff00">And my son hates stairs.
So let's go home.</font>

426
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,370
<font color="#ffff00">We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.</font>

427
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,040
<font color="#ffff00">I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.</font>

428
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,740
<font color="#ffff00">Rats.</font>

429
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa.</font>

430
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,820
<font color="#ffff00">This is the secret panda village?
No wonder you keep it a secret.</font>

431
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,880
<font color="#ffff00">If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.</font>

432
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,130
<font color="#ffff00">Now you can whoa.
- Whoa.</font>

433
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,650
<font color="#ffff00">Li?
Everyone, Li is back.</font>

434
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,739
<font color="#ffff00">They're both back.
- He found his son.</font>

435
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,909
<font color="#ffff00">He made it.
- They're back.</font>

436
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,609
<font color="#ffff00">Li?
- He found his son.</font>

437
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,429
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone, Li is back.</font>

438
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,580
<font color="#ffff00">Hang on, we're coming.</font>

439
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,000
<font color="#ffff00">He made it.</font>

440
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,910
<font color="#ffff00">Why are we running?</font>

441
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,630
<font color="#ffff00">He made it.
- Li shan is back.</font>

442
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,340
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone, everyone gather around.
This is my son.</font>

443
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,210
<font color="#ffff00">Triplets.
- Hi, I'm Ku Ku</font>

444
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,210
<font color="#ffff00">I'm Meng Meng.
- I'm Shuai Shuai, he smells like cookies.</font>

445
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,750
<font color="#ffff00">He's so handsome. Just like his father.
- Thank you.</font>

446
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:32,640
<font color="#ffff00">Son, these are your cousins.
Dim and Sum.</font>

447
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,100
<font color="#ffff00">I have cousins.
- Welcome.</font>

448
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,349
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, buns on a string.
- We call it a snacklace.</font>

449
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,350
<font color="#ffff00">That's right.</font>

450
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,680
<font color="#ffff00">We'll make you another one.</font>

451
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's you.</font>

452
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,380
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, that's nice to see you. Hi.
- I don't know who you are.</font>

453
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,960
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, stripy baby. So beautiful.</font>

454
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,419
<font color="#ffff00">OK, careful with that.
That's my action figure. Can I keep her?</font>

455
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,510
<font color="#ffff00">No... problem. Of course,
yeah that's why I brought her.</font>

456
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:01,809
<font color="#ffff00">Take good care of her.</font>

457
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,360
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, stripy baby.</font>

458
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,840
<font color="#ffff00">You look just like me
but a baby.</font>

459
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,770
<font color="#ffff00">You're like me but old.
You're like me but fatter.</font>

460
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,359
<font color="#ffff00">You're like me but...</font>

461
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,620
<font color="#ffff00">with a hat.</font>

462
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,550
<font color="#ffff00">You all look like me.</font>

463
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,470
<font color="#ffff00">Let's feast in my son's honor.</font>

464
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,670
<font color="#ffff00">What the...?
- Pandas don't walk. We roll.</font>

465
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,870
<font color="#ffff00">How you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?</font>

466
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,920
<font color="#ffff00">Po, what are you doing? Po?</font>

467
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,730
<font color="#ffff00">You're right.
That is better than walking.</font>

468
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,089
<font color="#ffff00">What kind of panda doesn't know
how to roll?</font>

469
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,350
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm kinda new at this whole
being a panda thing.</font>

470
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,330
<font color="#ffff00">And what kind of panda are you?
You have a funny neck.</font>

471
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,460
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not a panda at all.</font>

472
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:24,549
<font color="#ffff00">What's that?
- My hat, My beak, My wing, My dumplings.</font>

473
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,499
<font color="#ffff00">No more questions.
Go away, kid.</font>

474
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,000
<font color="#ffff00">Here, son, I packed your chopsticks.
- Thanks, dad.</font>

475
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,019
<font color="#ffff00">What?
- What are those for?</font>

476
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,320
<font color="#ffff00">These? These are chopsticks
They're for picking up dumplings.</font>

477
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,640
<font color="#ffff00">You mean you only eat one at a time?</font>

478
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,270
<font color="#ffff00">I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential.</font>

479
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,990
<font color="#ffff00">I am Mei Mei.</font>

480
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,650
<font color="#ffff00">Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.</font>

481
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,378
<font color="#ffff00">That's sweet, Po but
please try to save all</font>

482
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,200
<font color="#ffff00">other compliments until
after the performance.</font>

483
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,859
<font color="#ffff00">Me? No, I didn't say...</font>

484
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,450
<font color="#ffff00">Shut it.
After the performance.</font>

485
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,030
<font color="#ffff00">Has it started yet?</font>

486
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,519
<font color="#ffff00">Best ribbon dancer in the world.</font>

487
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,049
<font color="#ffff00">At least that's what she says.
- Look away, look away.</font>

488
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,579
<font color="#ffff00">No, you can't. Can you?</font>

489
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,980
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, why does she keep staring at
me like that? - Try to keep up.</font>

490
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,729
<font color="#ffff00">I don't really know how to dance.
- Of course you do.</font>

491
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,370
<font color="#ffff00">All pandas dance.</font>

492
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,169
<font color="#ffff00">I know what you're thinking.
You do?</font>

493
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,620
<font color="#ffff00">How can one panda be so beautiful?</font>

494
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,100
<font color="#ffff00">For me?</font>

495
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,109
<font color="#ffff00">Help me, dads.
- Yeah, no. You're on your own.</font>

496
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,490
<font color="#ffff00">You're doing great, son.</font>

497
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,190
<font color="#ffff00">Your turn.</font>

498
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,730
<font color="#ffff00">Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.</font>

499
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,590
<font color="#ffff00">I have so much to learn.</font>

500
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,550
<font color="#ffff00">Wings of surveillance.</font>

501
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,549
<font color="#ffff00">Why do you do that?
- Do what?</font>

502
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,130
<font color="#ffff00">Just because you say "Wings of..."</font>

503
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,031
<font color="#ffff00">before something it doesn't mean
that you're doing a special move.</font>

504
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,800
<font color="#ffff00">It's like me saying,
"Antenna of power" or...</font>

505
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,440
<font color="#ffff00">" Thorax of making sandwiches".</font>

506
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,840
<font color="#ffff00">Wings of disagreement.
- Whoa, there.</font>

507
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,580
<font color="#ffff00">Master Bear, master Chicken, Master Croc,
what are you doing out here?</font>

508
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,680
<font color="#ffff00">Jade creatures attacked our villages.
We've tracked them here. Stop.</font>

509
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,070
<font color="#ffff00">They must be in there.</font>

510
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,890
<font color="#ffff00">Master Shifu strongly advised us...</font>

511
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,420
<font color="#ffff00">not to engage.
- Gotta get in there.</font>

512
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,580
<font color="#ffff00">But master Shifu said...
- You're seriously afraid?</font>

513
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,370
<font color="#ffff00">Even master Chicken's going in there
and he's a chicken.</font>

514
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,380
<font color="#ffff00">That's it, I'm going in.
- Mantis, we have orders not to...</font>

515
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,279
<font color="#ffff00">They need our help. Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.</font>

516
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,450
<font color="#ffff00">No, wait.</font>

517
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,930
<font color="#ffff00">Fear the bug.</font>

518
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,629
<font color="#ffff00">Alright, you little...</font>

519
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,530
<font color="#ffff00">Hold on, buddy. I'm coming.
- "Antenna of power".</font>

520
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,590
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, it didn't work.
- Mantis.</font>

521
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,860
<font color="#ffff00">Mantis?</font>

522
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,290
<font color="#ffff00">Mantis?</font>

523
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,310
<font color="#ffff00">Your chi is strong
just like your friend, the bug.</font>

524
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,270
<font color="#ffff00">Mantis.</font>

525
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,790
<font color="#ffff00">Don't worry, little birdie.
I'll put your chi to good use.</font>

526
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,220
<font color="#ffff00">Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.</font>

527
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,500
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

528
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,210
<font color="#ffff00">Wings of... regret.</font>

529
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,540
<font color="#ffff00">Oh yeah, first day of panda training.
Alright flower, I'm gonna make you bloom.</font>

530
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,729
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, dad.</font>

531
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,869
<font color="#ffff00">What? What? What is it? - I'm ready
for my first day of panda training.</font>

532
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,200
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

533
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:11,560
<font color="#ffff00">You know, learn to be a panda,
master chi, save the world.</font>

534
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,919
<font color="#ffff00">Pandas sleep till past noon.</font>

535
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,119
<font color="#ffff00">So lesson number one is
go back to bed.</font>

536
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,620
<font color="#ffff00">Of course.</font>

537
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,460
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody said this was gonna be easy.</font>

538
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,919
<font color="#ffff00">Did I oversleep?
- You sure did.</font>

539
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,109
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

540
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,059
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah show him kids.
- Can you do this? Can you do that?</font>

541
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,629
<font color="#ffff00">How about this? How about that?</font>

542
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,789
<font color="#ffff00">Am I doing it? Is this good?</font>

543
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,210
<font color="#ffff00">I got it.</font>

544
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,460
<font color="#ffff00">Grandma panda, heads up.
- We better roll.</font>

545
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,360
<font color="#ffff00">Po, lunchtime.</font>

546
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,859
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta let the hill tell you
where to roll.</font>

547
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,030
<font color="#ffff00">Rookie mistake. - Dim, Sum, let's
show him how we go uphill.</font>

548
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,290
<font color="#ffff00">That's beautiful.
- Snack time.</font>

549
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,520
<font color="#ffff00">Po, you can fly?
- I'm coming in hot.</font>

550
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,430
<font color="#ffff00">Get them while they're cold.</font>

551
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,520
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing there?
That food is for Po.</font>

552
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,100
<font color="#ffff00">Throw it in.</font>

553
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,670
<font color="#ffff00">There, there, that's it.</font>

554
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,900
<font color="#ffff00">Feeling relaxed?
- Yeah, really.</font>

555
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,010
<font color="#ffff00">Just let yourself fall into it.
- Got it.</font>

556
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,090
<font color="#ffff00">I'm fine. I just...</font>

557
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,229
<font color="#ffff00">There we go.
Just let it all out.</font>

558
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,230
<font color="#ffff00">That's my boy.</font>

559
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,720
<font color="#ffff00">Get out of there.</font>

560
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,570
<font color="#ffff00">My noodles. Leave my noodles alone.</font>

561
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,040
<font color="#ffff00">Subtle, Po. Very subtle.
- Let me get some of that.</font>

562
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,350
<font color="#ffff00">Leave my hat alone.</font>

563
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,530
<font color="#ffff00">We love noodles.
- Oh, just like my Po.</font>

564
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,850
<font color="#ffff00">What are you guys looking at?</font>

565
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,040
<font color="#ffff00">That's how we roll.
Cannonball.</font>

566
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,180
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

567
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,500
<font color="#ffff00">Mom, look it.</font>

568
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,370
<font color="#ffff00">How was that?</font>

569
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,910
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa.</font>

570
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,260
<font color="#ffff00">Now you try again but don't try so hard.
- OK, OK.</font>

571
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,950
<font color="#ffff00">Much better.</font>

572
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,220
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks, dad.
- For what?</font>

573
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,310
<font color="#ffff00">You know, just for you know,
showing me what it feels like...</font>

574
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,960
<font color="#ffff00">to be a panda.</font>

575
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,959
<font color="#ffff00">So when do you think I'll be ready?
Ready?</font>

576
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,039
<font color="#ffff00">You know, learn how to master chi.</font>

577
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,630
<font color="#ffff00">Soon, real soon.</font>

578
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,080
<font color="#ffff00">Come on.
I wanna show you something else. C'mon.</font>

579
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,640
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry about the mess,
I don't usually get visitors.</font>

580
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,350
<font color="#ffff00">Is this my mom?</font>

581
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,890
<font color="#ffff00">I had this done on your
one hundredth day.</font>

582
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,650
<font color="#ffff00">Your mama couldn't hold you still.</font>

583
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,760
<font color="#ffff00">You nearly eat the paper.</font>

584
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,470
<font color="#ffff00">It's true.
- What was she like?</font>

585
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,820
<font color="#ffff00">She was the total package.</font>

586
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,170
<font color="#ffff00">Smart, beautiful.</font>

587
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,240
<font color="#ffff00">Tremendous appetite.</font>

588
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,240
<font color="#ffff00">She was the love of my life.</font>

589
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:39,500
<font color="#ffff00">And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier.</font>

590
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,530
<font color="#ffff00">Along you came, my little Lotus.</font>

591
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,990
<font color="#ffff00">I really had it all.</font>

592
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,130
<font color="#ffff00">Until that one moment...</font>

593
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,479
<font color="#ffff00">When I...</font>

594
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,950
<font color="#ffff00">lost everything.</font>

595
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:45,530
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, you don't have to worry about
losing me ever again, OK?</font>

596
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,760
<font color="#ffff00">Let me get some of that.</font>

597
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,180
<font color="#ffff00">It's from the eastern province.</font>

598
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,500
<font color="#ffff00">Master Lizard, master Ox, master Eagle,
all of them.</font>

599
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,300
<font color="#ffff00">In every village from the sea to here.
Every master in china...</font>

600
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,190
<font color="#ffff00">has vanished.
- Maybe they are all at a party?</font>

601
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,670
<font color="#ffff00">Monkey.
- I didn't get invited either.</font>

602
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,790
<font color="#ffff00">Kai has taken their chi.</font>

603
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:31,539
<font color="#ffff00">We are all that stand between him and
the knowledge Oogway left</font>

604
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,270
<font color="#ffff00">in our care.</font>

605
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,690
<font color="#ffff00">The villagers, evacuated?
- Done, master.</font>

606
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,159
<font color="#ffff00">Crane? Mantis?
- Still nothing.</font>

607
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,650
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, it's them.</font>

608
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,010
<font color="#ffff00">Kai.</font>

609
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,010
<font color="#ffff00">Nice, very tacky.</font>

610
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,410
<font color="#ffff00">How dare you set foot on these grounds.</font>

611
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,840
<font color="#ffff00">Look at your pathetic fools.</font>

612
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,880
<font color="#ffff00">Groveling at the feet of
Oogway the magnificent.</font>

613
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,639
<font color="#ffff00">You are not fit to speak his name.</font>

614
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,860
<font color="#ffff00">I am not fit, little kitten?</font>

615
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:32,170
<font color="#ffff00">I fought by his side. I loved
him like a brother.</font>

616
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,980
<font color="#ffff00">And he betrayed me.</font>

617
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:43,830
<font color="#ffff00">Well now I will destroy
everything he has created.</font>

618
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,000
<font color="#ffff00">Go.</font>

619
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,490
<font color="#ffff00">How's that for a little kitten?</font>

620
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,930
<font color="#ffff00">I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory.</font>

621
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,879
<font color="#ffff00">Why not?
He destroyed mine.</font>

622
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,630
<font color="#ffff00">Mantis, it is me, your bestie.</font>

623
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,340
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry Tigress.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.</font>

624
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,300
<font color="#ffff00">Shifu.
- Bring them to me.</font>

625
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,250
<font color="#ffff00">No, you must warn Po.
- Master please.</font>

626
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,300
<font color="#ffff00">I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.</font>

627
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,130
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

628
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,940
<font color="#ffff00">Oogway, forgive me.</font>

629
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,490
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm, what do you say Oogway?
Do you forgive him?</font>

630
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,890
<font color="#ffff00">You may have destroyed the Jade palace</font>

631
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,280
<font color="#ffff00">but you will never succeed.</font>

632
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,790
<font color="#ffff00">There will always be someone to stop you.</font>

633
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:29,370
<font color="#ffff00">Who? The panda?
His chi is strong but</font>

634
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,410
<font color="#ffff00">it won't be enough.</font>

635
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:36,320
<font color="#ffff00">He will meet the same fate as you.
- No.</font>

636
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,790
<font color="#ffff00">And so will every panda in that village.</font>

637
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,600
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

638
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,150
<font color="#ffff00">Po, I hope you're ready.</font>

639
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,430
<font color="#ffff00">Dance Lotus, dance.</font>

640
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,300
<font color="#ffff00">He's so handsome.</font>

641
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,039
<font color="#ffff00">Hi.
- That's a panda hug.</font>

642
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,540
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

643
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,560
<font color="#ffff00">Po.</font>

644
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,420
<font color="#ffff00">Tigress?</font>

645
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,330
<font color="#ffff00">Who's she?</font>

646
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:06,030
<font color="#ffff00">Baby stripy baby.
- What are you doing here?</font>

647
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,550
<font color="#ffff00">Kai attacked the valley.
He's taken every master in china</font>

648
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,350
<font color="#ffff00">including Shifu and the others.
It's... it's all gone, Po.</font>

649
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,079
<font color="#ffff00">Everything, everyone.
- Everyone?</font>

650
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,580
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone.
- How's my restaurant?</font>

651
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,820
<font color="#ffff00">We'll talk later.
- And now he's on his way here.</font>

652
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,740
<font color="#ffff00">He's after you, Po.
He's after all pandas.</font>

653
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,650
<font color="#ffff00">How long do we have?
- Not long.</font>

654
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,939
<font color="#ffff00">Please tell me you've mastered chi.</font>

655
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,739
<font color="#ffff00">- Here, take the baby. OK,
who belongs to this one?</font>

656
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,229
<font color="#ffff00">You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now.</font>

657
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,479
<font color="#ffff00">I'm afraid you need more time.
Everyone, go get your things.</font>

658
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,869
<font color="#ffff00">Let me hand you that. - I don't have
more time. I need to learn it now.</font>

659
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,359
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, you're not ready.</font>

660
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,250
<font color="#ffff00">OK, pack everything.
- I am ready.</font>

661
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,000
<font color="#ffff00">Not quite.
- What are you talking about?</font>

662
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:50,181
<font color="#ffff00">I've done everything you've asked.</font>

663
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,720
<font color="#ffff00">I mastered napping,
sleeping in hammocks, hot tubs.</font>

664
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,710
<font color="#ffff00">I am totally involved
with my panda parts.</font>

665
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,820
<font color="#ffff00">Now why won't you show me?
- Because I don't know it.</font>

666
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,410
<font color="#ffff00">You what?</font>

667
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,160
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know it, OK?</font>

668
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,799
<font color="#ffff00">No one does.
Maybe we used to but...</font>

669
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,750
<font color="#ffff00">But not anymore.
- You lied?</font>

670
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,600
<font color="#ffff00">No, I...</font>

671
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,480
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.
- Why?</font>

672
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:18,999
<font color="#ffff00">To save your life.</font>

673
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:22,979
<font color="#ffff00">I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you.</font>

674
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,530
<font color="#ffff00">What am I supposed to do?</font>

675
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,489
<font color="#ffff00">Just let that happen?
- Yes, I'm the Dragon Warrior.</font>

676
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,050
<font color="#ffff00">Facing maniacs, that's my job.</font>

677
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,989
<font color="#ffff00">But because of you
I left the valley unprotected.</font>

678
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,000
<font color="#ffff00">I left my friends unprotected.</font>

679
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,090
<font color="#ffff00">And now they're all...
they're all...</font>

680
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,870
<font color="#ffff00">And you would have been, too.</font>

681
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,940
<font color="#ffff00">I lost you once.
I am not going to lose you again.</font>

682
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,620
<font color="#ffff00">I can't.</font>

683
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,820
<font color="#ffff00">You just did.</font>

684
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,200
<font color="#ffff00">Mom, pick me.</font>

685
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,750
<font color="#ffff00">Po, I'm so worried for you that I can't
even enjoy being right about everything.</font>

686
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,870
<font color="#ffff00">Now run, run, run, as fast as
those chubby legs can go.</font>

687
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,080
<font color="#ffff00">Run? There's nowhere to run.
- What are you going to do?</font>

688
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,680
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna stay and
fight that monster.</font>

689
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:34,480
<font color="#ffff00">Po, he may be a monster
but he's still your father.</font>

690
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,630
<font color="#ffff00">Not him, Kai.
- No.</font>

691
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,050
<font color="#ffff00">Hungry?
- No, I... Not really.</font>

692
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, maybe just one.</font>

693
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:33,530
<font color="#ffff00">You know, you weren't the only one
who was lying.</font>

694
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,850
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't really come along because
I was worried Po would go hungry.</font>

695
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,560
<font color="#ffff00">I was worried about you.
- Worried that I'd go hungry?</font>

696
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:47,480
<font color="#ffff00">No, I was worried you'd steal Po from me.
- I'd what?</font>

697
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,000
<font color="#ffff00">I know. That was crazy.</font>

698
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:56,530
<font color="#ffff00">But I realized having you in Po's life
doesn't mean less for me.</font>

699
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,730
<font color="#ffff00">It means more for Po.</font>

700
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,550
<font color="#ffff00">Well I'm not in his life.</font>

701
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,440
<font color="#ffff00">Not any more.
- Your son got mad at you.</font>

702
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,700
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to parenthood.
- You don't understand</font>

703
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,050
<font color="#ffff00">I lied to him.
He'll never forgive me.</font>

704
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,170
<font color="#ffff00">I lied to him for twenty years.
He still thinks he came from an egg.</font>

705
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:24,790
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.</font>

706
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,360
<font color="#ffff00">Look, he's hurt.</font>

707
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:41,100
<font color="#ffff00">He's confused
and he still has to save the world.</font>

708
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,730
<font color="#ffff00">He needs the both his dads.</font>

709
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,120
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't going to work.
- It has to.</font>

710
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,990
<font color="#ffff00">You 're not thinking straight.
- I am.</font>

711
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,119
<font color="#ffff00">You're not.
- I am.</font>

712
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,600
<font color="#ffff00">No Yes, I am.</font>

713
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,660
<font color="#ffff00">I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.</font>

714
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,230
<font color="#ffff00">But he hasn't seen what
I can do.</font>

715
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,200
<font color="#ffff00">The Wuxi finger hold?
- That's my best move.</font>

716
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,090
<font color="#ffff00">I just have to get to Kai,
grab his finger, and then Skadoosh.</font>

717
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:28,696
<font color="#ffff00">Back to the spirit realm.</font>

718
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,730
<font color="#ffff00">He has an army of jade warriors.</font>

719
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,290
<font color="#ffff00">Everything they see he sees
so there's no sneaking up on him.</font>

720
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,280
<font color="#ffff00">You will never get close enough.
- It's gonna work.</font>

721
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,800
<font color="#ffff00">He can only be stopped by a master of chi.</font>

722
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,010
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the chi.
Chi this. Chi that. Chi chi.</font>

723
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,800
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not a master of chi. OK?
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.</font>

724
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,370
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even know if I'm a panda.
I don't know who I am.</font>

725
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,230
<font color="#ffff00">You're right. There's no way
I can stop him and his army.</font>

726
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:06,340
<font color="#ffff00">Unless you had an army of your own.</font>

727
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,640
<font color="#ffff00">You?
- Not just me.</font>

728
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,170
<font color="#ffff00">Us.
- All of us.</font>

729
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,810
<font color="#ffff00">I finally found my son
after all these years.</font>

730
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,270
<font color="#ffff00">It's gonna take a lot more than
the end of the world to keep us apart.</font>

731
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,290
<font color="#ffff00">But you don't even know kung fu.
- Then you will teach us.</font>

732
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,139
<font color="#ffff00">What? I can't teach you kung fu.
I couldn't even teach Tigress.</font>

733
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,330
<font color="#ffff00">And she already knows kung fu.</font>

734
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,210
<font color="#ffff00">Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.</font>

735
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:55,200
<font color="#ffff00">But you gotta believe me.
We can do this.</font>

736
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:00,070
<font color="#ffff00">We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you.</font>

737
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,969
<font color="#ffff00">What did you just say?
- We can do this?</font>

738
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,770
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

739
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,419
<font color="#ffff00">We can learn kung fu?
- After that.</font>

740
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,539
<font color="#ffff00">We can be just like you?</font>

741
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,899
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.
- We can?</font>

742
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,900
<font color="#ffff00">No, you can't.</font>

743
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,639
<font color="#ffff00">But you don't have to be.</font>

744
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,780
<font color="#ffff00">That's what Shifu meant.
I don't have to turn you into me.</font>

745
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:23,090
<font color="#ffff00">I have to turn you into you.
- That doesn't make any sense.</font>

746
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,569
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

747
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:28,320
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks, dads.
- You're welcome?</font>

748
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,870
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna do something I never thought
I'd be able to do.</font>

749
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,780
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna teach kung fu.</font>

750
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,370
<font color="#ffff00">You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best you you can be.</font>

751
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,100
<font color="#ffff00">So who are you?
What are you good at?</font>

752
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,380
<font color="#ffff00">What do you love?
What makes you you?</font>

753
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,700
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, good.
Good, again.</font>

754
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
<font color="#ffff00">Good, again.</font>

755
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,149
<font color="#ffff00">Good, good, good, again.</font>

756
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,300
<font color="#ffff00">Huh?
- Stripy baby, stripy baby.</font>

757
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,840
<font color="#ffff00">Faster, faster.
Roll those ribbons.</font>

758
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,000
<font color="#ffff00">Hug that log you, hug that log
like it's the last time</font>

759
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:10,269
<font color="#ffff00">you're ever gonna hug it.
Goodbye forever.</font>

760
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,490
<font color="#ffff00">Higher, and a little more to the
left this time. You can do it.</font>

761
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,440
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wanna see any of these
hit the ground.</font>

762
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,900
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, wait, stripy baby.</font>

763
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,950
<font color="#ffff00">Good, try it with this.</font>

764
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,320
<font color="#ffff00">Now try it with these.</font>

765
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,300
<font color="#ffff00">Good, now try it with these.</font>

766
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,540
<font color="#ffff00">They are ready.</font>

767
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,310
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

768
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,810
<font color="#ffff00">OK pay attention cause I might gonna
go over this ten more times.</font>

769
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,770
<font color="#ffff00">The only entrance to the village is here.</font>

770
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,830
<font color="#ffff00">The dumpling squadron
will take position here</font>

771
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:36,829
<font color="#ffff00">while the cookie squadron
will take position here.</font>

772
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,260
<font color="#ffff00">Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...</font>

773
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:45,220
<font color="#ffff00">Alright OK.
The noodle squadron will...</font>

774
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,510
<font color="#ffff00">anyway, the important thing to remember
is that this is the spot where...</font>

775
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,890
<font color="#ffff00">OK, I saw that coming.
If you only remember one thing,</font>

776
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,340
<font color="#ffff00">it's just distract the zombies until
I get close enough to put the.</font>

777
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,100
<font color="#ffff00">Wuxi finger hold on Kai. Got it?</font>

778
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,279
<font color="#ffff00">Pandas on three. One, two, three
panda, you guys...</font>

779
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,390
<font color="#ffff00">Never mind.
I'll teach you that later.</font>

780
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,130
<font color="#ffff00">I wish I could have thought
you this, son.</font>

781
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,150
<font color="#ffff00">It's OK, dad. I'm...</font>

782
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,110
<font color="#ffff00">He's here.</font>

01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,020
<font color="#ffff00">Beast of vengeance, maker of widows.</font>

787
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,109
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, finally.</font>

788
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:51,820

your life. - Oh, you wanna spare me?</font>

01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,570
<font color="#ffff00">Oh no, it's true.
You guys have all been turned green.</font>

797
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:37,330
<font color="#ffff00">Except for you, Mantis,
you were already green.</font>

798
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,610
<font color="#ffff00">Now?
- Wait for the signal.</font>

799
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,790
<font color="#ffff00">Here we go.</font>

804
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, Crane.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Spring roll squad
Time for some takeout.</font>

806

807
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,630

810
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,460
<font color="#ffff00">Sweet.</font>

811
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,790
<font color="#ffff00">Stripy baby.</font>

812
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,100
<font color="#ffff00">Do it.
- You're mean.</font>

813
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,280
<font color="#ffff00">Fire.</font>

814
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,140
<font color="#ffff00">Fire in the hole.</font>

815
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,430
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

816
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,040
<font color="#ffff00">All right kids.
You got it guys.</font>

817
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,680
<font color="#ffff00">Oh no, master Shifu.</font>

818
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,900
<font color="#ffff00">I can't hit Shifu.</font>

819
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,190
<font color="#ffff00">I can.
- And so can I.</font>

820
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,409
<font color="#ffff00">Double dad defense.</font>

- Right, dad.</font>

822
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,570
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks dad.</font>

823
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:50,810
<font color="#ffff00">Back at you then.</font>

824
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,460
<font color="#ffff00">We've got this, son.
- Go, dads.</font>

825
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">We got 'em now.
- Stop, stop, enough.</font>

826
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,080
<font color="#ffff00">Let's finish this.</font>

827
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,980
<font color="#ffff00">That's our boy.</font>

828
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,320
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to
the spirit realm. Skadoosh.</font>

829
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:42,929
<font color="#ffff00">OK, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time. Skadoosh.</font>

830
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,450
<font color="#ffff00">Skadoosh, skadoosh, skadoosh.
What the?</font>

831
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,689
<font color="#ffff00">Hold on, wait. It's working.</font>

832
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,430
<font color="#ffff00">No, no.</font>

833
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:58,580
<font color="#ffff00">No, it's not. Did Oogway
teach you that little trick?</font>

834
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:02,430
<font color="#ffff00">Too bad. It only works on mortals.</font>

835
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,500
<font color="#ffff00">And I am a spirit warrior.</font>

836
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,080
<font color="#ffff00">Come.</font>

837
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,130
<font color="#ffff00">Son.
- Po.</font>

838
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,330
<font color="#ffff00">I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Run, run.</font>

839
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:19,640
<font color="#ffff00">So Oogway, this was the one
destined to stop me?</font>

840
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:24,740
<font color="#ffff00">I will have his chi
and then all of theirs.</font>

841
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,070
<font color="#ffff00">And you...</font>

842
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:48,830
<font color="#ffff00">You really thought you can
send me back to the spirit realm?</font>

843
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,430
<font color="#ffff00">You are just a stupid mortal.</font>

844
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,570
<font color="#ffff00">It only works on mortals.</font>

845
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,900
<font color="#ffff00">You're right.
I can't send you there.</font>

846
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:09,000
<font color="#ffff00">But I can take you there.
What's that?</font>

847
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,400
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

848
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,230
<font color="#ffff00">Po.
- Son.</font>

849
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,200
<font color="#ffff00">Skadoosh.</font>

850
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,010
<font color="#ffff00">Son.</font>

851
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:18,940
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

852
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,880
<font color="#ffff00">What happened?
Where is Po?</font>

853
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,590
<font color="#ffff00">He took Kai away.
He saved us.</font>

854
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,270
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

855
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,410
<font color="#ffff00">He saved us
but who's saving him?</font>

856
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,629
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, the spirit realm.
It worked.</font>

857
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,450
<font color="#ffff00">Get off me, you...</font>

858
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,430
<font color="#ffff00">You brought me back?</font>

859
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:09,520
<font color="#ffff00">Don't blame me. I tried to finish this
in the regular realm.</font>

860
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,980
<font color="#ffff00">And we'll finish it here.</font>

861
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,170
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, son.
Fight.</font>

862
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,050
<font color="#ffff00">We have to help him.</font>

863
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,930
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone gather around.
That's it. Come in close.</font>

864
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,500
<font color="#ffff00">Come on.
We can do this.</font>

865
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,520
<font color="#ffff00">Po, you taught us who
we were meant to be.</font>

866
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:22,170
<font color="#ffff00">A father.</font>

867
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,650
<font color="#ffff00">A friend.
- A dumpling kicker.</font>

868
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:32,300
<font color="#ffff00">A lethal fighting machine.
- A huger.</font>

869
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,470
<font color="#ffff00">A nunchuck chick.</font>

870
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,450
<font color="#ffff00">Stripy baby.</font>

871
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,940
<font color="#ffff00">A family.</font>

872
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,270
<font color="#ffff00">Sweet.</font>

873
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,620
<font color="#ffff00">Who are you?
- I've been asking the same question.</font>

874
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,300
<font color="#ffff00">Am I the son of a panda?</font>

875
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,780
<font color="#ffff00">The son of a goose?
A student?</font>

876
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,590
<font color="#ffff00">A teacher?</font>

877
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,690
<font color="#ffff00">Turns out, I'm all of them.</font>

878
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,750
<font color="#ffff00">I am the Dragon Warrior.</font>

879
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,540
<font color="#ffff00">Get it?
See the giant dragon?</font>

880
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,580
<font color="#ffff00">Get ready to feel the thunder.</font>

881
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,870
<font color="#ffff00">This is awesome.</font>

882
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,790
<font color="#ffff00">Belly gong.</font>

883
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,590
<font color="#ffff00">Butt slap.</font>

884
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,290
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps a bit of lunch
cause I'm starving.</font>

885
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,750
<font color="#ffff00">Let's do this.</font>

886
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,200
<font color="#ffff00">Heads up.</font>

887
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:30,230
<font color="#ffff00">It took me five hundred years
to take Oogway's chi.</font>

888
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,810
<font color="#ffff00">I will have yours if it takes me
five hundred more.</font>

889
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,620
<font color="#ffff00">Chtity chitty chat chat, chitchat.</font>

890
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:50,910
<font color="#ffff00">You want my chi so bad?
Then take it.</font>

891
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:01,980
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, the power is mine.</font>

892
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:09,930
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, no. It's too much.
That's too much. No.</font>

893
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,400
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

894
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,210
<font color="#ffff00">Where'd he go?</font>

895
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,859
<font color="#ffff00">We're back.
- Bestie.</font>

896
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,860
<font color="#ffff00">I'm still green. It didn't work.</font>

897
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,270
<font color="#ffff00">Oh wait, that's my normal green.</font>

898
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,210
<font color="#ffff00">Stripy baby.
- Not a baby, not a baby.</font>

899
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,719
<font color="#ffff00">What about Po?</font>

900
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,420
<font color="#ffff00">Have you seen Po?
- No, he's not here?</font>

901
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,380
<font color="#ffff00">Po... Po.</font>

902
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:58,320
<font color="#ffff00">Why isn't he back?</font>

903
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:12,260
<font color="#ffff00">Dragon warrior.
- Oogway?</font>

904
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,549
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe it.</font>

905
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:21,170
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa, you're extra shiny.
- As are you.</font>

906
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,480
<font color="#ffff00">I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.</font>

907
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:25,479
<font color="#ffff00">When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.</font>

908
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,800
<font color="#ffff00">It suits you.
You've grown.</font>

909
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,870
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I gotta lay off the panda buffet.
- Grown up.</font>

910
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:36,690
<font color="#ffff00">As I hoped you would when
I sent the message to your father.</font>

911
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,100
<font color="#ffff00">You sent the universe mail? Whoa.</font>

912
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,310
<font color="#ffff00">Yes because the universe needed you.</font>

913
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,520
<font color="#ffff00">You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.</font>

914
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:56,110
<font color="#ffff00">But how'd you know I could?
- On the first day we met...</font>

915
01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:00,210
<font color="#ffff00">I saw the future of kung fu.</font>

916
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,740
<font color="#ffff00">And the past.</font>

917
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,510
<font color="#ffff00">I saw the panda
who could unite them both.</font>

918
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,500
<font color="#ffff00">That is why I chose you, Po.</font>

919
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,390
<font color="#ffff00">Both sides of the Yin and Yang.</font>

920
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">And my true successor.</font>

921
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,550
<font color="#ffff00">Me? I can't take that.
- Yes, take it.</font>

922
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,780
<font color="#ffff00">I have a bigger one.</font>

923
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,960
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, you're enlightening everything
I'm just...</font>

924
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,820
<font color="#ffff00">Really?
- Yes.</font>

925
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,679
<font color="#ffff00">Now what we do?</font>

926
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,280
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm, you tell me.
- No Oogway, don't go.</font>

927
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,330
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.</font>

928
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,990
<font color="#ffff00">Oh right.</font>

929
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:06,999
<font color="#ffff00">It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.</font>

930
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,610
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, I can go back?
- Who knows?</font>

931
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,290
<font color="#ffff00">I've never tried.</font>

932
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:44,180
<font color="#ffff00">Po.
- You can fly.</font>

933
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:54,470
<font color="#ffff00">Dad, dad, dads.
- Son.</font>

934
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,000
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.</font>

935
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,150
<font color="#ffff00">We thought we lost you.</font>

936
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,750
<font color="#ffff00">No, you saved me.
You all did.</font>

937
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,630
<font color="#ffff00">Now come on over here.</font>

938
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,420
<font color="#ffff00">Hugs.</font>

939
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:19,009
<font color="#ffff00">Master Shifu.
- The student has truly become the tea...</font>

940
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,050
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, where did you get that?</font>

941
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:24,049
<font color="#ffff00">Oh this. Oogway gave it to me
in the spirit realm.</font>

942
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:28,260
<font color="#ffff00">Of course he did.
- I think I mastered chi.</font>

943
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:32,130
<font color="#ffff00">Of course you did.</font>

944
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,020
<font color="#ffff00">Can you teach me?</font>

945
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,810
<font color="#ffff00">Ready.</font>

946
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,970
<font color="#ffff00">Monkey, help me.
- Greeny baby.</font>

947
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,170
<font color="#ffff00">Get off me.</font>

948
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,600
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.</font>

949
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,520
<font color="#ffff00">Skadoosh.</font>

950
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,260
<font color="#ffff00">Panda asthma.</font>
