00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,203
You want to kill Dom?

330
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,122
Line's around the block.

331
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,957
No, no, no.

332
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,462
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

333
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,922
But I need your help.

334
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,633
Your toys and your tech.

335
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,218
All your boys.

336
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,554
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

(groans)

338
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,349
I don't play well with others.

339
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,309
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

340
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,935
You're looking at
who I love most.

341
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,064
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

342
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,399
I wasn't talking to you.

343
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,027
I was talking to Zeke.

344
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,113
Amir.

345
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,824
Kevin's dad.

356
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,189
except that poor bastard.
(chuckles)

357
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,233
Not even a kitty cat.

358
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,861
The rest of you have a choice.

359
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,616
Me or...

360
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,457
You want to control the world.

361
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,212
I just want to punish it.

362
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,010
I will remember this.

363
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,222
I think everyone will.

operate this, don't I?

367

Come with me.

368
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,730
All right, you know what to do

369
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,482
if you want to see
your families again.

370

to our black site.

401
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,080
- She may not make it.
- But did her story check out?

402
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,665
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

403
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,250
but her tech wasn't there.

404
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,711
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

- You've alerted your people?
- Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

- No answer.
- Any idea where they might be?

In Rome.

409
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,976
Working for you.

410
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,813
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

411
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,690
It's a setup.

412
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,692
Shit.

413

No matter what happens.

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,383
And I always keep my promises.

00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,066
(door locks clicking, beeping)

493
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,276
We're locked inside!

494
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,779
The truck's being
steered remotely.

495
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,907
(Dante humming
dramatic classical music)

496
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,995
(indistinct chatter
over speaker)

497
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,251
And a one, and a two, and a...

498
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,630
(Dante laughs)

499
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,758
(people screaming, clamoring)

500
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,846
ROMAN:
Holy shit! What happened?!

501
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,516
Put a little too much in, huh?
(chuckles) Ready?

502
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,896
(grunts)

503
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,774
(laughs)

504
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,401
That was awesome!

505
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,569
Ooh. (grunts)

506
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,030
Scusi!

507
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,197
(yelling, grunting)

508
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,866
HAN:
They're stealing our truck.

509
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,869
RAMSEY:
And with us inside.

510
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,165
Just got reports of
two explosions near the Forum.

511
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,958
That's them.

512
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,586
(engine revving)

513
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,132
Ready? And...

514
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,550
- (electronic whirring)
- Wait, you hear that?

515
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,970
- What the hell is that?!
- I have no idea!

516
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,139
(electronic whirring
grows louder)

517
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,223
Oh, shit.

518
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,475
That's a big-ass bomb!

519
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,268
- What?
- Bomb!

520
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,270
RAMSEY: Roman, you said
this was carrying chips

521
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,480
for a supercomputer.

522
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,899
That is not a chip.
It's a bomb!

523
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,525
What happens if it goes off?

524
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,861
What do you mean,
"What happens if it goes off?"

525
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,738
The Seven Hills of Rome
will be down to two and a half!

526
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,824
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

527
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,534
You know, the thing bombs do.

528
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,411
We're coming to you.

529
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,039
(tires squealing)

530
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,168
All right, dorks.
What are we blowing up?

531
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,294
What?

532
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,754
The Vatican?

533
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,381
Wow.

534
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,757
Okay. I'll do it.

535
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
But you guys are going to hell.

536
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,805
DOM:
That's their truck.

537
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,475
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

538
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,727
Ooh. Look who's here.

539
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,895
You're right on time, Dominic.

540
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,773
Turn off the encrypted radio.

541
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,858
Ramsey?

542
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,611
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

543
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,322
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

544
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,408
(people clamoring)

545
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,993
LITTLE NOBODY:
Ah! Found it.

546
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,286
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

547
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,288
I just need physical hands
on the device.

548
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,290
- We have to stop that truck.
- Sorry, Captain America.

549
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,876
Can't let you do that.

550
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,007
LETTY: We got to hurry!
The truck is speeding up.

551
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,759
- We got to block its path.
- I'm gonna get ahead of it.

552
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,179
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

553
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,559
Whoop.

554
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,561
(groaning)

555
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,397
(purrs)

556
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,695
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

557
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,492
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

558
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,203
Dominic.

559
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,457
Come on!

560
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,585
Damn it, he's fast.

561
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,509
Really? The clothesline?

562
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,969
Well, we can't drive it,

563
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,722
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

564
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,604
(Ramsey grunts)

565
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,071
(both screaming)

566
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,910
LETTY: Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

567
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,580
- We have to crash into it.
- We have to what?!

568
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,127
- (grunts)
- (screams)

569
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,717
(tires squealing)

570
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,263
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

571
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,350
It's not stopping!

572
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,104
HAN:
Dom, the bomb is out.

573
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,316
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

574
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,194
No. We got this.

575
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,126
Letty!

576
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,845
(people screaming)

577
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,388
Have we made them all
terrorists?

578
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,848
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

579
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,392
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

580
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,018
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

581
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,728
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

582
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,774
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

583
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,791
(sirens wailing)

584
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,919
(urgent chatter in Italian)

585
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,174
(shouts angrily in Italian)

586
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,392
Buongiorno, Roma!

587
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,935
All right.

588
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,354
(engine starts)

589
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,066
- (radio static squealing)
- (Dante singing in Italian)

590
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,153
(singing continues)

591
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,946
Man, who the hell is that?

592
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,489
(chuckles):
Hey! There he is!

593
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,825
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

594
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,412
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one. (laughs)

595
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,040
(people screaming)

596
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,837
DANTE (singsongy):
Oh, Letty!

597
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,172
LETTY:
I think I found our guy.

598
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,090
Hey, Letty. Vaffanculo!

599
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,300
(blows raspberries)

600
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm on him.

601
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,693
That pump's gonna blow.

602
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,866
- (people screaming)
- (grunts)

603
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,954
(screams)

604
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,839
(laughs)

605
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,928
- (tires screeching)
- (people shouting)

606
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,913
DOM:
Little Nobody, you're up.

607
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,165
- (mutters)
- (horn honks)

608
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,755
- Moving to dis...
- Peekaboo!

609
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,216
(laughs)

610
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,934
Get out of there! It's gonna blow!
-Oh, shit.

611
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,186
(rapid beeping)

612
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,731
- Boom.
- (grunts)

613
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,742
(officer shouts)

614
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,913
(people clamoring)

615
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,382
(tires squealing)

616
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,015
(people screaming)

617
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,323
(barking)

618
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,501
We need to jam
the detonator now.

619
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,754
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

620
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,757
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

621
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,425
cellular interference
through your phone.

622
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,096
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

623
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,184
Letty.

624
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,481
(people screaming)

625
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,943
(grunts)

626
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,619
(laughs)

627
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,054
(grunts)

628
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,723
(tires screeching)

629
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,018
Bravo!

630
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,478
It's getting tricky, guys.

631
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,272
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

632
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,232
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

633
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,359
The Tiber? Uh...

634
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,861
Uh, 60 feet.

635
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,404
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

636
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,739
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

637
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,326
(sputtering radio static)

638
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,749
(sirens wailing)

639
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,755
- (woman gasps)
- (officers shouting)

640
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,675
LETTY:
Damn it!

641
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,678
(laughs) You missed me
by that much, baby!

642
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,846
(laughs)

643
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,849
(grunts)

644
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,642
I lost him. He's gone.

645
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,060
- TEJ: Damn!
- (device beeping)

646
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,187
He's out of our reach.

647
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,771
We can't jam the signal anymore.

648
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,609
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

649
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,487
(beeping)

650
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,913
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

651
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,835
RAMSEY: Dom, he armed the bomb,
and you're almost at the river.

652
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,811
(sighs)

653
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,486
(horns blaring)

654
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,822
(grunts)

655
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,370

Oh, sightseeing,

721
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,929

they did it.

722

If it violates the laws of God

You write that yourself?

724
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,271
We first took notice in 2011,

725
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,774
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

726
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,609
left his body on a bridge.

727
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,405
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

728
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,657
so he recruited them...
Freelance, of course.

729
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,868
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

730
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,537
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

731
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,539
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

732
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,208
but they had their champions.

733
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,710
That's their M.O.

734
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,628
To corrupt law enforcement.

735
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,005
Brian O'Conner.

736
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,798
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

737
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,633
Everyone becomes family.

738
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,552
It's like a cult with cars.

739
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,056
Even Tess's dear old dad.

740
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,224
So we're all just

741
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,810
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

742
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,145
What's your point?

743
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,563
Point is they're criminals.

744
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,398
Rome was a matter of time.

745
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,108
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

746
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,445
and at least one nuclear sub.

747
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:57,073
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

748
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,743
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

749
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,413
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

750
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,415
Something is not right
with Rome.

751
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,583
It can't be.

752
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,960
It can and it is.

753
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,754
The agency is better than this.

754
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,255
We are smarter than this.

755
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,799
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

756
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,383
That is the very least
that we can do.

757
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,219
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

758
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,972
The fallout will be existential.

759

The agency has turned its back

- Mm-hmm.

952
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,421
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

953
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,716
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

954
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,385
I pulled a screen grab

955

off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

956

put it in God's Eye.

any enemies in Rio, would you?

959
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,770
- Reyes.
- Hernan Reyes?

960
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:15,567
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

961
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,529
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

962
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,866
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

963
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,202
Letty.

964
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,249
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

965
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,583
Then get her out.

966
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,127
Nobody can.

967
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,920
Nobody would.

968
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,380
Dom, I'm so sorry,

969
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,759
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

970
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,974
(Dom sighs heavily)

971
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,644
Nothing's impossible.

972
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,066
You just have to have faith.

I'm sorry we didn't
get to meet in Roma.

1139
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,423
We were both so busy.

1140
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,593
I'm Dante. Enchanté.

1141
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:44,640
And you were
fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.

1142
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,559
He saved the Vatican.

1143
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,810
Who does that? (chuckles)

1144
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,063
Seriously. The Pope? God?

1145
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,982
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

1146
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,775
The ball through the city was

1147
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,486
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

1148
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,656
Except it was on fire.
(chuckles)

1149
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,827
You remember my father?

1150
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,413
- Hernan Reyes.
- Yes.

1151
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,708
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

1152
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,251
But you know what happened?

1153
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,503
I took him down.

1154
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,923
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

1155
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,508
You are absolutely right.

1156
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,136
My father was a horrible man,

1157
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,722
very bad daddy,

1158
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,599
but I kind of liked him.

1159
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,268
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

1160
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,770
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

1161
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,815
Well, that's what
I came here for.

1162
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,526

1163

that money.

1166
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,243

1167

(high-pitched):
Uh-oh.

1168

1169
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,374

you can buy everything.

1174
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,013

1179

that the wrong sister died.

1457
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,482
Why the good one and not me?

1458
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,360
(sniffles)

1459
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,453
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

1460
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,457
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

1461
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,253
A cop and a street racer.

1462
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,213
I'll tell you something.

1463
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,259
They travel down the same road
long enough...

1464
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:18,597
and they realize
how much alike they really are.

1465
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,643
Trust me...

1466
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,355
I know.

1467
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,450
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1468
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,497
She's still helping people.

1469
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,503
She's helping us.

1470
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,964
You know, Elena,

1471
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,341
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1472
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,093
After they killed her husband,

1473
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,929
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1474
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,309
I think I still have her files.

1475
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:07,145
ROMAN: Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear

1476
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,646
in the middle of London?

1477
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,482
RAMSEY: You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1478
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,400
- ("Give It Up" playing)
- (entry bell chimes)

1479
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,194
- (modem dialing)
- (quiet chatter)

1480
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:17,405
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

1481
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,699
Would you look for
a black-market operation

1482
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,327
in a place like this?

1483
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,454
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You've got mail.

1484
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,499
- Ooh, snacks.
- Get me a receipt, homey.

1485
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,752
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1486
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,170
How about you figure it out?

1487
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,714
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1488
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,090
(whispers):
I swear to God...

1489
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,717
(taps desk)

1490
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,177
RAMSEY:
What's up, Bowie420?

1491
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,722
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1492
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,683
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1493
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,935
(giggles)

1494
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,478
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

1495
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,230
online black markets.

1496
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,148
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1497
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,691
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

1498
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,235
RAMSEY:
Well, desperate times.

1499
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,778
What kind of muffins are these?

1500
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,946
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1501
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,489
You have like four of them,

1502
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,115
you'll be in your underwear
watching Fantasia.

1503
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,450
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

1504
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,077
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1505
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,328
(Roman clears throat)

1506
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,455
RAMSEY:
We, uh, we need transport.

1507
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,707
Weapons, cars, the works.

1508
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,125
And quietly.

1509
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,794
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1510
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,170
None of that crypto stuff.

1511
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,297
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

1512
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,842
Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

1513
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,052
Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

1514
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,137
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

1515
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,389
you know what I'm saying?

1516
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,432
How much we talking about, bruh?

1517
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,018
Just like a reasonable amount.

1518
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,604
ROMAN:
How about that?

1519
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,565
That won't even cover
the muffins.

1520
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,816
Is this guy serious?

1521
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,776
ROMAN:
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1522
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,029
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1523
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,490
- (sighs)
- ROMAN: Well, how about that?

1524
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,158
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

1525
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,869
Man, give me this.

1526
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,662
- Thank you.
- Are you serious right now?

1527
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,998
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1528
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,833
You should pay for everything.

1529
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:55,003
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1530
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,463
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1531
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,507
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1532
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,842
TEJ:
No, I'm tired of this.

1533
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,260
'Cause all he do is talk.

1534
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,596
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

1535
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,930
What are you saying, Tej?

1536
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,599
- Mean, what I'm saying?
- BOWIE: Hey, guys.

1537
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,642
- This is a family environment.
- What? Really?

1538
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,603
- Really?
- BOWIE: Take it outside, fellas.

1539
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:14,272
So, what we doing, bruh?

1540
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,648
BOWIE:
Uh-oh.

1541
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,235
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!
- (Tej and Roman grunting)

1542
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,696
- Oh, not the vending machine. No.
- WOMAN: Unbelievable.

1543
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,699
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1544
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,534
MAN:
Let's go. Come on.

1545
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,662
Should we stop this?

1546
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,958
- TEJ: Hold on!
- Nah, let 'em bond.

1547
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,252
BOWIE: Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

1548
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,337
(audio distorting)

1549
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,048
(distorted):
Huh?

1550
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,885
BOWIE (echoing):
What the hell, man?

1551
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,889
- (normal audio resumes)
- (grunting)

1552
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,476
(groaning)

1553
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,563
Okay. All right.

1554
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,856
We doing stomachs now.

1555
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,483
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1556
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,109
- You've been wanting that for years!
- BOWIE: Uh, I think

1557
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,363
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

1558
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,242
What the hell was that?

1559
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,410
He's like a ghetto magician.

1560
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,371
You know what it is, bruh.

1561
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,456
- I beat your ass.
- You just beat my ass?

1562
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,749
- Beat my ass, huh?
- My God,

1563
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,125
will you two just quit it?
Please.

1564
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,127
We don't have time for this.
You.

1565
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,754
- Get to work.
- Oh, I just need

1566
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,673
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1567
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,716
Oops.

1568
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,551
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1569
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,011
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

1570
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,680
like, all over the dark web.

1571
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,515
I mean, that reward is dope.

1572
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,183
- (groans) Ow. Hey.
- We have to move.

1573
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,686
- The agency's minutes away.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

1574
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,146
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
- What? Huh?

1575
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,189
- Oh!
- ROMAN: Oh!

1576
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,358
(groans) I deserved that.

1577
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,111
- Are you okay, bro?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

1578
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,612
(groans, grunts)

1579
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,533
- (laughing)
- (grunting angrily)

1580
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,993
All right, so where to now, huh?

1581
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,369
- Jail?
- (siren wailing in distance)

1582
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,707
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

1583
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,836
- (quiet chatter)
- (machines beeping)

1584
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,507
(sighs)

1585
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,560
- (vents whirring)
- (gas hissing)

1586
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,688
(people coughing)

1587
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,817
CIPHER: How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1588
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,820
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1589
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,574
It's a sick place, Letty.

1590
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,327
You're welcome.

1591
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,829
What did you do?

1592
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,915
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1593
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:41,335
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1594
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,214
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1595
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,426
(vents whirring)

1596
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:51,596
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

1597
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,597
(scoffs)

1598
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,058
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1599
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,895
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1600
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,065
(whispers):
Shit.

1601
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,860
LETTY:
Seems like you got this covered.

1602
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,695
- What do you need me for?
- I have a plan,

1603
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,282
but it's a two-person job.

1604
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,539
(mechanical hissing)

1605
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,876
Now, was that so hard?

1606
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,753
How much time do we have?

1607
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,922
I'd say about four minutes.

1608
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,006
It'll have to do.

1609
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,800
♪ Then I ball like Spalding ♪

1610

You might want to buckle up.

1935
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,376
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

1936
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,337
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

1937
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,297
But it's a new day.

1938
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:52,593
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

1939
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,682
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1940
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,976
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1941
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,562
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

1942
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:08,525
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1943
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,361
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1944
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,281
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1945
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,950
Hell, the days of any man

1946
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,994
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

Preparing for what's to come.

1950
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,879

01:40:08,044 --> 01:40:09,836
And I have a surprise for you.

01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,362
Dominic!

1977
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,197
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1978
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,866
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1979
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:22,827
Oh.

1980
01:41:22,828 --> 01:41:25,453
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1981
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:27,080
That little car stunt
you just did?

1982
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,248
That was pretty awesome.

1983
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,416
Wasn't it?

1984
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:30,834
(high-pitched):
It was so cool.

1985
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:32,877
(normal voice):
But if you don't stop,

1986
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,089
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1987
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,382
Badly.

- Hmm.
- Fashionably late.

1992

You got me.

1993

Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

2102
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:43,122
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

really ain't for me.

You took us to London
on a container.

You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

2107
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:56,094
strapped to your ass,

2108
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,638
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

2109
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,723
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

2110

for something that we all wear.

2111

Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

2112

Nah, it don't sound stupid

2113
