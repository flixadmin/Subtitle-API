1
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,269
All clear, Ms. Kramer.

2
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:23,900
Four scans and three weapon checks.
I like the way you think, Agent Cooper.

3
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,277
Were you this serious
back at Fort Dakota?

4
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,488
The army fights
terrestrial threats, ma'am.

5
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,867
Here, it's that, plus a little extra.

6
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,037
- I know what you mean.
- As for the added lockdown?

7
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,082
We're gonna need it
for what you're proposing, ma'am.

8
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,820
<i>The famous meta-human Killer Frost</i>

9
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>will be sentenced today...</i>

10
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:13,324
- So much for re-branding.
- Cecile, how bad is this?

11
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,579
Typically, Frost's charges carry
a sentence of ten to twenty years.

12
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:21,874
But today Judge Tanaka
is gonna weigh that

13
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,127
against all the good
that she's done as a hero.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,922
And given that Frost
hasn't committed a crime in four years,

15
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,425
I can make a case
for a lighter sentence.

16
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,510
Eighteen months,
maybe less, with parole.

17
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,096
I mean, she already pled guilty
and skipped her trial.

18
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,240
What more does the court want?

19
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,892
They want to know whether or not
you are responsible for your crimes.

20
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,519
This is a load of crap.

21
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:44,063
You've saved the city
and more lives than I can count.

22
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,958
Jitters named a freaking
drink after you.

23
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:46,982
Exactly.

24
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,403
You know, I say we just make
like <i>A Few Good Men</i>

25
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,365
and just shove the truth
down the city's throat.

26
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,074
Guys, we're not looking for a loophole.
I did these crimes.

27
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,037
Caity, I know you want to help,
but ever since becoming my own person,

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,166
I've realized that if I don't own up
for my choices,

29
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,500
I'll never be able to move on.

30
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,347
What about all
the good things you've done?

31
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,438
About the life we're building together?

32
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,214
I miss you too.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,053
But until I pay for what I did,

34
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,639
the rest of the city
won't look at me the way you all do.

35
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,310
Isotopic signature detected.

36
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,689
- The Forces. One of them is close.
- It's coming from Keystone City.

37
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,610
- Seismic isotopes.
- It's the Strength Force.

38
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:33,529
Barry, you have to go.
This is the chance we're waiting for.

39
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,825
- Listen to the cosmic lady. Go.
- She's right.

40
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,704
If Fuerza's back, people need the Flash.
We've got Frost's back.

41
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,349
Iris is running comms.

42
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,373
I'll come with you.

43
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,919
If that monster is here,
it won't be a match for us both.

44
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,284
<i>You sure this is the right location?</i>

45
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,828
Yeah. Satellites confirm it.
Fuerza should be right in front of you.

46
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,978
<i>Why? What are you seeing?</i>

47
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,523
Either our satellites
need to be recalibrated or...

48
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,317
The Strength Force is
better at hiding than we thought.

49
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,743
Keystone Cares. That's a nonprofit
that helps those in need.

50
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,203
Why would Fuerza be there?

51
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:33,131
So as you can see, Your Honor,
my client has already demonstrated

52
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:38,594
that despite her past mistakes
Frost now only wishes to serve this city

53
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,848
alongside our greatest protector,
the Flash.

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,144
Still, she's aware
that justice must be served,

55
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,355
which is why she's seeking
a fair punishment,

56
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,233
not only because it's
the right thing to do,

57
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,529
but to prove once and for all
who she really is.

58
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,324
She's a flawed person,

59
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:04,537
who has changed her ways
and become a hero in her own right.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,873
Well argued, Ms. Horton.

61
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,334
Counselor Strong, would the State
like to make an opening remark?

62
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,214
By her own admission,

63
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,551
the meta-human known
as Killer Frost is guilty of crimes

64
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,095
that have endangered
the peace of our city

65
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,181
and the safety of our citizens.

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,808
And the State finds it absurd that

67
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,936
a former DA would romanticize
this narrative to avoid punishment.

68
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,149
It's early, and I haven't
had my coffee, Counselor,

69
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,027
but I don't believe the defendant
is asking to avoid punishment.

70
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,823
Agreed, Your Honor.
But the State has one goal.

71
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,911
To ensure that this
extremely dangerous criminal

72
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,246
no longer threatens our good citizens.

73
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:52,668
Which is why we believe
she must have her powers erased.

74
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,382
Your Honor, that is highly irregular.

75
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,302
I'll decide that, Ms. Horton.
Ms. Strong, please continue.

76
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,723
In lieu of prison, the State moves
to submit alternate punishment.

77
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:09,268
That Killer Frost
be compelled by this court...

78
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,772
to take the meta-human cure.

79
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,288
Kramer is damn good.

80
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,582
We're here looking
for a lighter sentence.

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,503
She's arguing that since felons
are prohibited from owning firearms,

82
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,755
Frost's powers are weapons

83
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,091
that the State can take away
using the cure.

84
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,302
A cure that C.C.P.D. only has
'cause we gave it to them.

85
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,513
A cure that's supposed to be voluntary.

86
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,890
How can Kramer just force Frost
to take it like that?

87
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,391
Is that even legal?

88
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,769
Yeah. You would be surprised
what can become legal

89
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:52,913
when you've got the full force

90
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,577
of the American justice system
behind you.

91
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,566
It can be pretty scary sometimes.

92
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,903
What if we forget the deal?
Just take the ten to twenty years.

93
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,614
Prosecution's not even
seeking jail time anymore.

94
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:07,577
Kramer is all about the cure.
She wants Frost neutralized forever.

95
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,747
At least it can't get any worse.

96
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,790
Actually, it can. I just spoke to Mom.

97
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,043
She's gonna run some more tests
to be sure, but we think that because

98
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:21,257
you are uniquely born from meta DNA,
if you take the cure, it could harm you.

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,801
- Maybe even kill you.
- This is insane.

100
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,053
Okay, no one is touching Frost.

101
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,222
- We're gonna stop this, right?
- Hell, yeah.

102
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,391
Okay. We need to fight fire with fire.

103
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,060
Hack Kramer, dig up dirt.
Whatever it takes to save Frost.

104
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,608
No. I didn't just turn myself in so
that I could go and break the law again.

105
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,153
We're doing this by the book
or not at all. Okay, Caity?

106
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,951
- Okay. You're right.
- Something still doesn't sit right.

107
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,039
Why would Kramer go so hard
to take you down?

108
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:54,998
I have no idea.

109
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,586
But all I care about now
is stopping her.

110
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,963
Well, we do that by convincing the judge

111
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,507
that you deserve prison time
and not the cure.

112
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,445
I've got some case law books back
at the office that we need to look at.

113
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,848
And, Joe, I think you can help me out.

114
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,903
- Okay. What are we really doing?
- I like your hacking idea.

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,822
We need to think bigger.
Frost's life is on the line.

116
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,453
Guys, I'm still picking up
Fuerza's isotopic signature in the area.

117
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,705
<i>- You still don't see her?</i>
- No, nothing yet.

118
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,793
Fuerza's signature is seismic-based.

119
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,463
Maybe she hides underground.

120
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,050
There's a lot of people here.

121
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,512
We should run them all away,
before things get dangerous.

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,557
No. The Forces want
to feed off our powers, Barry.

123
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,538
That's probably why this thing
attacked you in the first place.

124
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,105
Using our abilities too early,

125
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,358
even if it's to save others,
could put them in danger.

126
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,902
Yeah, I guess that is possible.

127
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,822
There's still so much we don't know
about these Forces.

128
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,409
We know all we need to.
They're dangerous.

129
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,539
I still remember how they attacked me.
Eating me alive.

130
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,126
I could feel it. It's pure evil.

131
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,712
I know. I felt it too
when Psych attacked me.

132
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,257
Wherever these things came from,
they have to be stopped.

133
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,301
- <i>Yeah, I'm not so sure.</i>
- What do you mean?

134
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:33,180
Well, the Sage Force is clearly
dangerous, and Fuerza too,

135
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,932
but do you remember
what Chester and Cisco

136
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,600
said about Deon, the Still Force?

137
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,020
That he was just a kid
who wanted to be left alone.

138
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,106
Yeah. I mean, does that seem like
a vicious energy feeder to you?

139
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,899
<i>Something doesn't add up here.</i>

140
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,066
Barry, the creature that we're hunting
killed someone and tried to kill you.

141
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:51,490
We can't let ourselves be fooled by the
human facades these Forces hide behind.

142
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,494
Underneath them,
these Forces have only one goal.

143
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,331
To destroy everything they touch.
You need to remember that.

144
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,687
<i>Barry,
we've got another hit,</i>

145
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,212
<i>and it's coming from the next tent.</i>

146
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,523
Great. Just put those
extra rations just over...

147
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,943
Wait. Are you two volunteers?

148
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,946
Uh, no, we're...

149
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,075
- No, actually.
- No? Oh.

150
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,702
Sorry. It's been a pretty busy morning.

151
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,165
I'm Alexa Rivera,
the field supervisor for Keystone Cares.

152
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,373
What can I do for you?

153
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,300
<i>Mic check.
One, two, one, two.</i>

154
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,762
<i>- You ready?</i>
- I sure hope so.

155
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,602
Officer Korber? I'm Caitlin Snow.
I was detained here the other day.

156
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,521
- It was a misunderstanding,
- Right. I heard.

157
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,096
- Sorry that happened.
- It's okay. It's all sorted now.

158
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,819
But when they released me,
they didn't return all of my belongings.

159
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,361
Really?

160
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,573
Yes. I'm still missing
a necklace and a bracelet.

161
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:18,119
- The bracelet used to be my mother's.
- I'm sure they're still in lockup.

162
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,245
Mm.

163
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,915
If you just want to fill out a 10-67
for loss of property, I'll get them.

164
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:28,837
Great.

165
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,257
Cisco, is the coast clear?

166
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,511
I am back-looping
the security cameras now.

167
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,020
<i>You've got two minutes
before they're back up.</i>

168
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,475
Which way am I going again?

169
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,603
This whole breaking into C.C.P.D. thing
is freaking me out.

170
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,023
When we gave them the cure,
they stored the surplus in the armory.

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,275
<i>That's where you're headed.</i>

172
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,278
- Uh...
<i>- Just turn right.</i>

173
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,655
<i>Your other right.</i>

174
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,493
All right. You're gonna attach
the inertial oximeter to the door.

175
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:03,455
It's gonna send out a pulse that will
neutralize all cure samples on site.

176
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,458
Almost there.

177
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,002
Can I help you?

178
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,722
You seem lost.

179
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,101
I'm from <i>The Citizen.</i>
I'm here for our interview.

180
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,513
Caitlin, Allegra needs backup.
Kramer's got her pinned.

181
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,193
Sorry about that.

182
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:46,624
- No one told me about any interview.
- They had to. I contacted your office.

183
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,668
They said you were
in charge of meta affairs.

184
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,464
- And clearly you were never told.
- No, I wasn't.

185
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,844
Okay, look, this is a huge scoop for me.
Could you just give me ten minutes?

186
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,285
How much time do I have left before
the cameras turn back on?

187
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,270
Twenty seconds. We have to deliver
the oximeter now or we're screwed.

188
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,983
Please. If I go back empty-handed,
my boss is gonna kill me.

189
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,694
Ten minutes. That's all I'm asking.

190
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,205
- You've got five.
- Thanks. Let's go sit.

191
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,257
Whoa. You should really
get that checked out.

192
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,343
Yeah. I'll have someone
take a look at it.

193
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,098
Ten seconds. Go, go, go, go, go.

194
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,026
The cure has been neutralized.

195
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,862
<i>Now get the hell out of there
before I have a heart attack.</i>

196
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,002
Wait. So am I under arrest?

197
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,881
No, no, no, no, no.
I am with C.C.P.D. but I'm a CSI.

198
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,093
- I don't arrest people.
- But you think I'm guilty of something.

199
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:27,474
Great. I'm never gonna
catch a break, am I?

200
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,307
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

201
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,479
Okay, fine. Yeah, it's true.
I was an addict.

202
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,566
Then I hit rock bottom
and that was a wakeup call.

203
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:40,029
So I got clean. I went to school.
I could have worked in a hospital.

204
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,655
But this is where I belong,

205
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,700
helping people just like me
turn their lives around.

206
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,597
Look, I've been to rehab,
and I don't have a record,

207
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,261
so whatever crime you're investigating...

208
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,793
No, no. It's nothing like that. We...

209
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,464
Um...

210
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,717
It's gonna sound kind of crazy,

211
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,762
but we've been scanning
the city for a new meta,

212
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:09,183
and for some reason,
our readings led us to you.

213
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,896
Seriously? I'm not a meta.

214
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,066
We're not so sure.

215
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,257
Well, then what do you want from me?

216
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,573
Alexa, we'd like for you
to come to S.T.A.R. Labs with us.

217
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,949
We work with a team there

218
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,743
that can conduct a simple,
painless test.

219
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,119
Tell us what we already know.

220
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,123
That you're the monster
who attacked Central City

221
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,040
and killed a man,
and tried to kill me too.

222
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,043
I have never
seen you before in my life.

223
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,562
And I'm not going anywhere with you.

224
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,338
Especially not S.T.A.R. Labs.

225
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,548
Yeah, I've heard of them.

226
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,902
They're the ones that started
all this meta stuff in the first place.

227
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,387
- Alexa, hold on. We just want to help.
- No, you hold on.

228
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,639
I am not a monster.

229
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,560
And if you don't mind, there are people
who actually need my help.

230
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,313
Please don't contact me again.

231
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,842
I don't see why you're so upset.

232
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,969
We know that woman is the thing
we've been searching for.

233
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,578
No. We think she might be.

234
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,474
But now we'll never learn the truth
because you scared her away.

235
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,043
Barry, the answer is simple.
If she won't come to us, we'll make her.

236
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,838
- What?
- We move in the blink of an eye.

237
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,117
She'll never know.
And by the time she does we'll test her.

238
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:27,719
And if she's innocent, return her
before she takes her next breath.

239
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,930
Nora, I know you're new to all of this,

240
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,325
but we don't just grab people
and test them against their will.

241
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,392
- Why not?
- Because...

242
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,370
- Lives are at stake.
- That's not how this works.

243
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,520
Well, maybe it should.

244
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,523
Barry, you and I know
what this thing is really capable of.

245
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,942
Now all I'm asking is for you
to trust me

246
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,227
and do what needs to be done.

247
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,338
Is that really too much for me to ask?

248
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,762
You're asking him to give up
a part of what makes him a hero.

249
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,159
So yes, Nora, it is too much.

250
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,457
Barry... it's your choice.

251
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,048
<i>Captain West.</i>

252
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,635
You're here to make
a statement on behalf

253
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,721
of the defendant. If you please...

254
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,976
I admit under oath that Frost

255
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,061
hasn't always been
on the right side of the law.

256
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:23,567
But I can also say that she has
put her life on the line

257
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,737
countless times to save others.

258
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,405
How so, Captain?

259
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,452
Frost has fought alongside Earth's
greatest heroes to save the world,

260
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,289
which means that she's saved
every person in this room,

261
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:42,002
including those who want to lock her up
for being who she was,

262
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,797
not for who she is today.

263
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,094
And, Your Honor...

264
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,350
I don't understand how this court

265
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,104
can force Frost to take that cure

266
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,191
without sacrificing what it stands for.

267
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,109
Justice.

268
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,035
Thank you, Captain West.
Your word goes a long way in this court.

269
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,121
Thank you.

270
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,919
In fact, I believe I'm ready
to deliver my verdict.

271
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,509
Your Honor, we have a new update
regarding a relevant incident

272
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,554
that could affect your ruling.
If it pleases the court...

273
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,429
Proceed.

274
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,849
Earlier today,
the meta-human cure supply

275
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,977
at C.C.P.D. was rendered inert.

276
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,938
It is now completely unusable.

277
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,941
The State suspects foul play

278
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,735
by the only person with motive
for such bold treachery.

279
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,071
- Killer Frost.
- No, I didn't do it.

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,699
It wasn't me.
I have not been to C.C.P.D.

281
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,744
- I have been here.
- Let me handle this, please.

282
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,537
Objection. Your Honor,
this is speculative nonsense.

283
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:03,041
Sustained. Prosecutor, do you have
evidence for your accusations?

284
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,125
Yes, Your Honor.

285
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:09,464
C.C.P.D. security cameras were hacked at
the exact moment the cure was destroyed.

286
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,442
We wouldn't have found out
if not for Ms. Kramer's

287
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,427
expertise in military intelligence.

288
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,554
She uncovered the hack herself.

289
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,813
It was me, Your Honor.
I did it. Not Frost.

290
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
- And I acted alone.
- She's lying, Your Honor.

291
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,067
Killer Frost is clearly
behind this crime

292
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,591
because her criminal past
is the same as her criminal present.

293
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,489
- I am not a criminal.
- Order.

294
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,866
I did it. I told you.

295
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,161
- I said order.
- Everybody, sit down.

296
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,709
Now, Ms. Strong, considering the cure
isn't a viable option,

297
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,338
can the court assume the State
is no longer seeking it as a punishment?

298
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,797
On the contrary...

299
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,430
And where exactly did you get that?

300
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,641
My colleague Ms. Kramer
knows the magnitude

301
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,559
of the meta criminal
we are dealing with.

302
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,062
So she contacted A.R.G.U.S.
on behalf of the State

303
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,066
and had them replicate the cure
based on C.C.P.D. samples.

304
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,860
We should have 100 vials
ready by nightfall.

305
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,655
All we need is your decision,
Your Honor.

306
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,531
Very well.

307
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,744
I'll retire to my chambers
and make my decision.

308
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,373
- Court is adjourned.
- All rise.

309
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,926
This is for your own good.

310
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,556
What just happened?

311
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,810
We just lost.

312
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,241
Babe, please tell us
you know a way out of this.

313
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,121
I'm sorry,

314
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,543
but I don't know.

315
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,586
I don't know how we're gonna keep Frost
from being forced to take the cure.

316
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,506
What's Kramer's deal anyway?

317
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,842
Kramer's had it out for me
since before I was arrested.

318
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,136
My gut tells me
she's still hiding something.

319
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,096
We need a miracle. And fast.

320
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,056
No, we don't, because we are Team Flash,

321
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,517
and we have more than enough resources
to figure this out.

322
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,519
Caitlin, we already
went that route, remember?

323
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:28,996
And all we did was make things worse.

324
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,356
Okay, well, I can't just sit here
and do nothing, okay?

325
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,943
Because Frost is my sister, and I have
to do everything I can to protect her.

326
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,282
Guys, I need to talk to Caitlin.
Alone.

327
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,595
You want to explain yourself?
Caity, you made me a promise

328
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,014
that we would fight this
the way I wanted to.

329
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,808
Okay, but that's the thing. Okay?
You are not fighting this.

330
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,186
You skipped your trial
and look how that turned out.

331
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,479
And whose fault is that?

332
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,526
It's Mom.

333
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,447
She got the test results back from
how the cure will affect your meta DNA.

334
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,784
Thank God. She says you'll be fine.

335
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,412
The cure will take away your powers,
but it won't harm you.

336
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,663
You're gonna survive.

337
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,123
Great. Whatever.

338
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,961
Frost, this is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

339
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,965
- This is gonna save you.
- By erasing my powers?

340
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,967
You heard Cecile, okay?

341
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,554
Even if we can convince the judge
to give you prison time,

342
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,943
you're looking at
ten to twenty years easy.

343
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,973
Then I'll take it.

344
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,770
Why would you give up
two decades of your life

345
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,064
when there is a perfectly safe solution?

346
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,777
Changing who I am is not a solution.
How the hell can you even ask me that?

347
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,672
You're the one who said
the cure should always be a choice.

348
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,490
Then why won't you choose this?

349
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,850
Do you remember when
the Sage force attacked

350
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,459
and I told you my greatest fear?

351
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,921
It's living life without you.

352
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:24,386
I am terrified of living a life
that you're not in.

353
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:30,600
Frost, you are my sister.
I love you. And I cannot lose you.

354
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,856
And if I take the cure, you will.

355
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,191
Caity, don't you see?

356
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:44,030
It's not me you're trying to protect.
It's yourself.

357
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,176
The Flash.

358
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,141
That CSI sent you, didn't he?

359
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:16,605
Alexa, I know everything you've heard
today probably sounds insane,

360
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,398
let alone terrifying.

361
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,692
But if you give me a chance,

362
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,821
I think maybe I can explain
why it's so important you get tested.

363
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,366
I already know why.

364
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,926
You were there
when Fuerza attacked Central City.

365
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,141
I was part of a team building
low-income housing that week,

366
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,605
and I just remember feeling so angry

367
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,815
when Abra Kadabra
destroyed our worksite.

368
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,196
I don't remember much else.

369
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,454
I've been having blackouts.

370
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,832
Just waking up in strange places

371
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:23,254
not knowing where I've been
or what I've done.

372
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,633
When was the last time it happened?

373
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,302
When this thing attacked.

374
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,392
What if... Oh, my God.
What if I am this monster?

375
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,896
Help me find out. Trust me.

376
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,608
I know how scary it is
to not have full control of yourself.

377
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,738
I haven't felt this way
since before I got clean.

378
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,201
I don't know if I'm strong enough
to know the truth.

379
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,623
I just feel so weak.

380
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:12,387
Alexa, the person who received
these cards is not a monster.

381
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,058
You've dedicated your life
to selflessly helping those in need.

382
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,895
Finding out the truth about yourself,
it's the same thing.

383
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,190
You'll be keeping people safe.

384
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,532
I don't know why...

385
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,703
but I feel like I can trust you.

386
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:50,467
All right, Captain West,
let's finish reviewing this so we can...

387
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,764
Joe arranged a little meet cute for us.

388
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,480
You and Captain West seem awfully close.

389
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,066
- I wonder why that is.
- We're poker buddies.

390
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,486
- What do you want?
- To know why you hate me.

391
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,822
Did I hurt you or someone you love?

392
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,576
Then why do you want
to take my powers away?

393
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,037
How is that justice?

394
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,290
You've got a lot of gall
lecturing me about justice.

395
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,877
You only turned yourself in
after years of evading the law

396
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,213
when you were surrounded by my officers.

397
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:32,217
That's not doing the right thing.
That's called getting caught.

398
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,511
Look, I'll go to prison,
do my time. Fine.

399
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:39,015
But forcing the cure on me?
I don't deserve that.

400
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,059
The court will decide what you deserve.

401
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,316
This isn't just about what you've done.
This is about what people like you do.

402
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:54,739
Right. So you hate all metas.
Very original. Cicada with a badge.

403
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:59,410
I don't hate all meta-humans.
Just the ones who pretend to be heroes.

404
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:05,750
I lost an entire platoon
because I made that mistake.

405
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,626
On my orders,

406
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,172
they followed a meta
I thought was a hero into a hot zone.

407
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,715
But he fooled me.

408
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,762
By the time I realized his betrayal,
20 soldiers lost their lives,

409
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,598
lives I was responsible to protect.
Never again.

410
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,227
This isn't just about me.

411
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,440
You want to go after all meta-humans.

412
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,777
Only the criminals.

413
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,536
But your sentence will set
the legal precedent.

414
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:42,162
First you take the cure.
Then any meta who endangers

415
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,247
the good of the people
will have to follow suit.

416
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,417
You cannot be serious.

417
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,336
I admire your fight.

418
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,382
But there is nothing
you can do to stop this,

419
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,261
'cause in the end, justice always wins.

420
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:20,158
You know, this whole waiting
for a verdict thing, it sucks.

421
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:25,747
Frost, I am so sorry. You're right.
I wasn't thinking about what you wanted.

422
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,141
I was only thinking about what I wanted.

423
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,249
It doesn't matter.

424
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,962
Kramer's gonna win and every meta in
the city is gonna lose because of me.

425
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,660
Kramer's trying to set a precedent

426
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:43,056
that any meta accused of a crime
can be punished with the cure.

427
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,894
I was just thinking about
all the meta lives that will hurt.

428
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:53,316
I don't even care about myself anymore.
I just want to help them.

429
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,448
Hey.

430
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,246
Aren't you supposed to be the one
telling me not to worry?

431
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,748
That we'll figure it out.

432
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,711
That's the thing, sis.
I think I just did.

433
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:33,356
Okay. This place is even
more intimidating on the inside.

434
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,527
Alexa, I know you're nervous,
but the Flash promised to keep you safe,

435
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,879
and we're gonna keep that promise.

436
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:43,533
Barry's right. And I'm sorry if
I startled you earlier, but don't worry.

437
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,285
Something goes wrong,

438
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,912
I'm sure the Flash will show up
and take care of everything.

439
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,125
Come with me. Speed Lab's this way.

440
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:01,259
It's been quite the long day,
but before I render my verdict,

441
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,623
I understand the defendant
would like to make a statement.

442
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,347
You ready for this?

443
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,115
Here's the deal.

444
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:29,245
Taking away a meta-human's powers
isn't the same thing

445
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,331
as taking away a gun from a criminal.

446
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,959
Erasing our powers
is erasing our identity.

447
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:40,131
It's saying, "Hey, you were made bad.
Change that."

448
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:46,095
But shouldn't justice be about
changing the way a person acts,

449
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,347
not the way they were born?

450
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,936
I get it.
You fear us because we're different.

451
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:57,023
You'd feel safer if we were the same.

452
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,443
But different can't be cured.

453
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,448
It's here to stay. We're here to stay.

454
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,748
Some of you only think of me
as the criminal I used to be.

455
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,586
Back then, I was only interested
in protecting myself.

456
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,509
But then, I found someone else
worth protecting.

457
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:29,555
And protecting that person led me
to protecting the whole city.

458
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,892
And slowly I changed.

459
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:41,192
I learned how to be selfless
instead of selfish.

460
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:48,074
I learned that I'm my best self
when I am protecting other people.

461
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,833
So with the help of someone close to me,

462
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,292
I've made a decision.

463
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,839
It's okay.

464
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:18,896
I am submitting a request
for life in prison without parole.

465
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:31,701
Your Honor, prison time is not
the punishment the State is requesting.

466
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,661
Correction, Your Honor.

467
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:38,416
The State's own words made very clear
that their only goal was,

468
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:42,628
and I quote, "to ensure this
extremely dangerous criminal

469
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,465
no longer threatens our good citizens."

470
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,259
Are those your words, Counselor?

471
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,096
Yes, Your Honor.

472
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:57,226
Then I'll remind Ms. Kramer she isn't
counsel and kindly ask her to sit down.

473
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,618
The court would like
to ask the defendant

474
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,495
if she's fully aware
of what she's proposing.

475
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,248
Yes, I am.

476
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,461
As am I that my judgement
will set a precedent.

477
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,798
A ruling for the cure
sets it as a viable punishment.

478
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,468
A ruling against it
takes it off the table.

479
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:35,640
Like my old law professor used to say,
in order for justice to be blind,

480
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,519
sometimes she must open her eyes
to ugly truths.

481
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:44,065
Therefore, I hereby sentence

482
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,318
the meta-human criminal
known as Frost...

483
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,740
to life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

484
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,103
Captain, I'm all packed up.

485
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,188
Just thought I'd say goodbye.

486
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,650
Good luck.

487
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:41,163
Listen, I know
we've had our differences,

488
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,957
and maybe that's an understatement,

489
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:49,422
especially after today,
but I just wanted to tell you,

490
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:54,051
despite our personal frictions,
you have my respect.

491
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,139
I admire your commitment to justice.

492
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,352
The feeling's mutual.

493
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,649
Truth is, I may not always
like your methods.

494
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,401
Sometimes I downright despise them.

495
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,572
But I know a good cop when I see one.

496
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,285
- Only that's not all, is it?
- No.

497
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:26,417
Make sure you're always checking
which side of the line you're on.

498
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,480
Hm.

499
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,525
<i>Hush now</i>

500
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,989
<i>Don't explain</i>

501
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,956
<i>There ain't nothin' to gain</i>

502
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:16,175
<i>I'm glad that you're back</i>

503
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,722
<i>Don't explain</i>

504
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,785
<i>All my thoughts are of you</i>

505
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:48,749
<i>For I'm so completely yours</i>

506
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:54,171
<i>I don't want to hear nobody chatter</i>

507
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,341
<i>'Cause I know you cheat</i>

508
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,344
Every meta in town
will know what you did for us.

509
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:04,056
<i>Right and wrong don't matter</i>

510
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,061
<i>When you're with me, my sweet</i>

511
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:15,151
<i>Hush now</i>

512
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,570
<i>Don't explain</i>

513
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,703
<i>You're myjoy</i>

514
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,122
<i>You're my pain</i>

515
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,297
<i>My life</i>

516
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,800
<i>Is yours, love</i>

517
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:44,847
<i>Don't explain</i>

518
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,856
So I just lie here?

519
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:59,028
Yeah. These arc radiators
emit isotopic energy.

520
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,532
I'll be using this tablet to gradually
expose you to those same isotopic waves.

521
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:10,289
- Are you okay?
- No. I'm scared out of my mind.

522
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,875
You're gonna be fine. I promise.

523
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:17,004
So if you're right about all this,
won't I change?

524
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,899
'Cause if that happens,
I could hurt someone...

525
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:22,218
You won't hurt anyone.
We're only administering a tiny dose.

526
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,316
Just enough to trigger
the smallest change

527
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,013
inside you on a microscopic level.

528
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,184
So if something is inside you,
our instruments will tell us.

529
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,624
Are you still sure you want to do this?

530
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,614
- Ready?
- Yeah. Her baseline is steady.

531
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,756
- What is it?
- Nothing.

532
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,760
Just the way you inspired Barry
to reach out to Alexa.

533
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,763
You really are his lightning rod.

534
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,696
Alexa, can you hear me?

535
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,291
Get away from...

536
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:47,219
Alexa, can you hear me?

537
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,519
- Hey, it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

538
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,314
I am that thing.
What am I gonna do?

539
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,938
You're gonna be all right. You're gonna
be all right. Okay? You're safe here.

540
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,571
We're gonna help you deal with this.
I promise.

541
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,257
- Nora?
- You still don't get it.

542
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,800
If I don't end her now,

543
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,802
she'll sacrifice me
to get what she wants.

544
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,055
- My life.
- Wait. Listen to me.

545
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,016
I know you're scared.
We can still help her.

546
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:38,604
You should be helping me. I need your
powers to defeat her, and you promised.

547
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,400
But now you're breaking that promise
and I know why.

548
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:49,782
You may be his lightning rod...
but I'm the lightning.

549
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,480
Thank you.

550
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,675
Time to choose a side, Barry.
