1
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,200
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,240
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
The honour of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,720
Get the girls settled in.
l'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,320
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,800
lf you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,840
(Doors creaking)

8
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,760
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

9
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,800
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

10
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

11
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,600
Sturdy old thing.

12
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,960
How many kings' arses
have polished it, l wonder?

13
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
Um, what's the line?

14
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,000
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

15
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Very handsome armour.

16
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,600
- Not a scratch on it.
- l know.

17
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,120
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

18
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,800
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
l have a knack for it.

20
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,920
lt must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

21
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,960
l was standing right here
when it happened.

22
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,920
He was very brave, your brother.

23
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,760
Your father, too.

24
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,800
They didn't deserve to die like that.

25
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,600
Nobody deserves to die like that.

26
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,480
But you just stood there and watched.

27
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,400
500 men just stood there and watched.

28
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,040
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

29
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,400
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,920
No, Lord Stark.

31
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,960
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

32
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,000
Except for the screams, of course,

33
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,000
and the Mad King laughing.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,640
And later...

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,160
when l watched the Mad King die,

36
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,440
l remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

37
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,320
lt felt like justice.

38
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,720
ls that what you tell yourself at night?

39
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,480
You're a servant ofjustice?

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,880
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,560
Tell me, if l'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

42
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
would you admire me more?

43
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,320
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

44
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,880
Lord Stark.

45
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,640
Lord Varys.

46
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,320
l was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

47
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,920
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

48
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,120
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

49
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,360
Renly! You're looking well.

50
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
And you look tired from the road.

51
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,320
l told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

52
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,000
(Man) But we have a kingdom
to look after.

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,080
l've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

54
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,520
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

55
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
l understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

56
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,680
All too well.
l still carry a token of his esteem...

57
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
from navel to collarbone.

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

59
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,520
lt wasn't the man that l chose, my lord.

60
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,840
lt was Catelyn Tully.

61
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,040
A woman worth fighting for,
l'm sure you'll agree.

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,640
l humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,160
Grand Maester.

64
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,440
How many years has it been?

65
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,880
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Oh, how forgetful of me.

67
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,920
This belongs to you now.

68
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,200
Should we begin?

69
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,120
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
but l'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

71
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,440
(Varys) His Grace has many cares.

72
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,000
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

73
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
We are the lords of small matters here.

74
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,440
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

75
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

76
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,360
- Mm, how much?
- 40,OOO gold dragons to the champion,

77
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,960
20,OOO to the runner-up,

78
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,000
20,OOO to the winning archer.

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,320
Can the treasury bear such expense?

80
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,160
l'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, l expect.

81
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,320
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,OOO?

82
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,120
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

83
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,920
- l'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,480
l will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

86
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,280
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

87
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,960
but l fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

88
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,440
''Counting coppers,'' he calls it.

89
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,240
l'll speak to him tomorrow.

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,480
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot amord.

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,920
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,800
There will be no plans...
until l speak to Robert.

93
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,560
Forgive me, my lords. l'm...

94
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,880
- l had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
We serve at your pleasure.

96
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,080
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,800
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

98
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,480
You fought om a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

99
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,120
l'm not like him. l didn't fight om anything.
It bit me and all l did was scream.

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,760
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

101
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,760
That's not true. You killed the beast.

102
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,920
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

103
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,320
l didn't, l...

104
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,920
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

106
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,800
Do l have to marry her?

107
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes.

108
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,800
She's very beautiful and young.

109
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,000
lf you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

110
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,280
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

111
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,120
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,680
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

113
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,760
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

114
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

115
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,280
- l don't want to.
- No, but you will.

116
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,040
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

117
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,560
We allow the northerners too much power.

118
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,960
They consider themselves our equals.

119
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,560
How would you handle them?

120
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,080
l'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,OOO men to the royal army.

121
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
A royal army?

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,200
Why should every lord
command his own men?

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,400
lt's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

125
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,160
trained by experienced soldiers,

126
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
And if the northerners rebel?

128
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
l'd crush them.

129
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,800
Seize Winterfell and install someone
Ioyal to the realm as warden of the North.

130
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,200
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

131
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,840
And these 10,OOO northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

132
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,040
- For me. l'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

133
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,040
But you've just invaded their homeland,

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,760
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- l'm not asking.

135
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,680
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

136
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,720
lt's too big and too wild.

137
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,320
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

138
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,480
couldn't save you and your royal army.

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

140
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,160
and when to destroy his enemies.

141
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,760
So you agree...

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
the Starks are enemies?

143
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,640
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

145
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,160
- l'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

146
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,120
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

147
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
The Hound killed your friend.

149
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

150
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,400
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

151
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,640
Mycah would be alive.

152
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,080
Enough!

153
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,200
What's happening here?

154
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,440
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

155
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,320
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

156
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,480
That's for you, love.

157
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,120
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

158
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,440
Don't you like it?

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,960
l haven't played with dolls since l was eight.

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,320
- May l be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

161
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
lt's all right. Go on.

162
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,280
War was easier than daughters.

163
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,120
- (Knock on door)
- Go away!

164
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,600
(Ned) Arya, open the door.

165
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,320
May l come in?

166
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,160
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

167
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,880
Give it to me.

168
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
l know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

169
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
Where did you get this?

170
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,760
This is no toy.

171
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,400
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- l wasn't playing.

172
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,360
And l don't want to be a lady.

173
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
Come here.

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,840
Now what do you want with this?

175
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,200
lt's called Needle.

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,280
Oh, a blade with a name.

177
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,800
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

178
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,800
Your sister?

179
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,080
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

180
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,880
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,680
(Laughs) That's the essence of it.

182
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,480
l was trying to learn.

183
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,800
l asked Mycah to practice with me.

184
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,160
l asked him. It was my fault.

185
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,240
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

186
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,600
l hate them. l hate all of them.

187
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
The Hound, the queen and the king

188
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
and Joffrey and Sansa.

189
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,120
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

190
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,600
and asked to call the prince a liar.

191
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,120
So was l! He is a liar.

192
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,160
Shh, darling, listen to me.

193
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

194
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
She cannot betray him.

195
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,400
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,200
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

197
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Well...

198
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,800
Look at me.

199
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,920
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

200
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,400
Winter is coming.

201
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,360
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

202
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,720
But now winter is truly coming.

203
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,640
And in the winter
we must protect ourselves,

204
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,040
look after one another.

205
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,360
Sansa is your sister.

206
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,680
l don't hate her.

207
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,640
Not really.

208
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,600
l don't want to frighten you,
but l won't lie to you either.

209
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,040
We've come to a dangerous place.

210
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,360
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

211
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
All right?

212
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,440
Go on. It's yours.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
l can keep it?

214
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,320
Try not to stab your sister with it.

215
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
(Chuckles)

216
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,680
lf you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

217
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,120
(Door opens, closes)

218
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,680
(Cawing)

219
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

220
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,600
- l know a story about a crow.
- l hate your stories.

221
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
l know a story about a boy who hated stories.

222
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,240
l could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

223
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,160
Those were always your favourites.

224
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,440
Those weren't my favourites.

225
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,960
My favourites were the scary ones.

226
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,320
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

227
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,520
I
Fear is for the winter

228
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,720
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

229
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,080
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,960
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

231
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,560
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

232
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,720
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

233
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,160
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

234
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,000
Kings froze to death in their castles,

235
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,160
same as the shepherds in their huts.

236
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,800
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

237
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,040
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

238
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,520
So is this the sort of story that you like?

239
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,960
ln that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

240
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,960
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

241
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
riding their dead horses,

242
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,840
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

243
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,040
(Door rattles)

244
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,960
What are you telling him now?

245
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,280
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

246
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,880
Get your supper. l want some time with him.

247
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,280
- (Door closes)
- One time she told me

248
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,480
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

249
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,240
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

250
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,360
Maybe we do.

251
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,680
How do you feel?

252
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
You still don't remember anything?

253
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,080
Bran, l've seen you climb
a thousand times.

254
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,920
ln the wind, in the rain...

255
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,000
A thousand times.

256
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,240
- You never fall.
- l did though.

257
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
lt's true, isn't it,

258
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,520
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

259
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,560
l'd rather be dead.

260
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,920
- Don't ever say that.
- l'd rather be dead.

261
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,600
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

262
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,680
But still too many.

263
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,240
lt's nine years since l've set foot
in the capital.

264
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,440
And no one knew who l was
the last time l came, either.

265
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,280
My lady.

266
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,400
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

267
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,240
l would. We've done nothing wrong.

268
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,440
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

269
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,200
lnstructed?

270
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,840
l don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

271
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,520
Follow me, Lady Stark.

272
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Cat!

273
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,400
Go on. Go upstairs.

274
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,120
You little worm!

275
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

276
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Pssst!

277
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,840
l meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

278
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,760
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

279
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,240
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

280
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,720
l'm truly sorry...about the locale.

281
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,000
How did you know l was
coming to King's Landing?

282
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,920
A dear friend told me.

283
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,320
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

284
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,240
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

285
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,640
Your poor hands.

286
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,560
How did you know l was coming?

287
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

288
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,080
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

289
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,880
My little birds are everywhere...

290
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,040
even in the North.

291
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

292
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Valyrian steel.

293
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,360
Do you know whose dagger this is?

294
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,880
l must admit l do not.

295
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,320
Well, well, this is an historic day.

296
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,480
Something you don't know that l do.

297
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,440
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

298
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
- It's mine.
- Yours?

299
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,520
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

300
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
l bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

301
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,200
as any sane man would.

302
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,080
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
l lost this dagger.

303
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
To whom?

304
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,160
Tyrion Lannister.

305
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,400
The Imp.

306
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,000
(Man) Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

307
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,040
(Grunting)

308
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,920
lf that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

309
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,440
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

310
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,400
Pyp.

311
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,320
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

312
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,520
(Shouts)

313
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,000
(Coughs)

314
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,880
Next!

315
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,160
(Grunting)

316
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,600
Next!

317
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,600
(Grunting)

318
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,200
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

319
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,360
Go clean yourselves up!

320
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,120
There's only so much
l can stomach in a day.

321
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,520
A charming man.

322
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,000
l don't need him to be charming.

323
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,040
l need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

324
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,520
into men of the Night's Watch.

325
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,840
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

326
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
Slowly.

327
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,720
A raven came...for Ned Stark's son.

328
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,840
Good news or bad?

329
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
Both.

330
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,880
(Maester Pycelle) Lord Stark.

331
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,680
(Wheezing) l meant...
to give you this earlier.

332
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,800
So forgetful these days.

333
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,240
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

334
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,640
Good news?

335
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,360
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

336
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,280
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

337
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
(Woman) Yes, l'm looking at you.

338
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,920
(Laughter)

339
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,320
l thought that she'd be safest in here.

340
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
One of several such
establishments l own.

341
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,760
You're a funny man.

342
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Huh? A very funny man.

343
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,520
Ned!

344
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,680
Ah, the Starks...

345
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,520
Quick tempers, slow minds.

346
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,920
You broke my nose, bastard!

347
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,920
lt's an improvement.

348
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,760
lf we threw you over the Wall,
l wonder how long it would take you to hit.

349
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,040
l wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

350
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,400
(Door opens)

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,560
What are you looking at, halfman?

352
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,120
l'm looking at you.

353
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

354
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,160
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

355
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,800
All of you.

356
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,960
And what do you care about our faces?

357
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,760
lt's just...

358
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,680
l think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

359
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
Perhaps l'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

360
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,000
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

361
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,840
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

362
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,240
No one but you.

363
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,720
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

364
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,840
Grenn's father left him too...

365
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

366
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,880
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,120
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

368
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

369
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,600
l've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

370
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,520
They hate me because
l'm better than they are.

371
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,840
lt's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

372
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,320
l don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

373
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,360
before they came here.

374
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,400
Oh...

375
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,480
Your brother Bran.

376
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
He's woken up.

377
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,720
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

378
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,000
would be considered treason.

379
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,240
We have proof. We have the blade.

380
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,280
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

381
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,760
The only man who could say otheM/ise
has no throat,

382
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
thanks to your boy's wolf.

383
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,800
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

384
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,040
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

385
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,520
l'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

386
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,280
A fool's task, admittedly,

387
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,840
but l've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

388
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,920
l won't forget this.

389
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,000
You're a true friend.

390
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,120
Don't tell anyone.
l have a reputation to maintain.

391
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
(Knock on door)

392
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,520
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

393
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,320
He's a child. Ten years old.

394
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
- What were you thinking?
- l was thinking of us.

395
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:24,160
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

396
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,920
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

397
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,000
Then what are you raving about?

398
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,400
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

399
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,680
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

400
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,480
We'll say whatever we like.
l think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

401
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,560
- And my husband?
- l'll go to war with him if l have to.

402
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,200
They can write a ballad about us -

403
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,920
''The War For Cersei's Cunt.''

404
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
(Laughs)

405
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,160
- Let me go.
- Never.

406
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,880
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

407
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,840
And if he does, l'll kill him.

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,160
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

409
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,560
until you and l are the only people
Ieft in this world.

410
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
l wish l could see the girls.

411
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,200
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

412
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,360
Until we know who our enemies are.

413
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
l know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

414
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,400
ln my bones, l know it.

415
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,320
Littlefinger's right.

416
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
l can't do anything without proof.

417
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,640
And if you find the proof?

418
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,680
Then l bring it to Robert...

419
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,360
and hope he's still the man l once knew.

420
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,120
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

421
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,400
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

422
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,960
My temper? (Chuckles)

423
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,800
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

424
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,160
He still loves you.

425
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,960
Does he?

426
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,400
Om with you.

427
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,760
(Horse snorts)

428
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,320
Yes, it's been a long time.

429
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,800
But l still remember every face.

430
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,360
You remember your first?

431
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Of course, Your Grace.

432
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,720
Who was it?

433
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,360
A Tyroshi.

434
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,080
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

435
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,320
How did you do it?

436
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,280
Lance through the heart.

437
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,040
Quick one.

438
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
Lucky for you.

439
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,360
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

440
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,200
My horse took an arrow so l was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

441
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,520
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

442
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,120
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

443
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,360
l knocked him down with the hammer.

444
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,720
Gods, l was strong then.

445
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,440
Caved in his breastplate.

446
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,720
Probably shattered every rib he had.

447
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,280
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

448
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,200
Right before l brought it down
he shouted, ''Wait! Wait.''

449
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,320
(Laughs)

450
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,120
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

451
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,360
They don't put that part in the songs.

452
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,200
Stupid boy.

453
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,200
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

454
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,760
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

455
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,280
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

456
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,160
his sons would be ingrates,

457
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,560
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

458
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
Wine!

459
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,200
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

460
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,720
Lancel Lannister.

461
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,720
Who named you?
Some halmit with a stutter?

462
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,880
(Laughs)

463
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,640
What are you doing?

464
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,520
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

465
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,320
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

466
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,440
So get more.

467
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,440
Tell your cousin to get in here.

468
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,520
Kingslayer! Get in here.

469
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,760
Surrounded by Lannisters.

470
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,440
Every time l close my eyes
l see their blond hair

471
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,800
and their smug, satisfied faces.

472
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,720
lt must wound your pride, huh?

473
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,560
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

474
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,640
Jaime Lannister
son of the mighty Tyw! in...

475
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,080
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

476
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,440
So come on.

477
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,440
We're telling war stories.

478
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,120
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

479
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,840
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

480
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,360
l was there that day.

481
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,440
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

482
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,280
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

483
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Best move l ever saw.

484
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,600
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

485
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,760
Your outlaw...

486
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,200
any last words?

487
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,920
- l cut his head om, so no.
- Hmm.

488
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,800
What about Aerys Targaryen?

489
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,560
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

490
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
l never asked.

491
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,520
Did he call you a traitor?

492
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,520
Did he plead for a reprieve?

493
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,880
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

494
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,560
''Burn them all.''

495
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,000
lf that's all, Your Grace...

496
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,360
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

497
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,400
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

498
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,640
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

499
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,120
From whom?

500
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,640
lf you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

501
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,480
pay tribute or fight.

502
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,240
An easy choice for most.

503
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,600
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

504
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,960
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

505
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,400
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

506
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,120
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

507
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,080
- and need the practice.
- (Speaks Dothraki)

508
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,240
(Slave whimpering)
(Whip cracking)

509
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,920
Tell them all to stop.

510
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,000
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

511
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,760
Until l command them otheM/ise.

512
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,520
You're learning to talk like a queen.

513
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,480
Not a queen.

514
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,360
A khaleesi.

515
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,600
(Jorah speaks Dothraki)

516
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,200
(Branches rustling)

517
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,680
(Blade clanging)

518
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,800
- (Horse neighs)
- You dare!

519
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,040
You give commands to me? To me?

520
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,440
You do not command the dragon.
l am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

521
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,080
l don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

522
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,240
(Speaks Dothraki)

523
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,800
- (Viserys gasping)
- Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

524
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,360
No.

525
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,600
(Speaks Dothraki)

526
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,200
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

527
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

528
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,400
Tell him l don't want my brother harmed.

529
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,960
(Speaks Dothraki)

530
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,320
Huh?

531
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,920
(Speaks Dothraki)
(Gasping)

532
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,000
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

533
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,720
l am your king!

534
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,680
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

535
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,080
Uh uh uh uh uh.

536
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,960
You...walk.

537
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,320
(Clicks tongue)

538
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
(Wind howling)

539
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,680
(Metal clangs)

540
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,920
(Creaking)

541
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,160
(Bell dings)

542
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,720
(Wind roaring)

543
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,280
(Benjen) l wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.

544
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,280
- l'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

545
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,400
l'm the First Ranger.

546
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,800
My job is out there.

547
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

548
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,800
The kind l don't want to believe.

549
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,760
l'm ready. l won't let you down.

550
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,200
You're not going.

551
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,280
You're no ranger, Jon.

552
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,920
- But l'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

553
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,680
Here...

554
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,920
a man gets what he earns,

555
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,000
when he earns it.

556
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
We'll speak when l return.

557
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,840
(Wind howling)

558
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,840
- A bear's balls.
- (Tyrion) Oh, you're joking?

559
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,200
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

560
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,760
all fried in his own fat.

561
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,320
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

562
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,760
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

563
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,840
And how do a bear's balls taste?

564
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,080
A bit chewy. (Laughs)

565
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,120
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

566
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,800
Do Dornish girls count?

567
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,840
(Both laugh)

568
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,720
So...you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

569
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,760
and bring them here as eager recruits?

570
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,520
Aye.

571
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,440
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

572
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,320
Some of 'em's just poor lads
Iooking for steady feed.

573
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,200
Some of 'em's high-born lads
Iooking for glory.

574
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,320
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

575
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
(Door opens)

576
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,920
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

577
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,040
ls that what we are, Lannister?
An army ofjesters in black?

578
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,160
You don't have enough men
to be an army

579
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,720
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

580
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,400
l hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

581
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,200
when you're back in King's Landing.

582
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,760
lt's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

583
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,800
enjoying your brothels.

584
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,000
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

585
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,200
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

586
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,800
might be sickness,

587
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,520
might just be the cold.

588
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,320
They die in pain.

589
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,880
And they do it...

590
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,920
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

591
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,320
Do you think l'm plump?

592
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,960
- Listen, Benjen... May l call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

593
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,280
l'm not sure what l've done to omend you.

594
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,360
l have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

595
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,800
l've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

596
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,840
You know, my brother once told me...

597
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,280
that nothing someone says
before the word ''but'' really counts.

598
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,960
But...

599
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,840
l don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

600
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,680
are lurking beyond the Wall.

601
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,680
l believe that the only dimerence
between us and the wildlings

602
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,400
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

603
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,520
to live on the right side of it.

604
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,360
You're right.

605
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,040
The wildlings are no dimerent from us.

606
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,800
A little rougher maybe.

607
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,440
But they're made of meat and bone.

608
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,040
l know how to track them
and l know how to kill them.

609
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,720
lt's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

610
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,200
I
You've never been north of the Wall
so don't tell me what's out there.

611
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,520
Are you going below?

612
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,200
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

613
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,960
Oh, l always do.

614
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,880
l think he's starting to like me.

615
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,480
(Laughing)

616
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,760
- ''Going below''?
- Aye.

617
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,520
lnto the tunnel and out the other side.

618
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,120
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

619
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,200
So...you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

620
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,760
Aye, day after tomorrow.

621
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,440
l get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

622
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,520
Let's share the road.
l could use some decent company.

623
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,680
l, er...

624
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,400
l travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

625
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,240
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

626
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,640
No one turns away a Lannister.

627
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,360
(Enunciates word in Dothraki)

628
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,040
(Speaks word in Dothraki)

629
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:05,320
(Enunciates Dothraki word)

630
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,840
(Speaks Dothraki word)

631
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,040
(Repeats Dothraki word)

632
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,720
Yes, Khaleesi.

633
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,560
Oh, what are you doing?

634
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:17,120
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

635
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,360
You change, Khaleesi.

636
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,040
lt's a blessing from the Great Stallion

637
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,080
(Jorah) For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

638
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,800
easier to handle.

639
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,680
lt's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

640
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,800
But a man in full plate... (Speaks Dothraki)

641
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
..the arakh won't get through the steel.

642
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,120
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

643
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,000
Designed for piercing plate.

644
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,240
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

645
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,160
(Speaks English) Armour.
(Speaks English) Armour.

646
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,760
Armour make a man, erm...

647
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,800
- (Speaks Dothraki)
- Slow.

648
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,360
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

649
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,320
My father taught me how to fight.

650
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,720
He taught me that speed defeats size.

651
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,480
l've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

652
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,840
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

653
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,040
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?

654
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,480
(Speaks English) He still is.

655
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,880
A man of great honour

656
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,760
and l betrayed him.

657
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,680
The Khaleesi wants
to eat something dimerent tonight.

658
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,720
Kill some rabbits.

659
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,800
There are no rabbits.

660
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,480
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

661
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,920
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.

662
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,280
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?

663
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Dog then.
l have seen many dogs.

664
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,760
(Speaks English)
l don't think she wants to eat dog.

665
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,560
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

666
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:08,240
lt is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

667
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,600
Her belly start to swell.

668
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,600
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

669
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,640
(Woman) She does not want to eat horse.

670
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,320
l'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

671
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,280
(Mutters)

672
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,840
l need to ride to Qohor.

673
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,520
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

674
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:36,760
Don't worry. l'll catch you.

675
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,160
The horde's easy to find.

676
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,720
(Grunts, swords clash)

677
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,400
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

678
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:01,200
Except for you. You move too much.

679
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,760
l could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

680
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
(Maester Aemon) How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

681
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,240
Eight. No, nine.

682
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,680
All of them brief?

683
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,720
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

684
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,760
This summer has lasted nine.

685
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,920
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

686
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,280
The Starks are always right eventually -

687
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,720
winter is coming.

688
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,560
This one will be long...

689
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,480
and dark things will come with it.

690
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,000
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

691
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,360
They're fleeing south.

692
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,440
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

693
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:50,680
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

694
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,120
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

695
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,080
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head om.

696
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,440
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

697
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,840
and what lies beyond.

698
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,280
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

699
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,920
There are less than a thousand of us now.

700
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,600
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

701
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,560
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

702
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,880
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

703
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,760
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

704
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,920
Tell her...we need help.

705
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,640
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

706
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,000
lt's a boy.

707
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,480
How do you know?

708
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,680
l know.

709
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,920
(Wind blowing)

710
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
l'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

711
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,680
lt's either me or this cold,

712
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,960
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

713
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,720
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

714
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,000
l expect l will.

715
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,080
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

716
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,120
lf you see my brother Bran,

717
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:01,760
tell him l miss him.

718
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,920
Tell him l'd visit if l could.

719
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,240
Of course.

720
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,680
He'll never walk again.

721
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,440
lf you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

722
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,840
You take care, Snow.

723
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,720
Farewell, my lord.

724
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,440
(Foreign accent) You are late, boy.

725
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,640
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

726
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,920
Who are you?

727
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,680
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

728
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,200
Tomorrow you will catch it.

729
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,040
Now pick it up.

730
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,600
That is not the way, boy.

731
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:55,640
lt is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

732
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,560
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

733
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:01,360
to make you strong.

734
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,760
Just so.

735
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,080
One hand is all that is needed.

736
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,320
Now you are standing all wrong.

737
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,680
Turn your body sideface.

738
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,960
Yes.

739
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,200
So.

740
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,520
You are skinny. That is good.

741
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,320
The target is smaller.

742
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
Now the grip - let me see.

743
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,080
Yes.

744
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,720
The grip must be delicate.

745
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,520
What if l drop it?

746
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,880
The steel must be part of your arm.

747
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,520
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

748
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,520
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

749
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,240
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

750
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,000
l'm a girl.

751
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,280
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

752
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,760
(He tuts)

753
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,600
That is the grip.

754
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,560
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

755
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,960
A needle.

756
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,600
Ahhh. (Chuckles)

757
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,080
Just so.

758
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:05,800
Now we will begin the dance.

759
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,280
Remember, child,

760
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,120
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

761
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,880
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

762
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:17,560
This is the Braavos dance...

763
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:20,840
the water dance.

764
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,040
lt is swift...

765
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:25,280
and sudden.

766
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,800
All men are made of water.

767
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,560
Do you know this?

768
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,880
lf you pierce them,

769
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,440
the water leaks out and they die.

770
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:40,760
Now you will try to strike me.

771
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,480
Ha!

772
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,080
Up!

773
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,480
(Tuts)

774
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,400
Ha!

775
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,480
Ah.

776
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,400
Dead.

777
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:19,440
(Laughs) Oh!

778
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:21,120
Dead.

779
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,000
- (Swords clashing)
- Hup!

780
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,400
Very dead.

781
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:29,240
- (Chuckles)
- (Syrio) Come.

782
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,880
Ah ah ah!

783
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,640
- Hup!
- (Swords clash)

784
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,120
Again, faster.

785
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,240
Ah.

786
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,120
(Weapons clanging,
warriors shouting)
