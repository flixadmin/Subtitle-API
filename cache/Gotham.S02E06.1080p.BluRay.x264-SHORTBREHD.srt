1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,088
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:05,507
How I ever let him lay a hand on me...

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,303
<i>I'm glad he's out of your life.</i>

4
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,807
Keep that guard up! Jab, jab.
Lead jab, jab, right.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,101
- What are you doing?
- Alfred's teaching me to fight.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,602
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,770
The firebugs from the Narrows?

8
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:20,605
<i>I used to hang with their sister, Bridgit.</i>

9
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,775
Hey, boys. We need the best,
and you guys are the best.

10
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,569
<i>Bridgy. You just got a promotion.</i>

11
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,241
- G.C.P.D.!
- Run!

12
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,579
- I've got her! Drop it!
- No!

13
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:38,873
No!

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,292
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,546
- Mother!
<i>- Please! I don't know nothing.</i>

16
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,005
You are going to go to Galavan.

17
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,967
Once you're inside his organization,
you will find my mother and rescue her.

18
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:50,927
He'll buy it, if we sell it right.

19
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,935
And then Penguin just went crazy.

20
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,523
I mean, like,
crazier than I've ever seen him.

21
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,861
He said it was me
that set up the count house raid.

22
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,904
Said I was a traitor and a rat.

23
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,409
And he came at me with a cleaver.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:19,581
I tried to protect myself
and he did this, that sick bastard.

25
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,419
How'd you get away?

26
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,422
<i>There was a lot of blood. A lot.</i>

27
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:32,135
<i>And he tried to take another swing and
he slipped and fell, and so I just ran.</i>

28
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:37,682
And I ran and I ran and then, next thing
I knew, I woke up in the hospital.

29
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:40,727
Hmm.

30
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:46,441
Give me a shot, Mr. Galavan,
let me show you what I can do.

31
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,569
Well, I'd like to help you out, Butch,

32
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:54,949
but I already have several capable
two-handed thugs in my employ.

33
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,953
They don't know Gotham like I do.
I got brains, you ask anyone!

34
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,164
What do you think, ladies?

35
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,043
I think he's cute. Like a sad bear.

36
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,381
I suppose he's telling the truth.

37
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,802
<i>The little man was cracking up
last time I saw him.</i>

38
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,346
He was very mean to me once.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,973
<i>Held me hostage in my own apartment.</i>

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,311
Said some nasty things.
Isn't that right, Stumpy?

41
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,730
That's right, ma'am. And I'm sorry for it.

42
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>Business is business, you know?</i>

43
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,738
Please. Let me work for you, Mr. Galavan.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,408
I got nobody else to turn to.

45
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,285
Oh, yes!

46
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:45,250
We can put cool things on his stump,
like knives and mallets and stuff.

47
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,210
Ooh!

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,963
How about a little tiny chainsaw?

49
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,589
Yes!

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,841
Huh.

51
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,011
Well, that settles it.
Welcome aboard, Butch.

52
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,972
Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:06,271
Oh! Oh! Bravo, Congressman. Well saved.

54
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,940
You really are quite spry for a big man.

55
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,985
Have you reconsidered your position?

56
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:15,029
Can I count on your support this election?

57
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:18,324
Yes, yes! You have my full support!

58
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:19,951
Thank you so much.

59
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,114
Freeze!

60
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:04,829
Man, I didn't do nothing!
Why are you chasing me?

61
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,539
A police officer died last night.

62
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:10,543
Killed by a firebug crew on a spree.
You're a firebug, aren't you?

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,670
No, man, I been out the game a long time!

64
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,634
- Don't lie to me, Nino.
- I swear.

65
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,802
Sir, that's a violation
of the officer conduct regs.

66
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,513
Luke Garrett burned to death
in front of me twelve hours ago.

67
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,182
I'll conduct myself as I see fit.

68
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,354
This crew's working with a kid. A girl.
Wears a homemade fire suit.

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,148
Hey, for real, never heard
of a female firebug before.

70
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,068
It's mad rare, like a...
Like a unicorn or something.

71
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,709
Sir, Captain Barnes says
we must report any infractions.

72
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,629
Even by superior officers.

73
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:55,880
You do that.

74
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,474
What are you doing?

75
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,021
I can't sleep.
I don't know what to do with myself.

76
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,901
That's the point of being free.

77
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,362
You get to do whatever the hell you want.

78
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,697
What am I gonna do?

79
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,827
I killed someone last night.
I can't go home. I can't go to the police.

80
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:26,995
You gotta get out of town.

81
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,497
How? I got no money.

82
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:36,087
No problem. We'll get some.

83
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,048
You mean, like, crime?

84
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,718
Man, you are square.

85
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,724
I guess I got no choice.

86
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,894
Why are you helping me?

87
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,355
Maybe you remind me of me

88
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:56,941
if I was a doofus.

89
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,322
This crime...
What exactly you got in mind?

90
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,789
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

91
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,751
Or should I say pimps, hos and thieves?

92
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,836
Do I have some product for you today!

93
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,629
Do you like what you see?

94
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,339
Come on, now, let me hear you!

95
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,966
Do you like what you see?

96
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:29,432
All right. Oh, check it out, check it out!
Yes! Nice and sturdy

97
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,018
- I want her!
- Bidding will start at $800 apiece!

98
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,146
- And we got $800! Can I get--
- Yo, $850!

99
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,982
We got $850. Can I get $900?
Can I get nine?

100
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,694
Those girls are for sale?

101
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,238
Told you this place was freaky.

102
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,825
We need to help them.

103
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,997
We're here to help you.
'Cause you killed a cop, remember?

104
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,749
We get the money, we go.

105
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,834
- But--
- Listen. Listen.

106
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:06,094
You go down the stairs.
The lock on the back door is busted.

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,057
I know, 'cause I busted it.
You go in, wait for me to make my move.

108
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,600
How will I know when?

109
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,852
Pay attention.

110
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,656
Sold for $2,500
to the gentleman in the burgundy hat!

111
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,866
Yes, indeedy! Come on, ladies.

112
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,910
<i>Found you a nice new home!</i>

113
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:34,372
<i>Oh, you'll be very satisfied!
You'll be very, very satisfied!</i>

114
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,876
<i>Next up, check her out as she walks
down the stage, see how graceful she is!</i>

115
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,378
<i>Look at this one!</i>

116
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,422
<i>I'll start the bidding here at $900!</i>

117
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,551
<i>Can I get $900? $900 over here.</i>

118
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,389
Hey, pervs! This is a robbery!

119
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,933
Milo! Kill that punk!

120
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,899
She's with me.

121
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,321
Now, each of you
put all your cash in the bag.

122
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,657
Or what? I ain't scared of you.

123
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,126
Yeah, all right.

124
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,255
Anybody else got a problem?
Yeah, I didn't think so.

125
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,930
And for the record, all y'all suck!

126
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,111
Come on! Please! Get me out of here!

127
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,448
<i>I can't stay here.</i>

128
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,120
Hey, you! Hey! Stop!

129
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,046
Oh, my God.

130
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,423
I know, right? Let's go!

131
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,097
A note in my file? Are you serious?

132
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,974
Do I look like I'm joking?

133
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:21,187
We do not beat suspects. Ever!

134
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,320
I get it. Luke was a good kid.

135
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,740
We took him out of the academy.
Told him he was ready. Now he's dead.

136
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,825
You lose people in war. You know that.

137
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,620
<i>Make no mistake, this is war.</i>

138
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,040
But that doesn't give you or me
the license to break the law.

139
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,710
There's a line.
I learned that the hard way.

140
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,215
Respectfully, sir, this is Gotham.

141
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:53,928
There are gray areas.
I've learned that the hard way, too.

142
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,599
And did you even get a lead
while you were out avenging Luke?

143
00:09:58,849 --> 00:09:59,892
No, sir.

144
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,478
"No, sir." Well, you got one now.

145
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,732
Bodega owner called this in.

146
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,567
His security camera caught it.

147
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,029
She's our firefly.
We don't know who the other one is.

148
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,375
I do. Damn it.

149
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:37,596
Focus. Focus. Keep your head down.

150
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,975
Head down! Distractions will be
the death of you, Master Bruce.

151
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,937
Now, get on your toes. On your toes. Move!

152
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,776
Well, don't dance around
like a bloody showgirl. Come on.

153
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:55,614
That's better. Better.
Now, big left. Big left. Go on.

154
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,033
Right. I've got you!

155
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,951
- Now, your enemies...
- Hey!

156
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,953
...are gonna fight
a lot dirtier than that.

157
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,831
Ow! Ow!

158
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,917
Bloody hell.

159
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,172
Very good, Master Bruce.

160
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,758
Eh?

161
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,926
Have you spoken to Mr. Fox
about the computer?

162
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,136
That I have, yeah.

163
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,429
How much longer till it's fixed?

164
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,724
I'll tell you when it's done,
won't I? Patience.

165
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm tired of patience, Alfred.
I'm ready to begin!

166
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,729
I'll tell you when you're ready,
Master Bruce.

167
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,272
I'm ready now. I know I am.

168
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,859
Oh, by the way, by the way,
Miss Silver called.

169
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,486
She wants you
to go for dinner this evening.

170
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,282
- Silver called?
- Yeah.

171
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,664
Told you. Not ready.

172
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,005
- Let's go.
- Left.

173
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,009
<i>Well, he just up
and moved out of town.</i>

174
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,969
<i>It was rude and inconsiderate.</i>

175
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,097
<i>And perfectly in character
for Tom Dougherty.</i>

176
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,640
Do you ever wonder where he went?

177
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,351
He could be dead in a ditch,
for all I care.

178
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,686
<i>- Kristen!
- And I mean it, too.</i>

179
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,898
He, um... He wasn't very nice to me.

180
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,859
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

181
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,319
<i>Thank you</i>.

182
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,614
<i>But it all worked out for the best.</i>

183
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,867
<i>I know!
You and Ed seem to be getting along.</i>

184
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,162
He is so gentle and kind.

185
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,332
Almost too gentle.

186
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,503
<i>I think a man needs to have a little fire,</i>

187
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,338
<i>a little danger in him, don't you think?</i>

188
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,507
Oh, I don't know about that.

189
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:42,012
And sometimes I feel like
he's holding something back from me.

190
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,639
<i>Like a secret?</i>

191
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,933
I don't know.

192
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,853
I just... I guess, I just wish
he would open up a little more.

193
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,068
Good morning!
Miss Kringle, Miss Thompkins.

194
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,237
Hi.

195
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,613
What do you call a three-legged cow?

196
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,907
- I am terrible with--
- Lean beef!

197
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,702
Or supper. At my place.

198
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,707
Oh, Ed.

199
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,005
Aw

200
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:22,011
Ginger to ginger, we both know
you know where Selina Kyle's at.

201
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,848
So, why don't you tell me now
and save us the hassle?

202
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,808
Who's Selina Kyle?

203
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,935
- Cat.
- Cat?

204
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,523
Look, Ivy, want me to call the children's
home and have 'em come get you now?

205
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,819
Or should I get a candy bar
and forget to have someone watch you?

206
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,239
Candy bar.

207
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,994
I struck out. None of the street kids
I talked to have seen Selina.

208
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,079
Relax. Your Uncle Harvey has you covered.

209
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,790
She's in a squat off Jenkins.
Condemned SRO.

210
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,584
I know it.

211
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,713
Hey, last time we saw this chick,
she had a shotgun pointed at us.

212
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,924
Maybe you should take
the Fascist youth, huh?

213
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,469
Nah, with Selina, it's best to go quietly.

214
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,887
Come on!

215
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:13,437
When you get to the bus station,
take the first bus south.

216
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,773
Stay on till the end of the line.

217
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,733
Well, what do I do then?

218
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,944
You got plenty of money.
You can do what you like.

219
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,866
Thank you. For everything.
You've been a really good friend.

220
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,537
I got my cut. No biggie.

221
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,006
Bridgit, you need to run!
Bridgit, run! Run!

222
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:46,595
- Bridgit!
- No! Selina! No! Selina! No! No!

223
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,104
<i>Help me! No! Stop!</i>

224
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,730
Hey!

225
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,097
Hands in the air!

226
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,106
- Drop the gun.
- Like hell I will.

227
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,276
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Who?

228
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,028
We got both of you on tape.

229
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,821
Don't know what you're
talking about, Gordon.

230
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,700
She's burned down half a dozen buildings.

231
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,162
Killed a cop.
You're running with a bad partner, kid.

232
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:56,248
You don't understand.
She was forced to do all of that!

233
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:02,630
Okay.

234
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:10,888
Let me help her. Who is she?
Who's forcing her to do this?

235
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,853
Look, there's a lot of
angry cops out there.

236
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,940
She's gonna get shot on sight
unless I get to her first.

237
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,324
Her name is Bridgit Pike.

238
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,411
Her brothers took her back.
Joe and Cale Pike.

239
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,413
They, like, kidnapped her.

240
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,125
They're the ones who made her
start burning stuff in the first place.

241
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,919
It's their fault the cop died!

242
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,921
The Pike brothers?

243
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,384
Why'd they burn down Wayne
Enterprises' buildings? Who paid them?

244
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,302
Why the hell should I know
why the Pikes do anything?

245
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,553
They're freaking nuts.

246
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,931
They treated Bridgit like a slave,
chained her to the wall.

247
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,600
And you're angry about it.
Is that why you're armed?

248
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,269
You gonna go after the Pikes?
Rescue your friend?

249
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,438
- No.
- That's a yes.

250
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:06,276
Look, you're gonna get your friend and
yourself killed. Let me handle the Pikes.

251
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:11,532
No offense, Jim, but I like
my chances better than yours.

252
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,786
Why get involved? Why risk your neck?

253
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,538
Who is this girl to you?

254
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,084
No one. Just a girl in the neighborhood.

255
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,842
I give you my word, I will do
everything I can to keep her safe.

256
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,011
<i>But you have to stay out of it.</i>

257
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,597
Tell me where she is.

258
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,814
Damn. She's got six grand here.

259
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,108
Little Bridgy put on her big-girl pants.

260
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,318
You can take all of it, I don't care.

261
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,529
Oh, I'm taking it. That's not the issue.

262
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,616
The issue is you thinking it's cool
to just ditch your brothers. Hmm?

263
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,164
Oh, snap! Bridgit's gonna get it!

264
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,832
Joe, please...

265
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,129
Did you even think about us, hmm?
Did you even think how we would feel?

266
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:11,216
No, don't!
Joe, I didn't mean anything by it!

267
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,179
I'm a sensitive guy
and you hurt my feelings.

268
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,683
I mean, without family, what do you got?

269
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,727
You got nothing, right?

270
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,437
You wanna be part of the family again?

271
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,903
I said...

272
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,033
Do you feel like
being part of this family again?

273
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,287
Yes!

274
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:45,334
Damn! Damn,
that hurt! Bridgit's back.

275
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,884
If you try anything like that again,
I'll kill you.

276
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:59,556
And I'll skin that little cat-bitch, too,
you hear me? You're never leaving.

277
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:01,975
Yes.

278
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:06,772
Good. Go make our supper.
All right, let's pack it up.

279
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:26,583
Dear me. A mallet. That's, um... Useful?

280
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,460
Don't even start.

281
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,380
Tell me you bring good news.

282
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,675
I'm in. I'm in good.

283
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,385
And? And?

284
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,763
I'm asking questions. But it's dangerous.

285
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,059
If I push too hard, Galavan will be
onto me. I told you, he's a smart guy.

286
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,230
Look at me, Butch.

287
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,275
Are you my servant?

288
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,778
Yes.

289
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,322
Do you obey me in all things?

290
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,824
Yes.

291
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,702
Then why do you bring me excuses?

292
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,457
Go find my mother
before I chop off your other hand.

293
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,961
Yes, boss.

294
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,342
Come on, harder!

295
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,433
Come on, Joe.

296
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,150
What are you gonna do? Kill us?

297
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,152
Yep.

298
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh, God!

299
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,347
I'll check the other room.

300
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,526
Clear! She's not here.

301
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,948
Damn. I hate how it
smells like good barbecue.

302
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,035
Bitch.

303
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,206
Bullock! Hey!

304
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,042
What? He scared the hell out of me.

305
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,802
And now he's dead. Nice work, Bullock.

306
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh, yeah, my kicks did it?

307
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,138
Maybe it's because
he's fried like a taquito!

308
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,059
- It's not on me.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,729
Looks like Selina was telling the truth.

310
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,527
Look, I don't want to speak ill of the
dead, but these ass-hats had it coming.

311
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,697
These ass-hats were professional
arsonists. Somebody hired them.

312
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,365
But why Wayne Enterprises?

313
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,950
Who cares? All right?

314
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:08,870
There's a freaky firefly chick
on the loose with a flamethrower.

315
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,747
Let's start there.

316
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,100
Hallelujah.

317
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,442
<i>Hello, Butch.
Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

318
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,653
I just wanted to check in.

319
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,698
See how things were going. Any complaints?

320
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,200
No. No, sir.
I'm fine like a bottle of wine.

321
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,745
Good.

322
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,583
You could have a real future here.

323
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,503
<i>You are a hard worker,
and you're loyal to a fault.</i>

324
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,921
Thank you, boss.

325
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,424
If only you were loyal to me.

326
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,304
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

327
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,973
Come on, Butch, have some dignity.
I know what you were doing.

328
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,392
You were looking for Penguin's mother,
weren't you?

329
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,229
The hand was a nice touch.
Almost fooled me.

330
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,859
How on Earth did Penguin
get you to do that?

331
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,155
I'm his servant.
I have to obey him in all things.

332
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,991
Penguin's done a number on you, huh?

333
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,577
<i>Tinkered with your wiring.</i>

334
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:38,168
Perhaps we can help. Tabby?
Tabby, could you come here, please?

335
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,342
Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.

336
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,511
Can we help?

337
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,262
Be my pleasure.

338
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,058
All right, look, let's...
Let's talk about this.

339
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,978
Can we talk about this?
Take it easy, what are you doing?

340
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,565
Relax. We just want to help.

341
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,503
I'll leave you two to it.
Uh, remember, dinner's in an hour.

342
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,643
We've set up a perimeter.
She can't have gotten far.

343
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,311
And we're sitting on Selina Kyle's place.

344
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,729
Keep me posted.

345
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,238
Bridgit Pike was abused her whole life.

346
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:53,076
Forced to set those fires. I promised
my informant I would keep her safe.

347
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,958
Weren't you the one saying
that Luke Garrett was just a kid?

348
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,877
That we owe him justice?

349
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,254
- I know that's what I said--
- And you were right.

350
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:09,801
And now she killed him.
Now she has two more dead bodies on her.

351
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,971
So I don't care about the hows
and the whys and the boohoos.

352
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,265
<i>You don't make promises you can't keep.</i>

353
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,728
Now, you find her and
you take her down. Clear?

354
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,438
Yes, sir.

355
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,507
We must have spent years up here,
watching these birds.

356
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,971
Remember when Mickey Slattery
called us orphan bastards

357
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,765
and we tried to throw him off the roof?

358
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:03,730
The cops are outside my place.
You need to get out of town.

359
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,106
I'm not scared of them.

360
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,234
Bridgit, I know what you did
to your brothers.

361
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:11,321
Not that they didn't deserve it, but...
Whoa.

362
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,865
I was surprised.

363
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,786
Cale flamed up good, but it was Joe
who burned the brightest.

364
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,247
You don't sound like yourself.

365
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:25,418
I'm not myself anymore. I'm free.
Just like you told me I was.

366
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,587
So what are you gonna do?

367
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,547
I'm gonna go after the rest of them.

368
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,799
The rest of who?

369
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:35,303
The pervs and the bullies.
The ones who hurt people like us.

370
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,014
No one's ever gone after me or hurt me.

371
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,183
Yeah, right.

372
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:46,231
Rule number one, look after number one.
That's you.

373
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,860
Don't be crazy,
or you'll get yourself killed.

374
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:54,447
Don't worry about me, Selina.
This is what I was meant to do.

375
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,199
Bridgit, please, don't do this.

376
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,538
It's nice to have someone
who cares about me. Thank you.

377
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,959
I don't care.
I just think you're being dumb.

378
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,130
But... Hey. Good luck.

379
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,394
I'll see you around.

380
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,580
A toast.

381
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,750
I'm so sorry.

382
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,128
Something came up last minute.

383
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,762
As I was saying...

384
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,723
- To family.
- Mmm.

385
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,268
In the end, it's all that matters.

386
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,939
Family.

387
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:18,073
I hope, in time, you'll come to think
of us as family, Bruce.

388
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,577
Thank you. It's...

389
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,830
It's been some time
since I had a meal like this.

390
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,290
You mean with girls?

391
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,712
You should come over more often.
We can, like, hang out or whatever.

392
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,672
I'd like that.

393
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,052
Look how cute they are.
Don't you just want to eat them?

394
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,097
Tabitha, leave the young people alone.

395
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,641
Well, they are cute, and they know it.

396
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,073
These were the best
mashed potatoes I have ever had.

397
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,991
I swear I'm gonna get plump.

398
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,535
I like that you have an appetite.

399
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,245
Stop it, you're spoiling me.

400
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,706
I won't stop it.
I want nothing more than to spoil you.

401
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,710
Oh... Ed! So forceful.

402
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,632
There's something else
that I want to tell you.

403
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,512
But I just...
I don't want to scare you away.

404
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,057
Please. Tell me anything.
Do not hold back.

405
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,198
Kristen...

406
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,243
I like you very much.

407
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,079
I... I feel the same way about you.

408
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,414
And, um...

409
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,207
"And..." Shh.

410
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:14,898
Mr. Nygma, is that your bedroom
over there?

411
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,905
Why, yes, it is.

412
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,789
Gordon, phone call for you.

413
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:35,919
This is Gordon.

414
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:37,921
Do you remember your promise?

415
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,298
Yes.

416
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,593
I think I know where she's going.

417
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,107
No! No, please!

418
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:02,904
Go! Go! Go! Just go! Go! Go!

419
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,948
Help me!

420
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,241
Come on!

421
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,369
All right! Go, go, go!

422
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,048
All right, no one gets hurt tonight.
We follow protocols and stay safe.

423
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,466
Yes, sir.

424
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,677
Freeze! Hands in the air!

425
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,136
Hold your fire!

426
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,807
Bridgit Pike?

427
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,308
Stay away!

428
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,019
My name's Jim Gordon.

429
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,732
I know what your brothers did to you.

430
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,319
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

431
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,280
You don't know anything.

432
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:49,534
You put your weapon down and come with me,
I can help you.

433
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,120
<i>There are places you can go.</i>

434
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,621
I'm not going to jail!

435
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:57,292
You're a juvenile,
we can work something out.

436
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,505
- Wait, wait!
- I said hold your fire!

437
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,349
Bridgit! Stop!

438
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,602
Take cover!

439
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,031
Bridgit! Wait!

440
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:57,852
I'm glad we have a moment alone.
There is something I need to discuss.

441
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,979
Oh?

442
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:05,151
An executive at Wayne Enterprises
has been reported missing.

443
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,780
Sid Bunderslaw. Do you know him?

444
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,910
Yes. We've met several times.

445
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,245
What happened?

446
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,873
No one knows. But it doesn't look good.

447
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,291
How did you hear?

448
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,418
Let's just say
I have friends in high places.

449
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:26,255
And I've been following the goings-on
at Wayne Enterprises very closely.

450
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,758
What have you learned?

451
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:32,303
That your father was a good man.
A great man, even.

452
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,808
But in spite of that,
bad things happened at his company.

453
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,357
Unfortunately, I think you're right.

454
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,776
I can tell you're very mature
for your age.

455
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,697
Ready to tackle the problems
of your company head-on.

456
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:56,953
But you'll need help. Once I'm mayor,
I would very much like to be that person.

457
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:06,212
Thank you, Mr. Galavan. I appreciate it.

458
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,143
Butch? What has happened?

459
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:21,978
I found your mother.

460
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,646
Where?

461
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,774
In a warehouse down by the port.
But they caught me looking.

462
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,694
You half-wit, if they kill my mother--

463
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,028
Look, they don't know I'm here.

464
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,906
The tiger lady, she wanted to take
her time with me, so she chained me up.

465
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,826
And I got out. We gotta go now.

466
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,957
Yes. Yes. Yes. Good, Butch.

467
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:49,338
You've done well. Your loyalty will
be rewarded handsomely. I swear it.

468
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,340
Yes, boss.

469
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:55,762
Rest here for a minute
and I'll go gather the troops.

470
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,937
<i>How old are you?</i>

471
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,982
Old enough to shoot you,
if that's what you're thinking.

472
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,610
No, that's not what I was thinking.

473
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,196
You don't have to point the gun at me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

474
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,530
Damn right you're not.

475
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,367
- My name is Lee.
- I know what your name is.

476
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,203
What's your name?

477
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,539
You're cute. For a doctor.

478
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,167
Thanks! You're cute, for a gangster.

479
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,509
Hi, Selina. Sorry about this, Lee.

480
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,968
Oh, hey. No problem.

481
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,189
So? Is Bridgit okay?

482
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:53,152
I'm sorry. She's not gonna make it.

483
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,449
You said that you'd help her!

484
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,868
I tried, Selina. I tried.

485
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,787
But she didn't wanna go quietly.

486
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,458
I think she wanted it to end this way.

487
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,303
Look, Selina--

488
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,264
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

489
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,684
I know you were
telling the truth about Bridgit.

490
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:31,190
That her brothers put her up to this.
I need to know who hired them.

491
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:34,318
I already told you I don't know.

492
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,570
And I still don't believe you.

493
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,281
What do you care?
You don't care about people like us.

494
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,658
It's not like you're really gonna
go after your little friend.

495
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,243
My friend?

496
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:46,873
Do you mean Penguin?

497
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,837
Why would he set those fires?
That doesn't make any sense.

498
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,131
Ask him yourself.

499
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,802
I'm done talking to you.

500
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,642
I should have never trusted a cop.

501
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,187
I tried to help her.
It just went a different way.

502
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,481
Is that what you call it
when someone dies?

503
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,277
Is that what you tell yourself?

504
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,738
I'm sorry.

505
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,160
Whatever.

506
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,851
You're so sweet.

507
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,228
Kristen, what's the matter?

508
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,564
Um...

509
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,024
I'm scared.

510
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:56,609
Of what?

511
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,194
Of Tom Dougherty.

512
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:05,076
He used to tell me, if he ever saw me
with another man, he would kill me.

513
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,580
I'm terrified of what will happen
when he comes back.

514
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:11,707
- You don't need to worry about that.
- Mmm.

515
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,378
You don't know him. He is a monster.

516
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:19,423
Listen to me. You do not need
to worry about Tom Dougherty.

517
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,386
You are sweet. But...

518
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,389
You're not a fighter.
You couldn't possibly take him on.

519
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,559
Trust me, he's been taken care of.

520
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,229
What does that mean?

521
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,232
Um...

522
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,569
Some time ago,
he and I had an altercation.

523
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,613
I asked him
to treat you with more respect.

524
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,073
Oh, my God.

525
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,701
And he said he would treat you
any way he liked, and he assaulted me.

526
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,035
Oh, my God!

527
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,829
So, anyhow, long story short...

528
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,209
I killed him.

529
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,715
Oh, Ed. That's...
You had me going for a minute, there.

530
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,467
It was outside of your apartment,
under the elevated train.

531
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,969
I stabbed him and he died.

532
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,262
Ed, that's not funny.

533
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm not being funny.

534
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,949
"T. Dougherty."

535
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,035
Do you believe me now?

536
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,496
Oh, my God.

537
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,669
What's wrong? Where are you going?

538
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,005
- Ah... How could you?
- No, please, sit down.

539
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,423
Don't touch me!

540
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,383
Would you please let me explain?

541
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,136
There is nothing to explain.
I don't even know who you are.

542
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,138
No, that's wrong. You are a murderer.

543
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,142
He was a monster!
You said so. He was abusing you!

544
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,145
I can't believe I even fell for you,
you sicko!

545
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:59,482
I'm not sick! I love you.
I did it for you.

546
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:03,360
Everything I ever thought about you, I was
right! I should have my head examined!

547
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:04,695
Don't say that.

548
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,655
Wait, what were you doing
outside my house?

549
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,074
I was worried for you.

550
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,659
You were stalking me!
You are a psychopath!

551
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:14,413
That is not true! That's not who I am.
Don't say that about me.

552
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,833
You are going to prison where
they will do horrible things to you.

553
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,001
Things that you deserve.

554
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,628
Don't say that to me!

555
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,089
No, let go! Don't touch me!

556
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,134
Let go of me, you freak!

557
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,344
Please don't call me that!

558
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,012
Ow!

559
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,431
Help!

560
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:37,061
Listen to me!
I am not the man that you think I am.

561
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,188
I would never do anything to hurt you.

562
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,442
I had to kill him. Because he hit you.
Do you understand that?

563
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:46,278
I did it for you.

564
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,697
I promise I will never do anything
to hurt you ever again.

565
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:53,911
I love you. I've loved you since
the first moment that I saw you.

566
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:03,546
Kristen. Kristen? Oh, no, no, no, don't.

567
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:05,714
Oh, no.

568
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,551
Oh, no.

569
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,096
No, no, no, no, no!

570
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,849
Please! Please, no!

571
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,185
No! No!

572
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:23,357
No!

573
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:07,318
No!

574
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,120
<i>Damn, this girl looks rough.</i>

575
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,957
They tell people she dead,
but that's a lie.

576
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,835
I heard the suit she was wearing
melted to her.

577
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:27,296
- They say she's fireproof.
- Come on.

578
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,131
Yeah, man. Fireproof.

579
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:33,886
That's why they sent her down here with
the rest of the monsters. For testing.

580
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:02,725
