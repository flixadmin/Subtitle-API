Ahh!

165
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Hostages en route

169
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,040
Circle back to Rumlow

What are you doing?

178
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,720
Backing up the hard drive.

179
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,280
It's a good habit
to get into.

180
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,520
Rumlow needed your help.

181
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,160
What the hell
are you doing here?

182
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,720
You're saving

Whatever I can
get my hands on.

184

Our mission is to
rescue hostages.

185
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,640
No, that's your mission,

186
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,600
and you've done
it beautifully.

187
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,560
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
I think that's
overstating things.

can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,720
FURY: I didn't lie.

198
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
Agent Romanoff
had a different
mission than yours.

199
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,840
Which you didn't
feel obliged to share.

200
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm not obliged
to do anything.

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,160
Those hostages
could have died, Nick.

202
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
I sent the greatest
soldier in history

203
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
to make sure
that didn't happen.

204
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,440
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

205
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

206
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Last time
I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

207
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,880
Look, I didn't want you
doing anything you
weren't comfortable with.

208
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,120
Agent Romanoff
is comfortable
with everything.

209
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't lead a mission

210
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

211
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
It's called
compartmentalization.

212
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Nobody spills the
secrets, because
nobody knows them all.

213
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,080
Except you.

214
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,160
You're wrong about me.

215
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
I do share.

216
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm nice like that.

Yeah.

224
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,560
My grandfather operated
one of these things
for 40 years.

225
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,440
Granddad worked
in a nice building.

226
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,920
Got good tips.

227
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,240
He'd walk home every
night, a roll of ones
stuffed in his lunch bag.

228
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,960
He'd say, "Hi."

229
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,200
People would say,
"Hi" back.

230
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,720
Time went on,
the neighborhood
got rougher.

231
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,800
He'd say, "Hi."

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,640
They'd say,
"Keep on steppin'."

233
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,480
Granddad got to
gripping that lunch bag
a little tighter.

234
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,200
Did he ever get mugged?

235
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,280
(LAUGHS)

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,000
Every week some
punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

237
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,240
What would he do?

238
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
He'd show them.

239
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,400
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

240
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

241
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,160
But he didn't
trust them very much.

242
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah, I know.

243
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,240
They're a little
bit bigger than a .22.

FURY: This is Project Insight.

synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

247
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,560
Launched from
the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

248
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

Stark?

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
He had
a few suggestions

252
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,400
once he got
an up-close look
at our old turbines.

253
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,280
These new long-range
precision guns

254
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,880
can eliminate 1,000
hostiles a minute.

255
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
The satellites can
read a terrorist's DNA

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
before he steps
outside his spider hole.

257
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,680
We're gonna
neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

258
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,840
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

259
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,320
We can't afford
to wait that long.

260
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,480
Who's "we"?

261
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,480
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

262
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,680
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

263
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,320
For once,
we're way ahead
of the curve.

264
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,320
By holding a gun
to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

265
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,040
You know,
I read those SSR files.

266
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,160
"Greatest Generation"?

267
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,440
You guys did
some nasty stuff.

268
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,760
Yeah, we compromised.

269
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,880
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,480
But we did it
so that people
could be free.

271
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,800
This isn't freedom.
This is fear.

272
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,440
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes
the world as it is, not
as we'd like it to be.

273
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,480
And it's getting
damn near past time

274
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,200
for you to get with
that program, Cap.

275

to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

A breach like this
raises serious questions.

357

he's Algerian.

360

361
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
I appreciate your wit,
Secretary Pierce.

362
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,960
But this Council takes
things like international
piracy fairly seriously.

363

Really? I don't.

I care about the fleet.

If this Council is
going to fall to rancor

366

every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

367
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,480
maybe we need
someone to oversee us.

would do it, too.

Nick, that's not a favor,

381
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
that's a sub-committee
hearing. A long one.

382
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

383
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,280
I just need time to
make sure it's nothing.

384

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,720
when I was
at State Department
in Bogota.

590
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,720
E.L.N. rebels
took the embassy,

591
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,920
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

592
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,480
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D.
station there,

593
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,320
and he comes to
me with a plan.

594
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,280
He wants to
storm the building
through the sewers.

595
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,280
I said,
"No, we'll negotiate."

596
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,720
Turned out, the E.L.N.
didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

597
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,120
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

598
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,360
They find it empty.

599
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,720
Nick had ignored
my direct order,

600
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,440
and carried out
an unauthorized

601
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
military operation
on foreign soil,

602
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,040

604
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
So you gave him a promotion.

605
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,640
I've never had any
cause to regret it.

606
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,320
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

607
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
I don't know.

608
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,760
Did you know it was bugged?

609
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,640
I did, because
Nick told me.

610
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,920
Did he tell you
he was the one
who bugged it?

611
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,400
I want you to see something.

612
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,400
INTERROGATOR:
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

613
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,680
Is that live?

614
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, they picked him up
last night

615
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,520
in a not-so-safe
house in Algiers.

616
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
ROGERS: Are you saying
he's a suspect?

617
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,800
Assassination
isn't Batroc's line.

618
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,720
PIERCE: No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

619
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,640
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

620
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,920
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

621
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,880
and then the money
was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

622
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,320
The last one going to
a holding company

623
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,560
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

624
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,200
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

625
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,680
Not likely.
Veech died six years ago.

626
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,040
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

627
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,200
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

628
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,560
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

629
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,560
The prevailing theory

630
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,560
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

631
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,960
and sale of
classified intelligence.

632
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,760
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

633
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,440
If you really knew
Nick Fury, you'd
know that's not true.

634
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,560
Why do you think
we're talking?

635
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,240
See, I took a seat
on the Council not
because I wanted to,

636
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,760
but because Nick
asked me to, because
we were both realists.

637
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,600
We knew that,
despite all the diplomacy

638
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,000
and the handshaking
and the rhetoric,

639
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,000
that to build
a really better world

640
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,600
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

641
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,720
And that makes enemies.

642
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Those people
that call you dirty
because you got the guts

643
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,840
to stick your hands
in the mud and try to
build something better.

644
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,440
And the idea
that those people
could be happy today

645
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,440
makes me really,
really angry.

646
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,200
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

647
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,920
I don't think
that's an accident.

648
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,280
And I don't think
you do, either.

649
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,360
So, I'm gonna ask again.

650
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,280
Why was he there?

651
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,280
He told me not
to trust anyone.

went straight over a cliff.

But the Winter Soldier
was there.

00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,640
I was covering my engineer

straight through me.

paper right here.

Well, he could explain how

this country is
expected to maintain
its national security

have laid waste to

that there are
some on this committee

who feel,
given your service record,

both for this country

that you belong

You're not going to
put me in a prison.

1618
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:32,640
You're not going
to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1619

Do enlighten us.

to Europe tonight.

if you'd come.

1632
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,640
There's something
I got to do first.

1633

How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man
with your abilities.

1634
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,920
I'm more of
a soldier than a spy.

1635
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,120
All right, then.

1636
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:05,080
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can
find me, right here.

1637
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,840
You should be honored.
That's about as
close as he gets

1638
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,160
to saying thank you.

1639
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,800
Not going with him?

1640
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,640
No.

1641
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,400
Not staying here.
Nah.

1642
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,760
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure
out a new one.

1643
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,160
That might take a while.

1644
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,840
I'm counting on it.

1645
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,560
That thing you asked for,

1646
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:29,000
I called in a few
favors from Kiev.

1647
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:34,840
Will you do me a favor?
Call that nurse.

1648
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,520
She's not a nurse.

1649
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,120
And you're not
a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1650
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,280
What was her name again?

1651
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,400
Sharon.

1652
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,560
She's nice.

1653
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,680
Be careful, Steve.

1654
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:00,000
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1655
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,480
You're going after him.

1656
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,960
You don't have
to come with me.

1657
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,200
I know.

1658
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,400
When do we start?

1659
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:22,920
It's over. Fury has
released everything
to the public.

1660
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,000
Everything he knows about.

1661
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,040
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1662
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:29,040
if they find out
we serve HYDRA...

1663
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,560
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1664
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,200
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1665
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,080
What we have

1666
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,480
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1667
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:50,720
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1668
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,640
there are other
facilities doing

1669
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,600
HYDRA's good work
around the world.

1670
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:02,440
We'll feed them
to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1671
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,240
and keep them
off our scent.

1672
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,480
What about the volunteers?

1673
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,760
The dead will
be buried so deep

1674
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,160
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1675
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:14,400
And the survivors?

1676
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,840
The twins.

1677
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:24,280
Sooner or later,
they will meet the twins.

1678
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,640
It's not a world
of spies anymore.

1679
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,200
Not even
a world of heroes.

1680
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,960
This is the age
of miracles, Doctor.

1681
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,800
There's nothing
more horrifying

1682
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,280
than a miracle.
