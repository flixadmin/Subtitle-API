1
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:42,456
Things are never
gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,792
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,394
You got aliens.

4
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:49,563
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:53,034
When I was a kid, I used
to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:57,538
Actually, it's native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,841
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,611
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,879
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,048
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,617
Yeah, well,

12
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,852
we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:37,411
No, hey! Ah!

14
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:40,014
You can't saw
through that stuff.

15
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,982
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:45,453
You gotta use
the stuff they use.

17
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:50,391
See? All right. All right.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,394
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,895
Glad you could join us.
Afternoon.

20
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,365
Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,735
Look, just go stack that armor
plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,570
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:03,904
Attention, please!

24
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:07,007
In accordance
with executive order 396b,

25
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,876
all post-battle
cleanup operations

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,511
are now under our jurisdiction.

27
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:13,481
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

28
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,882
Who the hell are you?

29
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,117
Qualified personnel.

30
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,452
Look, I have a city contract

31
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,421
to salvage all this, okay,
with the city, so--

32
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,758
I apologize, Mr. Toomes,
but all salvage operations

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,126
are now under our jurisdiction.

34
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,395
Please turn over any
and all exotic materials

35
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,898
that you've collected
or you will be prosecuted.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,433
Ma'am, what am--?

37
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:36,137
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

38
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,905
Look...

39
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,040
I bought trucks for this job.

40
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,542
I brought in a whole new crew.

41
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,978
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,414
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

43
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,884
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

44
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:53,487
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

45
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,657
What'd you say?

46
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:58,959
Yeah.

47
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,695
He's right.
I overextended myself.

48
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,031
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

49
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:08,469
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Put 'em down.

50
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,504
If you have a grievance,

51
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,506
you may take it up
with my superiors.

52
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,708
Your superiors.
Who the hell are they?

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,478
<i>A joint venture
between Stark industries</i>

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,079
<i>and the federal government,
the department</i>

55
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:21,115
<i>of damage control,
will oversee the collection</i>

56

<i>and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

57
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:27,555
Now the assholes who made this
mess are paid to clean it up.

58
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:28,756
Yeah, it's all rigged.

59
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:29,957
<i>Experts estimate there are</i>

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,059
<i>over 1500 tons
of exotic material</i>

61
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,029
<i>scattered throughout
the tri-state area.</i>

62
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,096
Hey, chief!

63
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,965
We still have another load
from yesterday.

64
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,900
We're supposed
to turn this in, right?

65
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:42,036
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.

66
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:46,807
We could have made some cool
stuff from all that alien junk.

67
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,544
I tell you what.

68
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,246
Let's keep it.

69
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:56,584
The world's changing.

70
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,555
It's time we change too.

71
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,269
There you go, Mason.

72
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,541
Yeah!

73
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,175
Business is good.

74
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:37,818
<i>- New York. Queens.
- It's a rough borough,</i>

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,054
<i>- but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?</i>

76
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,957
<i>No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.</i>

77
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,693
<i>- You can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

78
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,361
<i>Then why are you narrating
in that voice?</i>

79
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:50,698
<i>Uh, because it's fun. Fun.</i>

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,602
<i>So why do they call you happy?</i>

81
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,072
<i>Come on. I'm not carrying
your bags. Let's go.</i>

82
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,674
<i>Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?</i>

83
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,109
<i>There's a bathroom on it.</i>

84
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,845
<i>Whoa. No pilot? That's awesome.</i>

85
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,814
<i>Is that where you're gonna sit?
Yeah.</i>

86
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,116
<i>This is your first time
on a private plane?</i>

87
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,818
<i>My first time on any plane.</i>

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,321
<i>Should it--? Should it be--?
Should it be making that noise?</i>

89
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,190
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

90
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,931
<i>No one has actually told me</i>

91
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,333
<i>why I'm in Berlin
or what I'm doing.</i>

92
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,937
<i>Something about
captain America going crazy.</i>

93
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,239
<i>- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?</i>

94
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,708
<i>We're not roommates. Suit up.</i>

95
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,043
<i>Okay, Peter, you got this.</i>

96
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:37,845
<i>What the hell are you wearing?</i>

97
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,113
<i>It's my suit.</i>

98
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:40,981
<i>Where's the case? What case?</i>

99
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,716
<i>What? I thought
that was a closet.</i>

100
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:44,385
<i>- This is still my room?
- Go. Please.</i>

101
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,053
<i>My room is way bigger than--
There.</i>

102
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,656
<i>- I found the case.
- I found the case.</i>

103
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,258
<i>"A minor upgrade"?</i>

104
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,826
<i>Whoa.</i>

105
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,061
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

106
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,396
<i>Put it on. What the--?</i>

107
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,331
<i>This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--</i>

108
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,867
<i>Let's go.
But I don't understand.</i>

109
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:03,704
<i>Is it for me?
Happy. Happy, wait.</i>

110
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,239
<i>This is insane. Insane.</i>

111
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,341
<i>Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.</i>

112
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,777
<i>The greatest day of my life.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

113
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,147
<i>- Okay, there's captain America,
- iron man, black widow.</i>

114
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,349
<i>- Whoa. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!</i>

115
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:19,019
<i>Oh, that's me.
I gotta go. I gotta go.</i>

116
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,722
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

117
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,424
<i>Okay, so the craziest thing
just happened.</i>

118
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:25,325
<i>I just had a fight
with captain America.</i>

119
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,194
<i>I stole his shield.
I threw it at him--</i>

120
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:30,698
<i>What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.</i>

121
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:34,802
<i>It was the most amazing thing!</i>

122
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,336
<i>Mr. Stark was
like, "hey, underoos!"</i>

123
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,338
<i>I flipped in
and stole cap's shield.</i>

124
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
<i>I was like,
"what's up, everybody?"</i>

125
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,443
<i>And then-- hey, just a second!</i>

126
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:45,245
<i>Coming!</i>

127
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,480
<i>Hey.</i>

128
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,183
<i>We have thin walls here.</i>

129
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:52,219
<i>What are you doing,
a little video diary?</i>

130
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,954
<i>- Yeah.
- It's all right.</i>

131
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,956
<i>- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.</i>

132
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,925
<i>He was filming.
I'm gonna wipe the chip.</i>

133
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,493
<i>Okay. Hey. You know what?</i>

134
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,195
<i>We should make an alibi video</i>

135
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,896
<i>for your aunt anyway. You ready?</i>

136
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:05,933
<i>An alibi? Sure. Okay.
We rolling? Get in the frame.</i>

137
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:06,967
<i>Hey, May. How you doing?</i>

138
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,204
<i>What are you wearing?
Something skimpy, I hope.</i>

139
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,305
<i>Peter, that's inappropriate.</i>

140
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,440
<i>Let's start over.
You can edit it.</i>

141
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,142
<i>Three, two, one. Hey, May.</i>

142
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,911
<i>My gosh, I wanted to tell you</i>

143
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:20,447
<i>what an incredible job
your nephew did</i>

144
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,818
<i>this weekend at
the Stark internship retreat.</i>

145
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,353
<i>Everyone was impressed.</i>

146
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,989
<i>- Come on!
- It's a freaking merge. Sorry.</i>

147
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,158
<i>Because you're not
on queens boulevard.</i>

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,259
<i>See, Happy is hoping</i>

149
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,027
<i>to get bumped up
to asset management.</i>

150
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,497
<i>He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.</i>

151
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,198
<i>That was a private conversation.</i>

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,235
<i>I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.</i>

153
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,970
<i>No, seriously,
was he snoring a bunch?</i>

154
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:46,306
<i>- Here we are. End of the line.
- Whoops.</i>

155
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,909
<i>Can you give us a moment?
Want me to leave the car?</i>

156
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,411
<i>Grab Peter's case
out of the trunk.</i>

157
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,248
I can keep the suit?

158
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,018
Yes, we were
just talking about it.

159
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,052
Do me a favor, though.

160
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:00,521
Happy's kind of
your point guy on this.

161
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,890
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

162
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,325
I've seen his cardiogram.

163
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,060
All right? Yes.

164
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,195
Don't do anything I would do,

165
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,197
and don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

166
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,200
There's a little gray area
in there. Where you operate.

167
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,068
Wait, does that mean
I'm an avenger?

168
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,436
No.

169
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:18,038
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

170
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,473
I can take that.
You don't have to.

171
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,276
You'll take it?
Yeah, I can take that.

172
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,278
Thank you.

173
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,345
So when's our next--?

174
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,481
When's our next "retreat,"
you know?

175
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,448
What, next mission?

176
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,950
Yeah, the mission. The missions.

177
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,252
We'll call you.
Do you have my numbers?

178
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,353
No, I mean, we'll call you.

179
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,889
Like, someone
will call you. All right?

180
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,958
From your team. Okay. All right.

181
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,426
That's not a hug.
I'm just grabbing

182
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:43,163
the door for you.
We're not there yet.

183
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,432
Bye.

184
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:53,040
They're gonna call me.

185
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
What's up, penis Parker?

186
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,962
<i>Rise and shine,
midtown science and technology.</i>

187
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:51,531
<i>Students, don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

188
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,467
<i>Do you have a date
for homecoming?</i>

189
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:56,003
<i>Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.</i>

190
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:59,106
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

191
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:08,515
Damn it. You,
in my office right now.

192
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,435
Join me, and together

193
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,305
we'll build
my new Lego death star.

194
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,707
- What?
- So lame.

195
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,609
No way. That's awesome.
How many pieces?

196
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,945
Three thousand
eight hundred and three.

197
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,646
That's insane. I know.

198
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:41,081
You want to build it tonight?

199
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,983
No, I can't tonight.
I've got the Stark--

200
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,319
Mm-hm. Stark internship.
Yeah, exactly.

201
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,620
Always got that internship.

202
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,688
Yeah, well, hopefully,

203
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,523
soon it'll lead
to a real job with them.

204
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,024
That would be so sweet. Right?

205
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:54,127
He'd be all, "good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

206
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,262
Here's a gold coin."

207
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,532
I don't know how jobs work.
That's exactly how they work.

208
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:02,436
I'll knock out the basic bones
of the death star at my place.

209
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:03,470
I'll come by afterwards.

210
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,739
For the most part, the difficult
thing is the base of it.

211
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,309
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

212
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,180
That'd be great.

213
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,414
I'm gonna be late!

214
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,083
Okay, so how do we calculate

215
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:20,687
linear acceleration
between points a and b?

216
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,421
Flash.

217
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,323
It's the product
of sine of the angle

218
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,691
and gravity divided by the mass.

219
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:27,260
Nope. Peter.

220
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,029
You still with us?

221
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,765
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.

222
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,632
Uh...

223
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:36,036
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

224
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,771
Right. See, Flash,
being the fastest

225
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,040
isn't always the best
if you are wrong.

226
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,776
You're dead.

227
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,383
Today we're talking about
Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

228
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,652
but trust me,
there's nothing Bohr-ing

229
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:56,757
about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

230
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,201
- Did Liz get a new top?
- No.

231
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,505
We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

232
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:14,374
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

233
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,611
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

234
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:20,680
Too late. You guys are losers.

235
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:23,250
Well, then why
do you sit with us?

236
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,252
Because I don't have
any friends.

237
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,722
Let's move to the next question.

238
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,458
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

239
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,560
Hydrogen's the lightest.

240
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,596
That's not
the question. Okay. Yeah.

241
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,431
Uranium.

242
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,832
That is correct.
Thank you, Abraham.

243
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,501
Yes. Open your books to page 10.

244
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,403
Peter, it's nationals.

245
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,605
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

246
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,408
I can't go to Washington.
If Mr. Stark needs me,

247
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,709
I have to make sure I'm here.

248
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:52,679
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

249
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,147
Wait. What's happening?

250
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,582
Peter's not going to Washington.

251
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,452
No. No, no, no. Why not?

252
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,087
Really? Right before nationals?

253
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,124
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

254
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

255
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,428
Flash, you're in for Peter.

256
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,131
- I don't know.
- I gotta check my calendar first.

257
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,834
I got a hot date
with black widow coming up.

258
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,235
That is false.

259
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:20,373
What'd I tell you about using
the bell for comedic purposes?

260
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:38,125
Hey, what's up? Hey, man.

261
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,461
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

262
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,896
Hey, Mr. Parker.

263
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,397
Number five, right?

264
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,465
Yeah, and with pickles,

265
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,168
and can you smush it down
real flat? Thanks.

266
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,569
You got it, boss.

267
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,604
How's your aunt?

268
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,306
Yeah, she's all right.

269
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,550
Ten dollars. It's $5.

270
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:04,618
For that comment, $10.

271
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,388
Hey, come on.
I'm joking. I'm joking.

272
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,223
Here's $5.

273
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,826
What's up, Murph?

274
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,562
How you doing, buddy?

275
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,330
So how's school?

276
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,699
Ah, you know. It's boring.
Got better things to do.

277
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,701
Stay in school, kid.
Stay in school.

278
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,637
Otherwise,
you're gonna end up like me.

279
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,341
This is great.
Best sandwiches in queens.

280
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,845
Finally.

281
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:43,250
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter with you?

282
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,453
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

283
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:50,523
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

284
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,426
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

285
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:56,396
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

286
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,602
Everybody good?

287
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:08,842
Hey!

288
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:12,045
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?

289
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,380
Call me spider-man!

290
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,783
Okay, spider-man. Do a flip.

291
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,886
Yeah! Not bad.

292
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Hey, buddy.

293
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,771
Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
It's my car, dumbass!

294
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,039
Hey! Shut that off!

295
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,074
Can you tell him it's my car?
I was just--

296
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,344
Yo! I work at nights. Come on.
That's not your car!

297
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,945
That's his car.
How was I supposed to know?

298
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:48,682
He put that in the window!
Every day with these alarms!

299
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:52,385
Turn it off!
Don't make me come down there.

300
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,754
Hey, Gary! How you doing?

301
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:57,590
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

302
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:04,931
I'm good, I'm good.

303
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:08,435
<i>You have reached
the voicemail box of:</i>

304
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:09,936
<i>Happy Hogan.</i>

305
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,572
- Hey, Happy.
- Here's my report for tonight.

306
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:13,940
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

307
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,776
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

308
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:17,610
Um...

309
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:19,979
I helped this lost,
old Dominican lady.

310
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,683
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

311
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,453
I just feel like
I could be doing more.

312
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,488
You know? Just curious
when the next

313
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,989
real mission's gonna be.

314
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,826
So, yeah, just call me back.

315
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:36,096
It's Peter. Parker.

316
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:43,036
Why would I tell him
about the churro?

317
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,943
Oh. Unh. Hey, hey. Oh! Ah.

318
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,781
Okay.

319
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,783
Can't wait to see this thing.

320
00:18:56,785 --> 00:19:00,520
Finally, something good.

321
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,990
Yo, this high-tech stuff
makes it too easy.

322
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:08,061
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

323
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,532
Oh, heh, nice.

324
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:16,870
We can hit, like,
five more places tonight.

325
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:27,680
Ahem. What's up, guys?

326
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:29,783
You forget your pin number?

327
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:30,917
Whoa! You're the avengers.

328
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,953
What are you guys doing here?

329
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,691
Thor. Hulk. Good to
finally meet you guys.

330
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,860
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron man.

331
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:45,698
Hey, what are you doing robbing
a bank? You're a billionaire.

332
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:48,535
Hey--

333
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,571
Oh, this feels so weird.

334
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,674
What is that thing?

335
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:59,979
I'm starting... To think...
You're not... The avengers.

336
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,184
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

337
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:07,754
Uh, spider-man is
fighting the avengers

338
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,922
in a bank on 21st street.

339
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:13,226
- All right, let's wrap this up.
- It's a school night.

340
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,232
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

341
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:23,102
No. Wait, wait, wait! Ah!

342
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,908
Mr. Delmar.

343
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,179
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

344
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:44,657
Oh, come on.

345
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,760
I gotta--

346
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,997
Here, here. Good, yeah.

347
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,633
Okay. Good. Yes.

348
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:54,968
Yes-- no. No, put that down.

349
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,837
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?

350
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,106
Happy, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

351
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,641
These guys were robbing an ATM

352
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:04,210
with high-tech weapons--
Take a breath. I don't have time

353
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,212
for ATM robberies <i>yeah, but--</i>

354
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,780
Or the notes you leave behind.

355
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:09,115
I have moving day
to worry about.

356
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:11,017
<i>Everything's gotta be out
by next week.</i>

357
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,553
Wait, wait. You're moving?
Who's moving?

358
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,188
Yeah, don't you watch the news?

359
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,556
Tony sold avengers tower.

360
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,224
We're relocating
to a new facility upstate

361
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,727
where hopefully the cell
service is much worse.

362
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,096
But what about me?
What about you?

363
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:26,900
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

364
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,002
<i>Can I just please talk
to Mr. Stark?</i>

365
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,537
Stay away
from anything dangerous.

366
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,674
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

367
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:37,544
I am responsible. I-- oh, crap.

368
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,179
<i>My backpack's gone.</i>
That doesn't sound responsible.

369
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:44,317
<i>I'll call you back.</i>
Feel free not to.

370
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:46,012
What was that?

371
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,748
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

372
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,216
You're the spider-man.

373
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,785
From YouTube. I'm not. I'm not.

374
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:55,288
You were on the ceiling.
What are you doing in my room?

375
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,757
May let me in. We were gonna
finish the death star.

376
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,859
You can't just bust
into my room!

377
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,762
That Turkey meatloaf recipe
is a disaster.

378
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:06,132
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

379
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,834
Yes. No. He's got a thing.

380
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:10,837
A thing to do after.

381
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,839
Okay.

382
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,009
Maybe put on some clothes.

383
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,944
Oh, she doesn't know?
Nobody knows.

384
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,647
Mr. Stark knows because
he made my suit. That's it.

385
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,251
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an avenger?

386
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,053
Yeah, basically.

387
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,856
Oh, geez.
You can't tell anybody.

388
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,190
You gotta keep it a secret.

389
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,026
Secret? Why?
You know what she's like.

390
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,727
If she finds out people
try and kill me

391
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:36,929
every night,
she won't let me do this.

392
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,297
Come on, Ned, please.

393
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,166
Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,668
I'll level with you.

395
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,769
I can't keep this a secret.

396
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,404
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

397
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,407
Ned, May cannot know. I cannot
do that to her right now.

398
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,175
You know? I mean, everything

399
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,412
that's happened
with her, i-- please.

400
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:57,083
Okay. Just swear it, okay?

401
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,251
I swear.

402
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:00,053
Thank you. Yeah.

403
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:02,255
I can't believe
this is happening now.

404
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,456
Can I try the suit on? No.

405
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,725
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

406
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:08,261
I'm gonna tell you tomorrow.
Great.

407
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:09,962
Okay, well, wait, then.

408
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:14,400
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

409
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:17,336
This is the Stark internship.

410
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:18,438
Ohh...

411
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,207
Just get out of here.

412
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,944
<i>What's the matter?</i>

413
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:27,146
Thought you loved larb.

414
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:29,282
It's too larby?

415
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,484
Not larby enough.

416
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:35,188
How many times do I have
to say "larb" before...

417
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,956
You talk to me?

418
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,491
You know I larb you.

419
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:42,462
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

420
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,796
A lot of work.

421
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:45,398
The Stark internship.

422
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,168
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

423
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,772
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

424
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:56,008
<i>Delmar's sandwiches destroyed...</i>

425
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,376
What does he have you doing?

426
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:58,978
You need to use your instincts.

427
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,147
<i>...after an ATM robbery
was thwarted</i>

428
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,983
<i>by queens' own crime stopper,</i>
what?

429
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:04,951
<i>The spider-man.</i>

430
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,487
<i>As the spider-man attempted
to foil their heist,</i>

431
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,122
<i>a powerful blast was set off,</i>

432
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,357
<i>slicing through
the bodega across the street.</i>

433
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,426
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

434
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,895
If you spot something
like that happening,

435
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:17,964
you turn and you run
the other way.

436
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,266
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

437
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,801
Six blocks away from us.

438
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:24,437
I need a new backpack.

439
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,440
What? I need a new backpack.

440
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,809
That's five.

441
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:32,879
Sticky rice pudding.
We didn't order that.

442
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,014
It's on the house.

443
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,850
Oh. Thanks.

444
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:40,820
That's nice of him.

445
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:44,023
I think he larbs you.

446

<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

447
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:47,927
Can it bite me?

448
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,495
Well, it probably
would've hurt, right?

449
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:52,498
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

450
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,801
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

451
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,470
The spider's dead, Ned.

452
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,141
Whoa.

453
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,446
You were here?

454
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:10,116
Yeah.

455
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,885
You could've died.

456
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:16,889
Do you lay eggs?

457
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:19,225
What? No.

458
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:23,162
Can you spit venom? No.

459
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,199
Can you summon
an army of spiders?

460
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,033
No, Ned.

461
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,969
The Sokovia accords
were put into place...

462
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,438
How far can you shoot your webs?

463
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,407
It's unknown. Shut up.

464
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,441
To begin regulating...

465
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:37,510
If I was you,
I would stand on a building

466
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:41,581
and shoot as far as I could--
Shut up, Ned.

467
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:42,615
<i>Hi. I'm captain America.</i>

Yeah, we met.

00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,430
Thank you, captain.

474
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:00,466
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

475
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,869
It's required by the state.
Let's do it.

476
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,004
Do avengers have to pay taxes?

477
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,138
What does hulk smell like?

478
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,007
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

479
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,544
Is captain America cool, or is
he like a mean, old grandpa?

480
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,446
Ned, just shh, okay?

481
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:16,449
Hey, can I be your guy
in the chair?

482
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:17,250
What?

483
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,986
Yeah. You know how
there's a guy with a headset

484
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:21,387
telling the other guy
where to go?

485
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,891
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

486
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,526
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

487
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:29,128
I could be your guy
in the chair.

488
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,397
Ned, I don't need
a guy in the chair.

489
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,033
Looking good, Parker.

490
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:38,638
Now, see, for me,
it would be f Thor

491
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,606
marry iron man and kill hulk.

492
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,575
Well, what about the spider-man?

493
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,043
It's just spider-man.

494
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,245
See the bank security
cam on YouTube?

495
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,280
He fought off four guys.

496
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:50,082
Oh, my god, she's
crushing on spider-man.

497
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:50,983
No way.

498
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,286
Kind of. Oh, gross.

499
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:54,987
He's probably, like, 30.

500
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,422
You don't know
what he looks like.

501
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,623
What if he's seriously burned?

502
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,260
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

503
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,096
Peter knows spider-man.

504
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:09,435
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--

505
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,336
They're friends.

506
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,673
Yeah, like coach Wilson
and captain America are friends.

507
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:17,043
I've met him, yeah.
A couple times.

508
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,244
But it's...

509
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:21,647
Through the Stark internship.

510
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,450
Yeah, well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it.

511
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,419
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

512
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,288
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

513
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,424
Yeah, um, I'm having
people over tonight.

514
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,959
You're more
than welcome to come.

515
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,094
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

516
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:38,431
You should totally invite
your personal friend spider-man.

517
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,632
Um... It's okay.

518
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,069
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

519
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,471
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

520
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:53,446
What are you doing?

521
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:55,081
Helping you out.

522
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,649
Did you not hear her?

523
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,518
Liz has a crush on you.

524
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:03,222
Dude, you're an avenger.

525
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:08,461
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

526
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:13,265
House party in the suburbs.

527
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:16,669
Oh, I remember these.
Kind of jealous.

528
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,538
It'll be a night to remember.
Oh...

529
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,508
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

530
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,211
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
Hm.

531
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,412
This is a mistake.

532
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:28,114
Hey, let's just go home.

533
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,115
Oh, Peter.

534
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:32,051
I know. I know it's really hard

535
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,153
trying to fit in
with all the changes

536
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:35,721
your body's going through.

537
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:37,123
It's flowering now.

538
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,793
He's so stressed out lately.

539
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,762
What helps
with stress is a party.

540
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:44,030
We should go to the party.

541
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,732
Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

542
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,301
Peter...

543
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:52,338
Have fun, okay? Okay. I will.

544
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,673
Bye, May.

545
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:57,276
Dude, you have the suit, right?

546
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,179
Yeah.
This is gonna change our lives.

547
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:07,186
Annie, over here!

548
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,488
Hey. Hey.

549
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:13,826
<i>DJ Flash.</i>

550
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:16,595
Okay. We're gonna have
spider-man swing in,

551
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,497
say you guys
are tight, and I get

552
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:20,433
a fist bump or one
of those half bro-hugs.

553
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,335
Can't believe you're
at this lame party.

554
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:26,072
But you're here too.

555
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,340
Am I?

556
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:30,843
Oh, my gosh.

557
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,212
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

558
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:34,814
Hi, Liz. Hi, Liz.

559
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:36,649
I'm so happy you guys came.

560
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:40,386
There's pizza
and drinks. Help yourself.

561
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:42,822
What a great party. Thanks.

562
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,459
Oh, i--

563
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:50,096
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--

564
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,797
Yeah. Have fun.

565
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,666
- Bye.
- Bye.

566
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,668
Dude, what are you doing?

567
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,570
She's here. Spider it up.

568
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,506
No, no, no. I can't--
I cannot do this.

569
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:03,175
Spider-man is not
a party trick, okay?

570
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:06,278
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

571
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,181
Peter, no one wants that.

572
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,483
Dude.

573
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:13,752
Penis Parker, what's up?

574
00:31:13,754 --> 00:31:15,254
So where's your pal spider-man?

575
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:18,224
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

576
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:21,460
That's not spider-man.

577
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,631
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

578
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,205
"Hey, what's up? I'm spider-man.

579
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:36,475
"Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

580
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,512
"Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

581
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:42,214
He must be around..."

582
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,688
God, this is stupid.
What am I doing?

583
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:59,365
What the hell?

584
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:07,640
Whoo!

585
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,521
This sucks.

586
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,457
Whoo!

587
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,661
Now, this is crafted
from a reclaimed

588
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:31,530
sub-Ultron arm
straight from Sokovia.

589
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,532
Here. You try.

590
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,467
Man, I wanted something low-key.

591
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:36,902
Why are you trying
to upsell me, man?

592
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,438
Okay, okay. I got
what you need, all right?

593
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,908
I got tons of
great stuff here. One sec.

594
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,546
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
chitauri railguns...

595
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,682
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

596
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,218
Look, times are changing.
We're the only ones

597
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,586
selling these high-tech weapons.

598
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:57,323
Oh, this must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

599
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:58,891
I need something
to stick up somebody.

600
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,261
I'm not trying to shoot them
back in time.

601
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,730
I got antigrav climbers.

602
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,732
Yo, climbers?

603
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,602
Okay, what the hell is that?

604
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:14,540
Did you set us up?
Hey, hey, man.

605
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:20,379
Hey! Come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

606
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,715
All right.

607
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,929
What was that?

608
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:45,371
What--?

609
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:50,609
We gotta call him.
No, no, no, no.

610
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:57,049
Did you just do it again?

611
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:59,718
Shut up. I'm calling him.

612
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:09,561
Toomes's phone.

613
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,499
Boss.

614
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,634
Oh, my butt!

615
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:37,323
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

616
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,093
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

617
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:43,729
Hey, hey, buddy.

618
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:47,066
Sorry, no time to play.
Here, go fetch.

619
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,467
Whoo!

620
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,737
Now, this is more like it.

621
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,381
Whoa!

622
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:04,817
Smells really good.

623
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,422
Great movie!

624
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,563
Oh, hey, guys.

625
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,631
No! No!

626
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:23,635
<i>- Hey, it's Peter.
- Leave a message.</i>

627
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:24,737
Peter, where are you?

628
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:27,639
The hat's not working.
This is not cool.

629
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:30,943
Almost got you.

630
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:45,023
Thought you got away
from me, didn't you?

631
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:47,726
I got you
right where I want you.

632
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,496
Surprise!

633
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,901
What the hell?

634
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:44,917
Oh, hey.

635
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:49,988
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster

636
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,157
and picked me up, and took me up

637
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,859
like a thousand feet
and just dropped me.

638
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,962
How'd you find me? Did you put
a tracker in my suit?

639
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,665
I put everything in your suit.

640
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,500
Including this heater.

641
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:03,669
Whoa.

642
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:07,506
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?

643
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,209
The guy with wings is
the source of the weapons.

644
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:11,643
I gotta take him down.

645
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:12,878
Take him down now, huh?

646
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,081
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

647
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,616
The avengers? No, no, no.

648
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:19,017
This is a little below
their pay grade.

649
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,753
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.

650
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,055
I had that. I was fine.

651
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:26,525
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

652
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,161
Thank god this place has Wi-Fi

653
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,896
or you would be toast right now.

654
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,631
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

655
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:33,932
Cheers.

656
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:36,802
<i>Look, forget the flying
vulture guy, please.</i>

657
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,036
Why? <i>Why?</i>

658
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,905
Because I said so!

659
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:43,509
Sorry, I'm talking
to a teenager.

660
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,576
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

661
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:46,278
<i>Build up your game helping
the little people,</i>

662
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,882
like that lady that
bought you the churro.

663
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:53,051
Can't you just be a friendly

664
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,186
neighborhood spider-man?

665
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,054
But I'm ready
for more than that now.

666
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,590
<i>No, you're not.</i>
That is not what you thought

667
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:00,859
when I took on captain America.
<i>Trust me, kid.</i>

668
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,995
<i>If cap wanted to lay you out,
he would've.</i>

669
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,796
<i>Listen to me. If you come across</i>

670
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,598
<i>these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

671
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,534
Are you driving?

672
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,838
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

673
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,275
I got some pull
at MIT. End call.

674
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:17,643
No, I don't need to go to--

675
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:21,680
<i>Mr. Stark is
no longer connected.</i>

676
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:25,250
That's awesome.

677
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:31,056
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

678
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,568
Whoa.

679
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,143
Hey, man, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

680
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,678
Actually, I was calling to say

681
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,146
maybe you shouldn't come.
Listen to this.

682
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:57,015
When I say "penis,"
you say "Parker."

683
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,216
- Penis!
- Parker!

684
00:38:58,218 --> 00:38:59,585
- Penis!
- Parker!

685
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,321
<i>- Sorry, Peter.
- I guess we're still losers.</i>

686
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:03,589
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

687
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,592
I'll see you tomorrow in school.

688
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:34,886
Whoa.

689
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,266
Idiots.

690
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:49,735
Idiots.

691
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,136
Idiots!

692
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,840
Boss? Your wife
keeps texting you.

693
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,174
Something about a brake light.

694
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:58,343
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

695
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:00,112
Oh. Sorry. You left it out.

696
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:03,148
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

697
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,653
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

698
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,154
Huh? In case you want to,

699
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,390
you know, go for the big one?

700
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:14,092
You're still on that?
I told you, no.

701
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:16,028
The answer's no. Forget it.

702
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,268
Ha, ha, ha! Whoo!

703
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:30,809
I mean, that was badass.

704
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,112
How many times have I told you

705
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:35,881
not to fire them
out in the open?

706
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:39,251
You said, move the merchandise.
Under the radar.

707
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:40,452
Under the radar!

708
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,187
That's how we survive.

709
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,789
If you bring damage control

710
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,991
or the avengers down here,
we're through.

711
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,893
You're out there wearing
that goofy thing,

712
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,996
lighting up cars
calling yourself the shocker.

713
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:52,931
"I'm the shocker.
I shock people."

714
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:54,299
What is this, pro wrestling?

715
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:57,235
Whatever, old man. Come on.

716
00:40:58,104 --> 00:40:59,838
Look.

717
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,405
Look.

718
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:04,042
I know you don't give
a crap about anything.

719
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,711
But I do.

720
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,745
I built this whole place

721
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,447
because I got people
I have to look after.

722
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:13,051
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:15,721
You know what?

724
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,490
I can't afford your bullshit.

725
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:20,158
Get out of here. What?

726
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,993
You're done.
You're off the crew.

727
00:41:21,995 --> 00:41:24,329
Yeah, all right.

728
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:25,297
Heh. All right.

729
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:28,266
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

730
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:30,969
With everything I know.

731
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:33,972
Excuse me? I'm just saying,

732
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:35,474
maybe your wife
would like to know

733
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:38,810
where you really get
your money from.

734
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,846
You know what? What?

735
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:41,947
You're right.

736
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:44,950
That work? I don't know.

737
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,351
I can't afford that.

738
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:48,887
W-w-wait.

739
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:58,096
Damn.

740
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:01,399
I thought this was
the antigravity gun.

741
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:04,970
What? No, that's that one.

742
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:18,984
Here.

743
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:20,318
Now you're the shocker.

744
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,555
Go out there and find
that weapon he lost.

745
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,423
All right.

746
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:35,367
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

747
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:37,836
Yeah, well, something came up.

748
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:38,837
Oh, what is that?

749
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,240
I don't know. Some guy tried
to vaporize me with it.

750
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:44,209
Seriously? Yeah.

751
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:44,976
Awesome.

752
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:48,580
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

753
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:51,349
So scary. Yeah.

754
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,553
Well, look, I think
it's a power source.

755
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:57,589
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

756
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:59,157
That's an inductive
charging plate.

757
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,193
That's what I use
to charge my toothbrush.

758
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:02,460
Whoever's making these weapons

759
00:43:02,462 --> 00:43:04,062
is combining
alien tech with ours.

760
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:08,834
That is literally the coolest
sentence anyone has ever said.

761
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,868
I just want to thank you

762
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,003
for letting me be
part of your journey

763
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:15,240
into this amazing--

764
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:20,946
Keep your fingers
clear of the blades.

765
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:23,348
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

766
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,985
We'll go to the lab after class
and run some tests.

767
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:29,087
Let's do it.

768
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,162
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

769
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:40,866
We gotta come up with a better
name than "glowy thingy."

770
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,501
You're right.

771
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:44,236
Crap.

772
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:47,305
Come on, come on, come on.

773
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:52,010
High schools creep me out.

774
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:54,312
They got this funny smell,
you know what I mean?

775
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:58,250
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

776
00:43:58,252 --> 00:43:59,251
What? Yeah.

777
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,485
We gotta get out of here.

778
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:02,320
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

779
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:04,890
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

780
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,660
Someone dropped you in a lake?
Yeah, it was not good.

781
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:11,429
Peter-- no. Stay there, Ned.

782
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,665
Peter.

783
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,903
What are you doing?

784
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,104
Nothing.

785
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,406
Yeah. You good?

786
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,208
Chess.

787
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:26,912
Man, can you imagine
what the boss would say

788
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,179
if he knew where we were?

789
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:30,315
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

790
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:32,250
There's no sign of the weapon.

791
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,020
And even if it was here,
now it's gone.

792
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:37,923
So are we.

793
00:45:08,254 --> 00:45:11,156
This is so awesome.

794
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:14,059
I know, right?

795
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,230
They're in Brooklyn.

796
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:24,970
Staten island.

797
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:32,544
Leaving Jersey.

798
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,253
They stopped.

799
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:44,155
Huh.

800
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:45,056
Maryland?

801
00:45:45,058 --> 00:45:47,592
What's there? I don't know.

802
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:48,460
Evil lair?

803
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:50,628
They have a lair?
Dude, a gang with alien guns

804
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,598
run by a guy with wings?
Yeah, they have a lair.

805
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,399
Badass.

806
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:58,603
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

807
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:03,008
It's not too far from D.C.

808
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,609
Hey, it's Peter. Guys.

809
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:05,710
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

810
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,779
Yeah, I was hoping I could
rejoin the team.

811
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:09,647
No, no way.
You can't quit on us,

812
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:12,584
stroll up and be
welcomed back by everyone.

813
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:13,718
Hey, welcome back, Peter!

814
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,620
Flash, you're back
to first alternate.

815
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:17,122
What? He's taking your place.

816
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:18,423
Excuse me, can we go already?

817
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:20,325
I was hoping to get in
some light protesting

818
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:22,293
in front of one
of the embassies before dinner.

819
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:26,297
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

820
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:28,066
<i>Focus up, everyone.</i>

821
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:30,435
<i>Our next topic
is the moons of Saturn.</i>

822
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:33,104
Second law of thermodynamics.

823
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,706
Frank Sinatra. Fort Sumter.

824
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,242
Flash is wrong.
Okay, guys, let's focus.

825
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,144
Next one.
Liz, don't overwork 'em.

826
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:41,446
Uh, strontium, barium,
vibranium.

827
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:43,782
Very good, Peter.
Glad to have you back.

828
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:46,117
Glad to be back.

829
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,752
What is the current
standard unit of--?

830
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,088
Can I take this real quick?
I'll only be a sec.

831
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,356
Yeah, fine. Hello?

832
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,092
Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?

833
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:55,660
Okay, focus up, everyone.
Tracker.

834
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:58,563
Yeah, it's just a school trip.
It's nothing.

835
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,697
Look, Happy, I gotta say,

836
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,232
you tracking me
without permission

837
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:03,301
is a complete violation
of my privacy.

838
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:04,836
That's different.
What's different?

839
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,806
Nothing. Look, it's just
the academic decathlon.

840
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:09,240
<i>It's no big deal.</i> Hey, hey.

841
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:12,210
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

842
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:14,312
Sounds like it's no big deal,

843
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:16,314
but remember, I'm watching you.

844
00:47:26,725 --> 00:47:29,761
Everyone stick together. Yeah.

845
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,130
You kidding me?
This place is huge.

846
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:34,666
I've seen bigger.
There's a bird in here.

847
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,669
Hey, you brought
your laptop, right?

848
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:39,404
Why?

849
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:47,545
Peter,

850
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:50,882
why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

851
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,318
Uh, because
I gotta follow these guys

852
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,120
to their boss
before they move again

853
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,690
and I don't really want
Mr. Stark to know about it.

854
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:01,126
So you're lying to iron man now?

855
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,193
No, I'm not lying.

856
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:06,197
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

857
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:10,902
Oh, gotcha.

858
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:16,708
All right, Happy,
enjoy tracking this lamp.

859
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:21,546
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here.

860
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:22,247
Hm?

861
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:26,251
But they're all disabled
by the training wheels protocol.

862
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:26,784
What?

863
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:29,754
"Training wheels protocol"?

864
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:30,655
Turn it off.

865
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,557
I don't think
that's a good idea.

866
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,925
They're blocked for a reason.

867
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,161
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.

868
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,763
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

869
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:40,865
It's not cool.
But you are a kid.

870
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,368
Yeah, a kid who can stop
a bus with his bare hands.

871
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,570
Peter, I just don't think
this is a great idea.

872
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:47,939
I mean, what if this is illegal?

873
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:48,873
Look, please.

874
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,708
This is my chance
to prove myself.

875
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,410
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

876
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,612
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

877
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:55,747
The guy in the chair.

878
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:58,783
Don't do that. Come on.

879
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,300
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe, all right?

880
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,468
Okay. Okay.

881
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,238
They're moving. Be careful.

882
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,976
Hey, Liz. Perfect timing.

883
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:26,444
We're gonna go swimming.

884
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:28,346
Come on, come on. What?

885
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,683
Hey, Peter. Hi.

886
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:33,484
Hey.

887
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:37,889
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.

888
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,357
Peter, you don't need to study.

889
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,392
You're, like, the smartest guy
I've ever met.

890
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:43,728
And besides,
a rebellious group activity

891
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,764
the day before competition
is good for morale.

892
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:47,532
Hm?

893
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:49,701
Well, I read that
in a Ted talk, so--

894
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:52,370
I-- I heard it in a Ted talk.

895
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:53,805
And I read a coaching book.

896
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:57,775
Are you really--
This is really important to you.

897
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:59,744
Yeah. It's our future.

898
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,846
I'm not gonna screw it up.

899
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:03,548
Besides, we raided the minibar

900
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,683
and these candy bars were,
like, $11.

901
00:50:05,685 --> 00:50:08,853
So get your trunks on
and come on.

902
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:09,687
Come on.

903
00:50:09,689 --> 00:50:11,956
Come on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

904
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,258
Let's go.

905
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:38,316
<i>Good evening, Peter.</i>

906
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:39,350
Hello? Hello?

907
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:40,485
<i>Congratulations on completing</i>

908
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:42,053
<i>the rigorous
training wheels protocol</i>

909
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:44,822
<i>and gaining access to
your suit's full capabilities.</i>

910
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:45,990
Ah, thank you.

911
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:48,059
<i>So, where would you like
to take me tonight?</i>

912
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:51,729
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

913
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:53,398
<i>Tracker located.</i>

914
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,933
<i>Plotting course
to intercept target.</i>

915
00:50:55,935 --> 00:50:57,635
Okay, well, as long
as I make it back

916
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,571
in time for decathlon,
it's fine.

917
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:10,682
<i>One hundred meters
from destination and closing.</i>

918
00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:12,917
<i>Jump now.</i>

919
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:18,523
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

920
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,825
Why is their secret lair

921
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,028
in a gas station?
That's so lame.

922
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:28,099
Hey, suit lady,
what are they doing?

923
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,034
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

924
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:32,537
I can hear what
they're saying? Uh, yeah.

925
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,405
<i>Activating enhanced
reconnaissance mode.</i>

926
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,841
<i>I got the gauntlet
from the Lagos cleanup.</i>

927
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,609
<i>The rest is my design.</i>
Whoa, that's so cool.

928
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:41,813
<i>Can't believe they're still
cleaning the Triskelion mess.</i>

929
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:43,948
<i>- I love it.
- They keep making messes,</i>

930
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,983
<i>- we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.</i>

931
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:47,752
Whoa, they're in the middle
of a heist.

932
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:50,388
I could catch 'em all
red-handed. This is awesome.

933
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,823
Okay, I'm gonna
get a little closer

934
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:53,358
so I can see what's happening.

935
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,927
<i>Would you like me
to engage enhanced combat mode?</i>

936
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,596
"Enhanced combat mode"? Yeah.

937
00:51:58,598 --> 00:51:59,797
<i>Activating instant kill.</i>

938
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,433
No, no, no, no. I don't want
to kill anybody.

939
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:05,703
<i>Deactivating instant kill.</i>

940
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:08,840
Did you hear that?

941
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:11,008
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

942
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,446
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

943
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,515
Suit lady, what's wrong
with my web-shooters?

944
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:20,785
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for enhanced combat mode.</i>

945
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:22,120
Why would I need rapid-fire?

946
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:23,888
<i>Would you like to see
more options?</i>

947
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,891
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

948
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,860
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

949
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:29,894
You two wait right here.

950
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,929
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers

951
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,798
or that thing will
shatter your arm.

952
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,700
All right, where's the dampers?

953
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:37,068
That one. <i>Great choice.</i>

954
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,472
<i>Would you like me to set this
as your new default?</i>

955
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,141
No, no, no. Push that in.

956
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:44,509
Right here? No, the other--

957
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:45,743
This one here? Yeah, push it.

958
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,845
What was that? <i>Taser webs.</i>

959
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:49,514
Taser webs?
I don't want taser webs.

960
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:52,417
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

961
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,819
<i>Would you like to run
a refresher course?</i>

962
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,654
No. Just-- you choose.
<i>Sure thing.</i>

963
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:59,957
<i>Six-Alpha-niner,
are you running on time?</i>

964
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:04,962
Copy, central.
Six-Alpha-niner on schedule.

965
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:09,700
<i>I got a visual.</i>
Green light, green light.

966
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,606
Oh, that's him.

967
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:20,011
<i>Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.</i>

968
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:22,914
<i>Pulling in behind the caboose.</i>

969
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:26,717
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

970
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:37,929
<i>Dropping down.</i>

971
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:42,500
No outgoing distress signals.
You're all clear.

972
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:47,705
<i>Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.</i>

973
00:53:54,012 --> 00:53:55,213
Whoa, cool.

974
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:58,950
It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

975
00:54:02,054 --> 00:54:05,556
<i>All right, coming up.</i>

976
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:13,564
Hey, big bird!
This doesn't belong to you.

977
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,800
Oh, god.

978
00:54:20,973 --> 00:54:24,609
Suit lady, what was that?
<i>You told me to choose.</i>

979
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:27,912
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

980
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:31,816
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

981
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:47,632
Oh, my head.

982
00:54:47,634 --> 00:54:51,636
<i>You appear to have
a mild concussion.</i>

983
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:56,541
Hey, so where am I right now?

984
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,208
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

985
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,245
<i>The container walls
are hindering my sensors.</i>

986
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,147
Wait a minute.

987
00:55:03,149 --> 00:55:04,715
They must have
hijacked the truck

988
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:06,884
and taken me to their evil lair.

989
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,253
Okay, suit lady,
we're gonna have to fight

990
00:55:09,255 --> 00:55:11,556
our way out of this one.

991
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,293
Three, two, one!

992
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,799
What is this place?

993
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:22,967
Suit lady, where am I?

994
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:25,136
<i>You're in the most
secure facility</i>

995
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:26,170
<i>on the eastern seaboard.</i>

996
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:28,606
<i>The damage control
deep storage vault.</i>

997
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:30,741
No. Seriously?

998
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:36,614
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

999
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:37,214
Morning?

1000
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:39,650
Hey, suit lady,
I kind of feel bad

1001
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,186
calling you "suit lady,"
you know?

1002
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:45,122
I think I should probably
give you a name...

1003
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:47,625
Like Liz. No, no, no.

1004
00:55:47,627 --> 00:55:50,061
God, that's-- that's weird.

1005
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:51,963
What about Karen?

1006
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:54,198
<i>You can call me Karen
if you would like.</i>

1007
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,369
Hey, Karen, what else
can this suit do?

1008
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,670
What?

1009
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:02,039
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

1010
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,874
<i>Ricochet web.</i> Ricochet web.

1011
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:07,979
Whoa! Cool. <i>Splitter web.</i>

1012
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,916
<i>Web grenade.</i> Web grenade!

1013
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:16,120
Should I tell Liz
that I'm spider-man?

1014
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,054
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

1015
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:20,057
Who's Liz? She's-- heh.

1016
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:21,759
She's the best. She's awesome.

1017
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:24,695
She's just a girl
who goes to my school.

1018
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:25,730
And, uh...

1019
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,865
Yeah, I just--
I really want to tell her,

1020
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:30,034
but it's kind of weird,
you know?

1021
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:33,070
"Hey, I'm-- I'm spider-man."

1022
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:34,205
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

1023
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,240
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

1024
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:39,276
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

1025
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:40,378
<i>Well, if I were her,</i>

1026
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,014
<i>I wouldn't be
disappointed at all.</i>

1027
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:44,015
Thanks, Karen.

1028
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:46,317
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

1029
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,020
Hey, how long
we been here anyways?

1030
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,988
<i>Thirty-seven minutes.</i> What?

1031
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,190
Thirty-seven minutes?
That's insane.

1032
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:54,358
I cannot take this anymore.

1033
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,194
I got to--
I gotta get out of here.

1034
00:56:57,196 --> 00:57:01,832
There's got to be something
in here I can use.

1035
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:04,435
Okay, let's see.

1036
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:06,971
Nope.

1037
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:08,272
That's awesome.

1038
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:10,307
Ah. Hey, it's like the glowy
thing.

1039
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:13,678
<i>That glowy thing is an
explosive chitauri energy core.</i>

1040
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,313
Whoa, whoa! You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

1041
00:57:16,315 --> 00:57:18,983
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it</i>

1042
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:20,851
<i>into an explosive state.</i>

1043
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:23,087
No, no, no, no, no.

1044
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:29,994
Hey! Please! Please, somebody,
let me out! Hey!

1045
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:32,863
Karen, you have to help me
override that time lock.

1046
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,700
Okay, Karen,
lower the voltage and run it.

1047
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,467
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

1048
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:40,805
Okay, we're just gonna
have to try every sequence.

1049
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:45,409
Ned, Peter, we're gonna
be late. Come on, let's go.

1050
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:49,146
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

1051
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,852
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

1052
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:58,456
It worked. It works!

1053
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:12,937
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

1054
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:13,738
Thank you.

1055
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,773
Karen, get me to the decathlon
as fast as possible.

1056
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:17,441
<i>Sure thing.
Just tell me where it is.</i>

1057
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,143
Across from
the Washington monument.

1058
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:20,745
<i>It's Ned. Leave a message.</i>

1059
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:24,215
Ned, call me back!
The glowy thing's a bomb!

1060
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,520
<i>There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.</i>

1061
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:32,289
We have now entered
sudden death.

1062
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:36,494
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

1063
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:41,966
Midtown tech?

1064
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:43,067
Zero.

1065
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:44,168
That is correct.

1066
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,772
<i>Midtown takes the championship!</i>

1067
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,074
Whoo-hoo!
- We won!

1068
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:51,509
You guys, I am so proud of you.

1069
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:53,144
Told you we didn't need Peter.

1070
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,279
Flash, you didn't
answer one question.

1071
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,981
Taking it all in?
Oh, yeah, I just--

1072
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:59,850
Um, I don't want
to celebrate something

1073
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:00,918
that was built by slaves.

1074
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,489
I'm sure the Washington monument
wasn't built by--

1075
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:07,525
Okay.

1076
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,261
Enjoy your book. Thanks.

1077
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,999
Oh, Ned, you're alive!
Peter, are you okay?

1078
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:16,500
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

1079
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:18,536
Don't worry, it's safe.
It's in my backpack.

1080
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:20,237
Ned, listen!
The glowy thing is dangerous!

1081
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:22,106
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

1082
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:24,542
Ned, listen to me!
We're at the Washington mon--

1083
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:26,010
Peter, is that you? Hey, Liz.

1084
00:59:26,012 --> 00:59:27,845
<i>Is that Liz?</i>
Put Ned on the phone.

1085
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,947
<i>Tell her how you feel.</i>
You flake!

1086
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:31,015
You are so lucky we won.

1087
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,917
I want to be mad,
but I'm more worried.

1088
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:34,351
Like, what is going on with you?

1089
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,120
I have to talk to Ned.
It's important!

1090
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:37,488
Miss, all items
on the belt, please.

1091
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,123
<i>There's something
in Ned's backpack!</i>

1092
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,893
<i>It's dangerous. Don't let it
go through an X-ray.</i>

1093
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:47,131
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

1094
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:52,970
Mr. Harrison, can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

1095
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:59,443
The Washington monument
is 555 feet,

1096
00:59:59,445 --> 01:00:02,947
five and one-eighth inches tall.

1097
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:05,583
Notice how the marble
and granite

1098
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:08,485
are cut around the stone.

1099
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,591
Did you hear that?

1100
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,960
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

1101
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:18,128
<i>The chitauri core has detonated</i>

1102
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,098
<i>and caused severe structural
damage to the elevator.</i>

1103
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,433
Oh, no. My friends are up there.

1104
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:25,102
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

1105
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:28,973
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my god, that's tall.

1106
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:35,012
Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.

1107
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:36,380
Just stay calm, everyone.

1108
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,516
Oh, we are all
going to die here.

1109
01:00:40,252 --> 01:00:44,088
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

1110
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,222
We're freakin' screwed.

1111
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,657
Okay, I know that was scary,

1112
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:48,259
but our safety systems
are working.

1113
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,595
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

1114
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:52,630
We're very safe in here.

1115
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:56,133
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

1116
01:00:56,135 --> 01:00:58,002
I'm going as fast as I can!

1117
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:08,479
Let's go. Give me your hand.

1118
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,149
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

1119
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:15,185
What? Why?
<i>Unexpected motion has caused</i>

1120
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:17,021
<i>the deterioration to escalate.</i>

1121
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:18,088
How do I get in there?

1122
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,325
<i>Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

1123
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:24,995
Whoa. Has that been there
this whole time? That's awesome.

1124
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:28,933
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

1125
01:01:29,134 --> 01:01:31,402
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

1126
01:01:31,404 --> 01:01:34,171
Karen, I'm on my way.

1127
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:39,643
There's a lot of glass here.
You got this.

1128
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,512
Keep coming, keep coming.

1129
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:51,388
Ah!

1130
01:01:54,427 --> 01:01:57,661
Okay. Oh, my god.

1131
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:58,729
Okay.

1132
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:02,499
<i>What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.</i>

1133
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,301
<i>Why are you hesitating?</i>
It's fine.

1134
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,970
I've just never been
this high before.

1135
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,072
<i>You have also not
reinstalled your parachute,</i>

1136
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:12,609
<i>so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

1137
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:14,411
Perfect.

1138
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:17,448
Oh, my god.

1139
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:19,116
Why is it not breaking?

1140
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:20,517
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.</i>

1141
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,754
<i>You'll have to create
more momentum.</i>

1142
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:43,474
<i>This is D.C. Metro police.</i>

1143
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:46,343
<i>Identify yourself.</i>
My friends are in there! Stop!

1144
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,078
Return to the ground
immediately.

1145
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,047
Okay, who's next?
Me, it's my turn!

1146
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:52,249
- Flash, seriously?
- What are you doing?

1147
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:55,085
Come on.
Don't worry about the trophy.

1148
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,724
Ahh!

1149
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,128
<i>Stand down!</i>

1150
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:08,165
<i>Return to the ground
immediately!</i>

1151
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:13,771
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

1152
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:15,672
Go up, go up.

1153
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:17,808
I got this.

1154
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:19,743
Take my trophy!

1155
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:23,514
This is your last chance!

1156
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:26,150
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1157
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:29,053
Look out!

1158
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:37,361
Ahh!

1159
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:52,209
I did it! Whoa!

1160
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:05,589
Ahem. Hey, how you doing?

1161
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,357
Don't worry about it. I got you.

1162
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,226
Yes! Yes! Hey, hey, hey.

1163
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:12,463
Big guy, quit moving around.
I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.

1164
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,601
Let's go, let's go!

1165
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,440
Okay, okay.

1166
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,375
Mr. Harrington, go.
Ned, come on.

1167
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:27,578
This is your stop. Come on, Liz.

1168
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,713
Go, go, go. Everybody out!

1169
01:04:29,715 --> 01:04:31,248
Move it, people.
Move it, move it!

1170
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,418
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz!

1171
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,824
You're okay. You're okay.

1172
01:04:44,262 --> 01:04:45,629
Okay.

1173
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,864
Oh, my god. Good, good.

1174
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:49,199
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1175
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:51,235
Come on in. You guys good?

1176
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:53,871
So is everyone okay?

1177
01:04:53,873 --> 01:04:56,807
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1178
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,343
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1179
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:02,146
Oh!

1180
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,780
Thank you.

1181
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:09,753
Are you really friends
with Peter Parker?

1182
01:05:15,894 --> 01:05:17,628
I can finish the next order,

1183
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:21,565
but without any new materials
from that truck...

1184
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,667
Yeah, damn it.

1185
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,703
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1186
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:29,840
Yeah, but then that's it.

1187
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:34,678
Oh, maybe it is time that
I built the high-altitude seal.

1188
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,714
Would you shut up about that?
It's only one job.

1189
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:39,650
No.

1190
01:05:39,652 --> 01:05:41,885
Eight years,
not a word from the feds,

1191
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,389
nothing from those
Halloween-costume-wearing bozos

1192
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:47,391
up there in Stark tower.

1193
01:05:47,393 --> 01:05:48,692
And then all of a sudden,

1194
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:51,628
this little bastard
in red tights shows up

1195
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:57,668
and he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1196
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:00,370
Really?

1197
01:06:00,372 --> 01:06:01,638
I'm gonna kill him.

1198
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,940
I'm gonna find him--
I found him.

1199
01:06:02,942 --> 01:06:05,943
<i>Spider-man swooped in,
heroically saving</i>

1200
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:08,345
<i>an academic decathlon team

1201
01:06:08,347 --> 01:06:13,650
<i>The identity of the masked hero

1202
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:16,620
Mom. Okay. All right.

1203
01:06:16,622 --> 01:06:20,557
Peter? Come here, come here.

1204
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:22,559
Oh, my god.

1205
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,896
<i>This past weekend, midtown's
academic decathlon team</i>

1206
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:26,997
<i>defeated the country's best</i>

1207
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:28,665
<i>to win the national
championship.</i>

1208
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,534
<i>Later that day,
they also defeated death.</i>

1209
01:06:30,536 --> 01:06:32,669
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. All scream.</i>

1210
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:34,605
<i>There were purple lasers
and smoke everywhere.</i>

1211
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:36,807
<i>It was tight,
like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

1212
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:38,542
<i>As you know,
we made it out alive,</i>

1213
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:40,244
<i>and that's the important thing.</i>

1214
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:44,715
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1215
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,283
<i>Not again.</i>

1216
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:48,952
<i>Thankfully, no one was
seriously injured,</i>

1217
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:50,020
<i>thanks to the spider-man.</i>

1218
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:51,922
<i>Thank you, spider-man.
Thank you, spider-man.</i>

1219
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,525
<i>Up next: The spider-man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1220
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:58,729
<i>How can you show
your spider spirit?</i>

1221
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:03,800
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1222
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:07,304
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1223
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:08,805
Crazy, dude. It's crazy.

1224
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,941
Should we tell everyone? No.

1225
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,042
Should I tell everyone?

1226
01:07:12,044 --> 01:07:13,644
No, dude.
That's not a good idea.

1227
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:15,412
Okay, come on,
we'll be late to class.

1228
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:17,614
I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble

1229
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,617
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1230
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,853
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from damage control.

1231
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:24,721
What he takes
from damage control,

1232
01:07:24,723 --> 01:07:26,056
that's how he builds
the weapons.

1233
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:27,557
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1234
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:28,859
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1235
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:31,295
Ned, I'm probably never
gonna come back here.

1236
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,530
Mr. Stark is moving
the avengers upstate

1237
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:36,733
so when I bring this guy in--
Dude.

1238
01:07:36,735 --> 01:07:38,802
You want to be
a high school dropout?

1239
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,306
I am so far beyond
high school right now.

1240
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,776
Parker, my office.

1241
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:49,012
<i>So...</i>

1242
01:07:49,014 --> 01:07:50,080
<i>You got detention.</i>

1243
01:07:50,082 --> 01:07:52,516
<i>You screwed up. You know
what you did was wrong.</i>

1244
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:55,485
<i>The question is, how are
you gonna make things right?</i>

1245
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:56,987
<i>Maybe you were
trying to be cool.</i>

1246
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,756
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years,</i>

1247
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:02,893
<i>the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.</i>

1248
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:06,496
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1249
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:09,066
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something</i>

1250
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:11,702
<i>you know is wrong...</i>
Where you going? Get back here.

1251
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:14,404
<i>Just think to yourself,
what would captain America do?</i>

1252
01:08:14,406 --> 01:08:16,740
Why are you here?
You don't even have detention.

1253
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:19,109
Oh, I know.
I just like coming here

1254
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:21,678
to sketch people in crisis.

1255
01:08:22,647 --> 01:08:25,816
Heh. It's you.

1256
01:08:25,818 --> 01:08:26,983
<i>So your body's changing.</i>

1257
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:30,687
<i>Believe me,
I know how that feels.</i>

1258
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:43,100
May?

1259
01:08:45,803 --> 01:08:46,870
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1260
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,373
<i>- Hey, Peter.
- How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1261
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,841
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1262
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:52,609
I'm trying to figure out
who the guys

1263
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:53,844
under the bridge
were that night,

1264
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:55,846
but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1265
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:57,414
<i>I can run facial recognition</i>

1266
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,116
<i>on the footage
of that encounter.</i>

1267
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:00,150
Footage? <i>Yes, Peter.</i>

1268
01:09:00,152 --> 01:09:02,052
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1269
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:04,121
Everything? Like, all the time?
<i>Everything.</i>

1270
01:09:04,123 --> 01:09:06,723
<i>It's called
the baby-monitor protocol.</i>

1271
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,525
Yeah, of course it is.

1272
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:12,829
Um, yeah, just roll it back
to last Friday.

1273
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,697
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1274
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:15,399
<i>Hey, everyone.
Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1275
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,701
<i>What's up, Liz? Peter's told me
a lot about you.</i>

1276
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:19,870
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1277
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:21,872
Go later in the day,
later in the day.

1278
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:24,441
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin!</i>

1279
01:09:24,443 --> 01:09:25,976
No, no, no. That's definitely--

1280
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:27,611
That's not
what we wanted to watch.

1281
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,579
<i>Your impressions are very funny.</i>

1282
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:31,915
Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1283
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:32,716
Okay.

1284
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:34,418
The two on the right,
who are they?

1285
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,952
<i>Searching law enforcement
databases.</i>

1286
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:39,456
<i>No records found
for two of the individuals.</i>

1287
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,958
Nothing?
<i>One individual identified.</i>

1288
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,026
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1289
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:47,097
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in queens.</i>

1290
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,432
Let's pay him a visit.

1291
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,833
<i>Would you like me to activate</i>

1292
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:52,469
<i>the enhanced
interrogation protocol?</i>

1293
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:53,503
Uh, yeah.

1294
01:10:07,952 --> 01:10:09,686
Remember me? Hey--

1295
01:10:09,688 --> 01:10:12,088
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1296
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,690
All right, chill. Come on!

1297
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:16,827
What happened to your voice?
What do you mean?

1298
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:19,696
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1299
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:21,097
I'm not a girl! I'm a boy.

1300
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:22,566
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.

1301
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:24,734
I don't care what you are,
a boy, a girl--

1302
01:10:24,736 --> 01:10:26,736
I'm not a girl! I'm a man.

1303
01:10:26,738 --> 01:10:27,671
Come on, man.

1304
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:29,005
Look, who is selling
these weapons?

1305
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:32,609
I need to know.
Give me names or else.

1306
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:36,680
You ain't ever
done this before, huh?

1307
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:40,484
Deactivate interrogation mode.

1308
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,018
Look, man,

1309
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,055
these guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1310
01:10:45,057 --> 01:10:46,656
They can't be out
on the streets.

1311
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:48,825
If one of them can cut
Delmar's bodega in half--

1312
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,761
You know Delmar's?
Yeah, best sandwich in queens.

1313
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:54,130
Sub haven's pretty good.
It's too much bread.

1314
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:57,701
I like bread.
Come on, man, please.

1315
01:10:58,135 --> 01:11:01,505
Stupid interrogation mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1316
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,073
The other night,
you told that dude,

1317
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:05,709
"if you shoot somebody,
shoot me."

1318
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:06,676
It's pretty ballsy.

1319
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:09,212
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1320
01:11:09,214 --> 01:11:11,882
I got a nephew who live here.

1321
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:12,916
Who are these guys?

1322
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:14,784
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1323
01:11:14,786 --> 01:11:17,687
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1324
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:20,824
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1325
01:11:21,692 --> 01:11:26,029
I do know where he's gonna be.
Really?

1326
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,598
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with,

1327
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,701
he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1328
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:33,136
Yes! Heh. Yes.

1329
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:34,271
Thank-- hey. Hey. Hey.

1330
01:11:34,273 --> 01:11:36,840
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1331
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:40,710
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--

1332
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:41,311
Yeah.

1333
01:11:41,313 --> 01:11:43,813
Where is it?
Can I give you some advice?

1334
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,015
Hm? You got to get better

1335
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:48,552
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.

1336
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,920
I'm intimidating.

1337
01:11:49,922 --> 01:11:52,822
Staten island ferry, 11.
Oh, that's soon.

1338
01:11:52,824 --> 01:11:55,025
Hey, that's gonna dissolve
in two hours.

1339
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,260
No, no, no, no. Come fix this.

1340
01:11:57,262 --> 01:11:59,563
Two hours. You deserve that.
I got ice cream in here.

1341
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,732
You deserve that. You're a
criminal. Bye, Mr. criminal.

1342
01:12:17,349 --> 01:12:19,215
Nice.

1343
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:23,987
Okay, Karen, activate
enhanced reconnaissance mode.

1344
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:25,188
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1345
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,058
<i>He's up front, main deck.</i>

1346
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,259
I hate this guy.

1347
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:30,860
It's the guy
from the bridge, right?

1348
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:32,329
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.

1349
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:35,365
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1350
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:37,033
<i>Incoming call from May Parker.</i>

1351
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:38,835
<i>Should I reroute
to your heads-up display?</i>

1352
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,304
I can't talk right now.
I'll call her back.

1353
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,007
Hey, Dronie,
keep an eye on that guy.

1354
01:12:44,009 --> 01:12:47,611
We can't let anybody
get away this time.

1355
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:56,319
- Who's the guy on the left?
<i>- Mac Gargan.</i>

1356
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:58,955
<i>Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.</i>

1357
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,957
<i>Would you like me
to activate instant kill?</i>

1358
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,327
No, Karen, stop it
with the instant kill already.

1359
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:09,633
White pickup truck.

1360
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:16,139
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1361
01:13:34,692 --> 01:13:36,760
Oh, this is too perfect.

1362
01:13:36,762 --> 01:13:39,329
They got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1363
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:42,766
<i>Incoming call from Tony Stark.</i>
No, no, no.

1364
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:44,401
Don't answer.
<i>Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

1365
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:47,837
- Uh, I'm actually at school.
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

1366
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,272
<i>Nice work in D.C.</i> okay.

1367
01:13:49,274 --> 01:13:52,275
<i>My dad never really gave me
a lot of support</i>

1368
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:54,244
<i>and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.</i>

1369
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:55,945
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

1370
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,214
<i>Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.</i>

1371
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:01,151
<i>Anyway, great things are
about to-- what is that?</i>

1372
01:14:01,153 --> 01:14:03,119
I'm at band practice.

1373
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:07,891
<i>That's odd. Happy told me
you quit band six weeks ago.</i>

1374
01:14:07,893 --> 01:14:09,826
<i>What's up?</i> I gotta go!

1375
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,461
End call. <i>Hey.</i>

1376
01:14:11,463 --> 01:14:13,763
I'll take those!

1377
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:15,098
Yoink!

1378
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,002
Hey, guys. The illegal
weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30.

1379
01:14:19,004 --> 01:14:20,970
You missed it!

1380
01:14:20,972 --> 01:14:23,173
Whoo!

1381
01:14:28,179 --> 01:14:31,047
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1382
01:14:32,349 --> 01:14:35,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.

1383
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,719
Ah!

1384
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,888
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1385
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:43,159
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

1386
01:14:43,161 --> 01:14:44,994
I'm honestly--

1387
01:14:44,996 --> 01:14:46,730
I'm-- I'm shocked.

1388
01:14:57,975 --> 01:15:01,077
Freeze! FBI! Don't move!

1389
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:02,278
Get on the ground! FBI!

1390
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,814
What do you mean, FBI?
<i>The federal bureau of invest--</i>

1391
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:08,118
I know what "FBI" means.
But what are they doing here?

1392
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:12,255
What the--?

1393
01:15:15,092 --> 01:15:18,061
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1394
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:19,028
Go, go, go, go!

1395
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,364
Get out of there! Whoa!

1396
01:15:21,432 --> 01:15:24,334
Look out! Look out!
Move! Move! Move!

1397
01:15:29,975 --> 01:15:31,541
- Move!
- Get to the top deck.

1398
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:34,344
We're getting out of here.

1399
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:54,230
Ah! Ah!

1400
01:16:11,382 --> 01:16:14,184
Activate taser web!

1401
01:16:24,428 --> 01:16:28,264
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1402
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:09,472
Oh, my god. What do I do?

1403
01:17:09,474 --> 01:17:11,140
Karen, give me
an X-ray of the boat

1404
01:17:11,142 --> 01:17:14,110
and target all
the strongest points.

1405
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,147
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1406
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:23,353
Splitter web, go.

1407
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:53,516
<i>- Great job, Peter.
- You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1408
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:56,986
Ninety-eight? Yeah, spider-man!

1409
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:01,991
No, no, no. No!

1410
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:07,030
No!

1411
01:18:12,703 --> 01:18:15,271
Oh, my god!

1412
01:18:19,077 --> 01:18:21,044
No! Ah!

1413
01:18:35,392 --> 01:18:37,393
What the hell?

1414
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:43,299
What the hell?

1415
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:46,135
<i>Hi, spider-man.</i>

1416
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:49,472
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1417
01:18:53,477 --> 01:18:56,045
Look! Look!

1418
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,295
Yeah, iron man!

1419
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:21,504
Uh, Mr. Stark.

1420
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,474
Hey, Mr. Stark,
could I do anything?

1421
01:19:24,476 --> 01:19:26,409
What do you want me to do? Whoa!

1422
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:30,546
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1423
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,497
- So that's it?
- You're just gonna run?

1424
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,534
Feds were waiting for us.

1425
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:55,204
Now we're on iron man's radar?

1426
01:19:55,206 --> 01:19:58,207
Yeah, I'm running.

1427
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,142
You should too.

1428
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:01,811
You know I can't do that.

1429
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:02,645
So now what?

1430
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:05,581
Mason, can you get
that high-altitude

1431
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,418
seal thing up
and running in time?

1432
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,619
Seriously?

1433
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:13,423
Yes. You will not regret this.

1434
01:20:15,793 --> 01:20:17,593
You in?

1435
01:20:27,472 --> 01:20:30,106
<i>Previously on</i>
Peter screws the pooch,

1436
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:31,607
<i>I tell you
to stay away from this.</i>

1437
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:34,510
<i>Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit</i>

1438
01:20:34,512 --> 01:20:36,612
<i>so you could sneak around
behind my back</i>

1439
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:40,416
<i>doing the one thing
I told you not to do.</i>

1440
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,584
Is everyone okay?

1441
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:45,588
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1442
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,157
No thanks to me?

1443
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:50,326
Those weapons were out there

1444
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:52,195
and I tried
to tell you about it,

1445
01:20:52,197 --> 01:20:53,196
but you didn't listen.

1446
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:54,564
None of this would've happened

1447
01:20:54,566 --> 01:20:55,798
if you had just listened to me.

1448
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,136
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

1449
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:04,640
I did listen, kid.

1450
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:06,275
Who do you think
called the FBI, huh?

1451
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:09,545
Do you know I was the only
one who believed in you?

1452
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:11,447
Everyone else said I was crazy

1453
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,850
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
I'm 15.

1454
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:16,219
No. This is where
you zip it, all right?

1455
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:17,220
The adult is talking.

1456
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:18,621
What if somebody
had died tonight?

1457
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:22,325
Different story, right?
'Cause that's on you.

1458
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:23,459
And if you died,

1459
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,394
I feel like that's on me.

1460
01:21:25,396 --> 01:21:27,830
I don't need that
on my conscience.

1461
01:21:27,832 --> 01:21:29,198
Yes, sir, I'm sorry. Yes.

1462
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,434
I understand.
Sorry doesn't cut it.

1463
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:33,302
I just wanted to be like you.

1464
01:21:33,304 --> 01:21:35,905
And I wanted you to be better.

1465
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,874
Okay, it's not working out.

1466
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,308
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1467
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,144
For how long? Forever.

1468
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,546
Yeah, that's how it works.
No, no. Please. Please.

1469
01:21:43,548 --> 01:21:44,914
Let's have it.
You don't understand.

1470
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:47,283
This is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.

1471
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:49,285
If you're nothing
without this suit,

1472
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:51,888
then you shouldn't
have it, okay?

1473
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:54,790
God, I sound like my dad.

1474
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:58,227
I don't have any other clothes.

1475
01:21:58,229 --> 01:22:00,763
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1476
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:13,509
Hey.

1477
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:18,648
I've been calling you all day.

1478
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,683
You didn't answer your phone.

1479
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:21,884
You can't do that.

1480
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,754
Then this ferry thing happens.

1481
01:22:24,756 --> 01:22:27,557
I've called five police
stations.

1482
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:29,926
Five. I called five
of your friends.

1483
01:22:29,928 --> 01:22:32,395
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.

1484
01:22:32,397 --> 01:22:35,464
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1485
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:38,367
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.

1486
01:22:38,369 --> 01:22:40,670
I know you left the hotel
room in Washington.

1487
01:22:40,672 --> 01:22:43,706
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1488
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:44,674
That's not fine.

1489
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:46,909
Peter, you have to tell
me what's going on.

1490
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:50,846
Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.

1491
01:22:51,548 --> 01:22:53,683
I lost the Stark internship.

1492
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:55,918
What? Yeah.

1493
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,852
What happened?

1494
01:22:56,854 --> 01:22:59,555
I just thought that
I could work really hard

1495
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,958
and he could--
He would-- you know.

1496
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,294
But... I screwed it up.

1497
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:07,964
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1498
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:10,900
It's okay.

1499
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:13,436
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1500
01:23:13,438 --> 01:23:16,239
You know I'm not trying
to ruin your life.

1501
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,673
Yeah, I know.

1502
01:23:17,675 --> 01:23:18,708
Just--

1503
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:22,245
I used to sneak out too. Yeah.

1504
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,015
And take a shower. You smell.

1505
01:23:26,017 --> 01:23:29,619
You smell like--
You smell like garbage.

1506
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:31,721
I know.

1507
01:23:33,624 --> 01:23:36,292
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid,

1508
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:39,996
so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1509
01:23:39,998 --> 01:23:40,997
Okay.

1510
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:44,267
All right, get out of here.

1511
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,041
Are you expelled?

1512
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:53,743
Do you have to go to
that school on 46th

1513
01:23:53,745 --> 01:23:55,511
where their principal
has a crossbow?

1514
01:23:55,513 --> 01:23:56,979
Pretty sure that's
an urban myth,

1515
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:59,882
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1516
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:01,817
You're so lucky.

1517
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:26,809
<i>Muy bueno, señor Parker.</i>

1518
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,667
Hey.

1519
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:52,435
Hey.

1520
01:24:52,437 --> 01:24:54,036
I thought you had
calculus fifth period.

1521
01:24:54,038 --> 01:24:57,573
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1522
01:24:57,575 --> 01:24:59,075
Hey, look, i--

1523
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:00,976
I just wanted to apologize

1524
01:25:00,978 --> 01:25:03,346
about the whole decathlon thing.

1525
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:03,946
It's fine.

1526
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:06,549
Last week, decathlon was
the most important thing,

1527
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:08,417
but then I almost died.

1528
01:25:08,419 --> 01:25:10,553
No, I just-- I'm--

1529
01:25:10,555 --> 01:25:12,121
I just mean that

1530
01:25:12,123 --> 01:25:16,058
it was not cool, especially...

1531
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:19,962
Because...

1532
01:25:20,597 --> 01:25:23,532
I like you.

1533
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,601
I know.

1534
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:28,504
You do?

1535
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:31,507
You're terrible
at keeping secrets.

1536
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:34,076
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1537
01:25:36,413 --> 01:25:38,914
I got to get to class, but--

1538
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:40,383
I'd say we should hang out,

1539
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,685
but I'm gonna be in
detention for...

1540
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:45,821
Uh-huh. Ever, but--

1541
01:25:45,823 --> 01:25:48,891
I guess you already have
a date to homecoming.

1542
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,626
Actually, I was so busy
planning it,

1543
01:25:50,628 --> 01:25:55,498
I never really got around
to that part, so...

1544
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,066
Uh, you want to

1545
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:59,468
go with me?

1546
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:00,936
Yeah. Sure.

1547
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:04,173
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1548
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,508
Cool.

1549
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,645
I'm actually going that way.

1550
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:22,625
May, I need your help.

1551
01:26:44,182 --> 01:26:45,481
Right?

1552
01:26:55,593 --> 01:26:58,694
- It's game day.
- So what's the plan?

1553
01:26:58,696 --> 01:27:00,029
Open the door for her. Mm-hm.

1554
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:01,897
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much

1555
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:04,033
because that's creepy.
Don't be creepy.

1556
01:27:04,035 --> 01:27:05,568
No. And when I dance with her,

1557
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:09,004
I'm putting my hands
on her hips. I got this.

1558
01:27:11,542 --> 01:27:12,641
- Love you.
- Bye.

1559
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:29,658
You must be Peter.

1560
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,260
Yeah.

1561
01:27:31,262 --> 01:27:33,028
I'm Liz's dad.

1562
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:35,064
Put 'er there.

1563
01:27:35,066 --> 01:27:36,699
Hell of a grip.

1564
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:39,768
Come on in here. Come on.

1565
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:03,993
Hi, Peter.

1566
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:06,161
You look very handsome.

1567
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:07,162
Thank you.

1568
01:28:07,164 --> 01:28:10,132
You got his name right?

1569
01:28:10,134 --> 01:28:11,734
Freddie? Peter.

1570
01:28:11,736 --> 01:28:13,802
Peter. Peter.

1571
01:28:13,804 --> 01:28:15,638
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1572
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,740
Okay.

1573
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:24,780
You all right, Pete?

1574
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:25,714
Yeah.

1575
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:29,118
Because you look pale.

1576
01:28:29,786 --> 01:28:31,554
You want something to drink?

1577
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:32,288
Like a bourbon

1578
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:33,923
or a scotch,
or something like that?

1579
01:28:33,925 --> 01:28:35,691
I'm not old enough to drink.

1580
01:28:35,693 --> 01:28:37,660
That's the right answer.

1581
01:28:39,297 --> 01:28:41,897
Wow! Wow, wow, wow,

1582
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:42,965
do you look beautiful.

1583
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:44,900
Please don't embarrass me, dad.

1584
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:46,101
Doesn't she, Pete?

1585
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:48,070
Yeah, you look really good.

1586
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:51,307
Once again,
that's the right answer.

1587
01:28:51,309 --> 01:28:53,909
Is that a corsage?

1588
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,278
Thanks.

1589
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,947
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,

1590
01:28:57,949 --> 01:28:59,882
so let's get this
show on the road.

1591
01:28:59,884 --> 01:29:01,183
No, no, no, we have to take

1592
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:03,152
some pictures, babe. All right.

1593
01:29:03,154 --> 01:29:05,754
Oh, right here. Perfect. Mom.

1594
01:29:05,756 --> 01:29:07,723
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1595
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:10,793
Peter, closer.

1596
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,228
Smile.

1597
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,165
There you go.

1598
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:17,633
Oh.

1599
01:29:20,837 --> 01:29:22,371
Sir, you don't have to drive us.

1600
01:29:22,373 --> 01:29:23,973
Nah, nah, it's not a big deal.

1601
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:26,775
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1602
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:28,143
He's always coming and going.

1603
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:29,645
Last time. Have fun.

1604
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:30,713
Thank you. Promise.

1605
01:29:30,715 --> 01:29:33,015
He's cute. Shh.

1606
01:29:34,017 --> 01:29:35,284
See you in a couple of days.

1607
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:36,952
Bye, baby. All right.

1608
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:38,153
Come on, Pedro.

1609
01:29:38,155 --> 01:29:40,289
Bye, Peter. Have fun.
Yeah, I will.

1610
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,635
What are you gonna do, Pete?

1611
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:53,235
What?

1612
01:29:53,237 --> 01:29:55,371
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1613
01:29:55,373 --> 01:29:58,774
Oh, I don't know.
Don't grill him, dad.

1614
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:01,010
Just saying, you know.

1615
01:30:01,012 --> 01:30:02,778
All you guys
who go to that school

1616
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,748
you pretty much have your
life planned out, right?

1617
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,983
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1618
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:10,386
Peter has an internship
with Tony Stark.

1619
01:30:10,388 --> 01:30:12,421
So I think he doesn't
have to worry.

1620
01:30:12,423 --> 01:30:13,989
Really? Mm-hm.

1621
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:16,125
- Stark?
- So cool.

1622
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:18,327
Oh. What do you do?

1623
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:22,031
Actually, I don't
intern for him anymore.

1624
01:30:22,033 --> 01:30:25,000
Seriously? Yeah, it got...

1625
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,769
Boring.

1626
01:30:26,771 --> 01:30:27,703
It was boring?

1627
01:30:27,705 --> 01:30:29,838
You got to hang out
with spider-man.

1628
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,740
Really? Spider-man?

1629
01:30:31,742 --> 01:30:34,977
Wow. What's he like?

1630
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:37,279
Yeah, he's nice.

1631
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:40,783
Nice man. Solid dude.

1632
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,253
Hm.

1633
01:30:44,255 --> 01:30:46,388
Look. So cute.

1634
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:49,224
Oh.

1635
01:30:51,127 --> 01:30:53,295
I've seen you around, right?

1636
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:54,863
I mean, somewhere.

1637
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:57,700
We've-- have we ever--?
Because even the voice--

1638
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,135
He does academic
decathlon with me.

1639
01:31:00,137 --> 01:31:01,970
Oh. And he was at my party.

1640
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:04,206
- Ah.
- It was a great party.

1641
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,374
Really great, yeah.

1642
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:07,276
Beautiful house,
a lot of windows.

1643
01:31:07,278 --> 01:31:10,012
You were there for,
like, two seconds.

1644
01:31:10,014 --> 01:31:11,046
That was--

1645
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:13,215
I was there longer
than two seconds.

1646
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,317
You disappeared. No.

1647
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:17,920
No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did.

1648
01:31:17,922 --> 01:31:19,488
You disappeared
like you always do.

1649
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,323
Like you did in D.C. too.

1650
01:31:28,064 --> 01:31:29,732
That's terrible

1651
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,935
what happened down
there in D.C. though.

1652
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:34,470
Were you scared?

1653
01:31:34,472 --> 01:31:37,372
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal spider-man

1654
01:31:37,374 --> 01:31:40,976
showed up in the elevator
though, huh?

1655
01:31:42,178 --> 01:31:44,446
Yeah, well, I actually
didn't go up.

1656
01:31:44,448 --> 01:31:46,782
I saw it all from the ground.

1657
01:31:46,784 --> 01:31:48,751
Yeah.

1658
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:52,187
Very lucky that
he was there that day.

1659
01:31:54,157 --> 01:31:57,326
Good old spider-man.

1660
01:32:00,397 --> 01:32:03,499
Dad, the light.

1661
01:32:17,982 --> 01:32:20,382
Here we are. End of the line.

1662
01:32:20,384 --> 01:32:21,850
Thanks, dad.

1663
01:32:21,852 --> 01:32:23,452
You head in there, gumdrop.

1664
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:27,790
I'm gonna give Peter
the "dad" talk.

1665
01:32:28,324 --> 01:32:30,492
Don't let him intimidate you.

1666
01:32:30,494 --> 01:32:31,794
Love you.

1667
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,496
Love you, gumdrop.
Have a safe flight.

1668
01:32:34,498 --> 01:32:36,865
Hi.

1669
01:32:36,867 --> 01:32:40,235
You guys look so pretty.

1670
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,541
Does she know?

1671
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:47,576
Know what?

1672
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:49,344
So she doesn't. Good.

1673
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:52,414
Close to the vest.
I admire that.

1674
01:32:52,416 --> 01:32:55,184
I've got a few secrets
of my own.

1675
01:32:55,186 --> 01:32:56,285
Of all the reasons

1676
01:32:56,287 --> 01:33:00,088
I didn't want
my daughter to date...

1677
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:02,825
Peter,

1678
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,260
nothing is more important
than family.

1679
01:33:05,262 --> 01:33:06,995
You saved my daughter's life.

1680
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:09,164
I could never forget
something like that.

1681
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,533
So I'm gonna give you
one chance.

1682
01:33:11,535 --> 01:33:12,434
Are you ready?

1683
01:33:12,436 --> 01:33:14,203
You walk through those doors,

1684
01:33:14,205 --> 01:33:16,405
you forget any of this happened

1685
01:33:16,407 --> 01:33:18,440
and don't you ever,

1686
01:33:18,442 --> 01:33:19,541
ever

1687
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:23,111
interfere with
my business again.

1688
01:33:23,113 --> 01:33:25,180
'Cause if you do,

1689
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:27,115
I'll kill you

1690
01:33:27,117 --> 01:33:30,285
and everybody you love.

1691
01:33:30,287 --> 01:33:31,620
I'll kill you dead.

1692
01:33:31,622 --> 01:33:34,389
That's what I'll do
to protect my family, Pete.

1693
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:37,392
Do you understand?

1694
01:33:37,394 --> 01:33:39,194
Hey.

1695
01:33:39,196 --> 01:33:44,132
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1696
01:33:45,168 --> 01:33:46,268
Thank you.

1697
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:48,570
You're welcome.

1698
01:33:48,572 --> 01:33:50,472
Now, you go on in there,

1699
01:33:50,474 --> 01:33:54,543
you show my daughter
a good time, okay?

1700
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:57,512
Just not too good.

1701
01:34:51,034 --> 01:34:52,034
Hey.

1702
01:34:53,971 --> 01:34:56,471
What did he say to you?

1703
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:02,210
I've got to go.

1704
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:05,080
I'm-- I'm sorry.

1705
01:35:05,082 --> 01:35:08,083
You don't deserve this.

1706
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:28,470
Ah!

1707
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:29,671
He gave you a choice.

1708
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:32,107
You chose wrong. What the hell?

1709
01:35:32,109 --> 01:35:34,343
What's with the crappy costume?

1710
01:35:36,447 --> 01:35:38,480
My web-shooters.

1711
01:35:43,286 --> 01:35:45,320
Whoa!

1712
01:35:46,022 --> 01:35:48,690
I wasn't sure about
this thing at first,

1713
01:35:48,692 --> 01:35:51,493
but... Damn.

1714
01:35:55,466 --> 01:35:58,567
Oh, gross.

1715
01:36:08,711 --> 01:36:13,081
Why did he send you here?
Guess you'll never know.

1716
01:36:15,718 --> 01:36:19,354
Huh? Nice shot!

1717
01:36:22,492 --> 01:36:24,493
Yes!

1718
01:36:24,495 --> 01:36:26,495
Ned, the guy with
the wings is Liz's dad.

1719
01:36:26,497 --> 01:36:28,296
What?
I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1720
01:36:28,298 --> 01:36:31,433
Call Happy Hogan. He's
Mr. Stark's head of security.

1721
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:33,068
Get a computer and
track my phone for me.

1722
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:35,704
Are you gonna be okay?
Hurry, we gotta catch him

1723
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:38,106
before he leaves town.

1724
01:36:38,108 --> 01:36:39,207
I'm sorry about dinner,

1725
01:36:39,209 --> 01:36:41,777
but I know when
branzino's fresh,

1726
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:43,745
and that was not fresh, okay?

1727
01:36:43,747 --> 01:36:44,579
So-- ah!

1728
01:36:44,581 --> 01:36:47,115
Flash, I need
your car and your phone.

1729
01:36:47,117 --> 01:36:50,419
Sir, technically, this is my
dad's car, sir, so I can't--

1730
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,823
Ah!

1731
01:36:58,127 --> 01:37:00,762
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey,
can you hear me?

1732
01:37:00,764 --> 01:37:01,663
Go for Ned.

1733
01:37:01,665 --> 01:37:04,266
Ned, I need you
to track my phone for me.

1734
01:37:04,268 --> 01:37:07,569
Yeah, but where is it?

1735
01:37:09,138 --> 01:37:10,772
Genius move.
Okay, he just passed

1736
01:37:10,774 --> 01:37:12,307
the Gamestop on Jackson Avenue.

1737
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:14,476
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing?

1738
01:37:14,478 --> 01:37:16,812
I'm in Flash's car.
I'll pull the specs.

1739
01:37:16,814 --> 01:37:18,313
Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1740
01:37:18,315 --> 01:37:20,482
You stole Flash's car? Awesome.

1741
01:37:20,484 --> 01:37:22,117
Yeah, it's awesome! It's awe--

1742
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:23,351
Oh! Get out of the way!

1743
01:37:23,353 --> 01:37:24,719
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

1744
01:37:24,721 --> 01:37:27,089
Peter, are you okay?
<i>I've never driven before.</i>

1745
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,623
Only with May in parking lots.

1746
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:31,293
This is a huge step up. Whoa!

1747
01:37:31,295 --> 01:37:33,862
<i>Hey, have you gotten
through to Happy yet?</i>

1748
01:37:33,864 --> 01:37:35,363
Uh, yeah. I'm working on it.

1749
01:37:35,365 --> 01:37:38,533
I just gotta backdoor
the phone system.

1750
01:37:40,837 --> 01:37:43,638
Guy in the chair.

1751
01:37:47,477 --> 01:37:48,877
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1752
01:37:48,879 --> 01:37:50,879
<i>Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>

1753
01:37:50,881 --> 01:37:52,481
Mr. Happy, it's Ned. <i>Who?</i>

1754
01:37:52,483 --> 01:37:53,849
I'm an associate
of Peter Parker.

1755
01:37:53,851 --> 01:37:55,550
Got something important
to tell you--

1756
01:37:55,552 --> 01:37:58,320
<i>- You gotta be shitting me.</i>
- Damn.

1757
01:37:58,322 --> 01:38:01,456
Hey, Ned, how we coming
with those headlights?

1758
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,257
Uh...

1759
01:38:02,259 --> 01:38:04,793
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel,

1760
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:06,495
<i>- turn clockwise.</i>
- Left, okay.

1761
01:38:06,497 --> 01:38:08,463
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1762
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:12,234
Um... He stopped in an old
industrial park in Brooklyn.

1763
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:13,502
What? That makes no sense!

1764
01:38:13,504 --> 01:38:15,170
I thought he said he was
going out of town!

1765
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:16,872
<i>Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.</i>

1766
01:38:16,874 --> 01:38:18,540
Don't think he likes you,
by the way.

1767
01:38:18,542 --> 01:38:20,208
Sounded like he was
catching a flight.

1768
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:22,277
<i>Something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

1769
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:24,346
<i>What?</i>
He was surrounded by boxes.

1770
01:38:24,348 --> 01:38:25,547
Boxes? It's moving day.

1771
01:38:25,549 --> 01:38:27,816
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1772
01:38:27,818 --> 01:38:31,286
I gotta stop him!

1773
01:38:32,355 --> 01:38:34,422
All right, wheels up
in eight minutes.

1774
01:38:34,424 --> 01:38:37,359
We just got to load Tony's
old Hulkbuster armor,

1775
01:38:37,361 --> 01:38:40,762
prototype for Cap's new
shield, and the Meging--

1776
01:38:40,764 --> 01:38:45,300
The Meg-- the--
Thor's magic belt.

1777
01:38:45,368 --> 01:38:47,302
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close.

1778
01:38:47,304 --> 01:38:48,737
<i>It's on your right.</i> What?

1779
01:38:48,739 --> 01:38:50,739
<i>Turn right! Turn right!</i>

1780
01:38:59,248 --> 01:39:01,616
Peter, are you okay? Yeah.

1781
01:39:01,618 --> 01:39:04,553
Just keep trying
to get through to Happy.

1782
01:39:04,555 --> 01:39:07,422
It's been an honor, spider-man.

1783
01:39:07,424 --> 01:39:10,625
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1784
01:39:10,627 --> 01:39:12,661
Uh...

1785
01:39:13,529 --> 01:39:16,498
I'm looking

1786
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,568
at porn.

1787
01:39:56,939 --> 01:39:58,340
Hey!

1788
01:39:59,643 --> 01:40:01,276
Surprised?

1789
01:40:01,278 --> 01:40:02,677
Oh, hey, Pete.

1790
01:40:02,679 --> 01:40:04,879
I didn't hear you come in.

1791
01:40:04,881 --> 01:40:06,781
It's over. I've got you.

1792
01:40:06,783 --> 01:40:09,284
You know,
I gotta tell you, Pete,

1793
01:40:09,286 --> 01:40:13,755
I really, really admire
your grit.

1794
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:16,558
I see why Liz likes you.

1795
01:40:17,026 --> 01:40:19,728
I do. When you first
came to the house,

1796
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,997
I wasn't sure.
I thought, "really?"

1797
01:40:21,999 --> 01:40:22,931
But I get it now.

1798
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:24,866
How could you do this to her?

1799
01:40:24,868 --> 01:40:28,003
To her? I'm not doing
anything to her, Pete.

1800
01:40:28,005 --> 01:40:30,705
I'm doing this for her.

1801
01:40:30,707 --> 01:40:33,041
Huh, yeah.

1802
01:40:35,912 --> 01:40:38,346
Peter,

1803
01:40:38,348 --> 01:40:39,281
you're young.

1804
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,850
You don't understand
how the world works.

1805
01:40:41,852 --> 01:40:42,851
Yeah, but I understand

1806
01:40:42,853 --> 01:40:44,552
that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1807
01:40:44,554 --> 01:40:47,522
How do you think your buddy
Stark paid for that tower?

1808
01:40:47,524 --> 01:40:48,757
Or any of his little toys?

1809
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:50,525
Those people, Pete,
those people up there,

1810
01:40:50,527 --> 01:40:53,595
the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1811
01:40:53,597 --> 01:40:56,798
Guys like us, like you and me,

1812
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,633
they don't care about us.

1813
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:01,436
We build their roads
and we fight all their wars

1814
01:41:01,438 --> 01:41:04,039
and everything, but they
don't care about us.

1815
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,573
We have to pick up after 'em.

1816
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:08,910
We have to eat
their table scraps.

1817
01:41:09,912 --> 01:41:11,413
That's how it is.

1818
01:41:11,415 --> 01:41:14,082
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Peter.

1819
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:16,051
Why are you telling me this?

1820
01:41:16,053 --> 01:41:19,087
Because I want you
to understand.

1821
01:41:19,089 --> 01:41:20,021
And...

1822
01:41:20,023 --> 01:41:24,526
I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1823
01:41:36,605 --> 01:41:39,107
I'm sorry, Peter.

1824
01:41:40,576 --> 01:41:41,776
What are you talking about?

1825
01:41:41,778 --> 01:41:45,046
That thing hasn't even
touched me yet.

1826
01:41:45,048 --> 01:41:47,048
True. Then again,

1827
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:50,118
wasn't really trying to.

1828
01:41:53,723 --> 01:41:56,091
<i>Chief, they're
powering up engines.</i>

1829
01:41:56,093 --> 01:42:00,095
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1830
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:48,410
Oh, god.

1831
01:42:51,448 --> 01:42:53,181
Okay, ready?

1832
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:04,659
Hello!

1833
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:07,829
Hello!

1834
01:43:07,831 --> 01:43:09,464
Please. Hey.

1835
01:43:09,466 --> 01:43:12,434
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1836
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,002
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1837
01:43:14,004 --> 01:43:17,172
I'm stuck. I can't move.
I can't--

1838
01:43:32,955 --> 01:43:35,557
<i>If you're nothing
without this suit,</i>

1839
01:43:35,559 --> 01:43:38,760
<i>then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1840
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:45,733
Come on, Peter.

1841
01:43:45,735 --> 01:43:47,502
Come on, spider-man.

1842
01:43:47,504 --> 01:43:49,571
Come on, spider-man.

1843
01:43:49,573 --> 01:43:52,474
Come on, spider-man.

1844
01:43:53,742 --> 01:43:55,977
Come on, spider-man!

1845
01:44:45,995 --> 01:44:49,197
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1846
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,566
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1847
01:45:05,581 --> 01:45:09,050
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1848
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:20,695
<i>Got a visual on the plane,</i>

1849
01:45:20,697 --> 01:45:22,263
<i>but I'm feeling
a little resistance.</i>

1850
01:45:22,265 --> 01:45:25,767
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1851
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,305
Ah!

1852
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:34,075
Whoa!

1853
01:45:36,979 --> 01:45:39,847
<i>Look out for
the cloaking cameras.</i>

1854
01:45:39,849 --> 01:45:42,283
<i>Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1855
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,894
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1856
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,863
Deploy high-altitude
vacuum seal.

1857
01:45:55,865 --> 01:45:59,033
<i>This better work, Mason.</i>

1858
01:46:02,171 --> 01:46:04,739
<i>Trust me, boss,
even one of those boxes</i>

1859
01:46:04,741 --> 01:46:07,809
<i>and we are set for life. Yeah.</i>

1860
01:46:16,919 --> 01:46:18,152
Hey! Ah! Whew.

1861
01:46:18,154 --> 01:46:21,189
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit</i>

1862
01:46:21,191 --> 01:46:24,158
<i>and override their security.</i>

1863
01:46:34,203 --> 01:46:36,738
<i>Cloning transponder signal.</i>

1864
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,406
Launching decoy drone.

1865
01:46:38,408 --> 01:46:41,676
Whoa.

1866
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:45,647
<i>Entering new coordinates.</i>

1867
01:46:49,852 --> 01:46:51,686
Good, so it's on its way?

1868
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:55,890
Yes, sir, right on course.
Okay, thank you.

1869
01:46:55,892 --> 01:46:57,825
All right.

1870
01:47:09,672 --> 01:47:12,106
Hot dog.

1871
01:48:00,289 --> 01:48:02,190
Just a typical homecoming

1872
01:48:02,192 --> 01:48:05,159
on the outside of
an invisible jet-- ah!

1873
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:07,762
Fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1874
01:48:07,764 --> 01:48:11,499
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1875
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,974
Oh, god!

1876
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:27,882
Whew. I can't believe
that worked.

1877
01:49:04,086 --> 01:49:06,788
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1878
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:10,057
<i>I'm not going home empty-handed.</i>

1879
01:49:18,333 --> 01:49:21,035
Oh, my god.

1880
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:36,450
<i>- Get out of there.
- What are you doing?</i>

1881
01:49:36,452 --> 01:49:39,387
Please turn! Please turn!

1882
01:51:12,948 --> 01:51:15,383
<i>Hey, Pedro.</i>

1883
01:52:01,997 --> 01:52:03,731
<i>Bingo.</i>

1884
01:52:18,747 --> 01:52:20,214
Your wingsuit.

1885
01:52:20,216 --> 01:52:24,118
Your wingsuit's gonna explode!

1886
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:32,093
Time to go home, Pete.

1887
01:52:32,095 --> 01:52:34,495
I'm trying to save you!

1888
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:46,240
No!

1889
01:52:49,077 --> 01:52:51,212
No.

1890
01:52:51,214 --> 01:52:53,280
No!

1891
01:53:02,791 --> 01:53:05,459
Ah! Ah!

1892
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:33,881
It looked so insane.
That whole--

1893
01:54:33,883 --> 01:54:35,516
Like, it was just crazy.

1894
01:54:35,518 --> 01:54:37,785
He was just, like...

1895
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:39,653
And you were like, "ah!"

1896
01:54:39,655 --> 01:54:42,289
And then I just hit him
with the "fffew."

1897
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:44,425
It was so-- oh, my god.

1898
01:54:44,427 --> 01:54:46,727
You saved me.

1899
01:54:46,729 --> 01:54:49,363
It was awesome.

1900
01:54:54,503 --> 01:54:57,204
Hey, Liz.

1901
01:54:57,206 --> 01:54:59,306
I'm gonna miss you.

1902
01:54:59,308 --> 01:55:01,509
Bye.

1903
01:55:01,511 --> 01:55:03,644
Liz.

1904
01:55:08,817 --> 01:55:11,218
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1905
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:12,453
You say that a lot.

1906
01:55:12,455 --> 01:55:15,222
What are you sorry
for this time?

1907
01:55:16,258 --> 01:55:18,392
The dance?

1908
01:55:18,394 --> 01:55:21,262
That was a pretty crappy
thing to do.

1909
01:55:21,264 --> 01:55:23,430
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad--

1910
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:25,432
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

1911
01:55:25,434 --> 01:55:27,501
If there's anything
I can do to help...

1912
01:55:27,503 --> 01:55:30,337
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1913
01:55:30,339 --> 01:55:34,308
Mom says it's nice there,
so that's cool.

1914
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:37,511
Anyways, dad doesn't
want us here

1915
01:55:37,513 --> 01:55:40,281
during the trial, so...

1916
01:55:40,815 --> 01:55:43,684
Liz, i-- i--

1917
01:55:43,686 --> 01:55:45,286
Bye, Peter.

1918
01:55:45,288 --> 01:55:47,488
Whatever's going on with you,

1919
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:50,424
I hope you figure it out.

1920
01:56:01,603 --> 01:56:06,373
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1921
01:56:06,375 --> 01:56:07,308
Yeah!

1922
01:56:07,310 --> 01:56:09,743
I'm gonna have to put this
back in the trophy case soon,

1923
01:56:09,745 --> 01:56:12,880
but just for motivation
right now at this practice.

1924
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:14,415
I'm a little ahead of the game,

1925
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:16,650
but we will need a new
team captain next year.

1926
01:56:16,652 --> 01:56:20,955
So I am appointing Michelle.

1927
01:56:20,957 --> 01:56:23,390
Yeah!

1928
01:56:24,726 --> 01:56:25,759
Uh, thank you.

1929
01:56:25,761 --> 01:56:26,994
My-- my friends call me MJ.

1930
01:56:26,996 --> 01:56:30,464
I thought you didn't
have any friends.

1931
01:56:30,466 --> 01:56:32,866
I didn't.

1932
01:56:36,471 --> 01:56:39,873
I gotta go.
Hey, where you going?

1933
01:56:40,909 --> 01:56:44,745
What are you hiding, Peter?

1934
01:56:45,647 --> 01:56:47,448
I'm just kidding.
I don't care. Bye.

1935
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:49,850
All right, so we should
run some drills.

1936
01:56:49,852 --> 01:56:52,486
Yeah.

1937
01:56:57,993 --> 01:57:02,596
Hey, Happy. What--
What are you doing here?

1938
01:57:02,598 --> 01:57:05,499
I really owe you one.

1939
01:57:06,001 --> 01:57:08,636
I don't know what I would
do without this job.

1940
01:57:08,638 --> 01:57:10,804
I mean, before I met Tony--

1941
01:57:40,569 --> 01:57:42,403
So how long you been here?

1942
01:57:42,405 --> 01:57:44,972
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1943
01:57:44,974 --> 01:57:46,774
Is he here too?

1944
01:57:46,776 --> 01:57:48,709
In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1945
01:57:48,711 --> 01:57:51,345
Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?

1946
01:57:51,347 --> 01:57:53,614
Yeah, let's go.

1947
01:57:53,848 --> 01:57:55,015
Take a look.

1948
01:57:55,017 --> 01:57:57,751
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1949
01:57:57,753 --> 01:58:01,555
They just finished
remodeling the whole thing.

1950
01:58:26,548 --> 01:58:30,884
You don't see that every day.
Oh, there they are.

1951
01:58:30,886 --> 01:58:33,520
How was the ride up? Good.

1952
01:58:33,522 --> 01:58:36,590
Give me a minute with the kid.

1953
01:58:36,592 --> 01:58:38,659
Seriously? Yeah.

1954
01:58:38,661 --> 01:58:40,461
I got to talk to the kid.

1955
01:58:40,463 --> 01:58:41,762
I'll be close behind.

1956
01:58:41,764 --> 01:58:43,097
How about a loose follow?

1957
01:58:43,099 --> 01:58:46,734
All right? Boundaries are good.

1958
01:58:50,538 --> 01:58:51,939
Sorry I took your suit.

1959
01:58:51,941 --> 01:58:53,407
I mean, you had it coming.

1960
01:58:53,409 --> 01:58:54,942
Actually, it turns
out it was the perfect

1961
01:58:54,944 --> 01:58:56,910
tough-love moment
that you needed, right?

1962
01:58:56,912 --> 01:58:58,712
To urge you on?
Wouldn't you think?

1963
01:58:58,714 --> 01:59:00,381
Don't you think? I guess.

1964
01:59:00,383 --> 01:59:01,782
Let's just say it was.

1965
01:59:01,784 --> 01:59:04,385
Mr. Stark, I really--

1966
01:59:04,387 --> 01:59:06,720
You screwed the pooch hard,
bigtime.

1967
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:08,856
But then you did
the right thing.

1968
01:59:08,858 --> 01:59:10,624
Took the dog to the free clinic,

1969
01:59:10,626 --> 01:59:12,626
you raised the hybrid puppies.

1970
01:59:12,628 --> 01:59:15,729
All right, not my best analogy.

1971
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:17,898
I was wrong about you.

1972
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:20,100
I think, with a little
more mentoring,

1973
01:59:20,102 --> 01:59:23,003
you could be a real asset
to the team.

1974
01:59:24,406 --> 01:59:26,006
To the-- to the team?
Yeah. Anyway,

1975
01:59:26,008 --> 01:59:28,509
there's about 50 reporters
behind that door.

1976
01:59:28,511 --> 01:59:30,411
Real ones, not bloggers.

1977
01:59:30,413 --> 01:59:32,446
When you're ready,

1978
01:59:32,448 --> 01:59:34,448
why don't you try that on?

1979
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:35,916
And I'll introduce the world

1980
01:59:35,918 --> 01:59:38,819
to the newest official
member of the avengers:

1981
01:59:38,821 --> 01:59:41,021
Spider-man.

1982
01:59:42,724 --> 01:59:43,924
I-- heh.

1983
01:59:45,928 --> 01:59:48,996
Yeah, give that a look.

1984
01:59:53,568 --> 01:59:54,835
So after the press conference,

1985
01:59:54,837 --> 01:59:57,204
Happy will show you
to your room, your new quarters.

1986
01:59:57,206 --> 01:59:59,673
Where's he between?
He's next to vision?

1987
01:59:59,675 --> 02:00:01,508
Yeah, vision's not big on doors.

1988
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:03,710
It's fun. Or walls.

1989
02:00:03,712 --> 02:00:06,113
You'll fit right in.

1990
02:00:11,719 --> 02:00:14,521
Thank you, Mr. Stark,

1991
02:00:14,523 --> 02:00:15,689
but I'm-- I'm good.

1992
02:00:15,691 --> 02:00:18,659
You're good? How are you good?

1993
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:21,829
Well, I mean,
I'd rather just stay

1994
02:00:21,831 --> 02:00:23,230
on the ground
for a little while.

1995
02:00:23,232 --> 02:00:25,466
Friendly neighborhood
spider-man.

1996
02:00:25,468 --> 02:00:28,135
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1997
02:00:28,137 --> 02:00:29,770
You're turning me down?

1998
02:00:29,772 --> 02:00:32,573
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1999
02:00:32,575 --> 02:00:33,707
Look at me.

2000
02:00:33,709 --> 02:00:35,876
Last chance. Yes or no?

2001
02:00:35,878 --> 02:00:37,010
No. Okay.

2002
02:00:37,012 --> 02:00:38,245
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,

2003
02:00:38,247 --> 02:00:40,180
working-class hero
vibe that I dig.

2004
02:00:40,182 --> 02:00:42,716
Ah, Happy will take you home.

2005
02:00:42,718 --> 02:00:43,917
Yeah? Yeah.

2006
02:00:43,919 --> 02:00:47,754
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

2007
02:00:48,089 --> 02:00:49,156
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

2008
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:50,958
Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

2009
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,894
See you around. Okay.

2010
02:01:00,902 --> 02:01:02,236
That was a test, right?

2011
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:04,771
There's nobody back there?

2012
02:01:04,773 --> 02:01:05,906
Yes, you passed.

2013
02:01:05,908 --> 02:01:08,041
All right, skedaddle there,
young buck.

2014
02:01:08,043 --> 02:01:09,910
Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.

2015
02:01:09,912 --> 02:01:12,079
Yeah, thank you.

2016
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:16,116
Told you he was a good kid.

2017
02:01:17,952 --> 02:01:21,221
Pepper! Pepper!

2018
02:01:21,223 --> 02:01:22,189
Where's the kid?

2019
02:01:22,191 --> 02:01:23,624
He left. Everybody's waiting.

2020
02:01:23,626 --> 02:01:25,692
He actually made
a really mature choice.

2021
02:01:25,694 --> 02:01:27,594
It just surprised
the heck out of us.

2022
02:01:27,596 --> 02:01:28,795
Did you guys screw this up?

2023
02:01:28,797 --> 02:01:30,230
He told the kid
to wait in the car.

2024
02:01:30,232 --> 02:01:32,866
Are you kidding me? I have
a room full of people waiting

2025
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:35,569
for some big announcement.
What am I gonna tell them?

2026
02:01:35,571 --> 02:01:38,238
Think of something.
How about, um,

2027
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,641
Hap, you still got that ring?

2028
02:01:40,643 --> 02:01:41,241
Do i-- i--

2029
02:01:41,243 --> 02:01:42,809
The engagement ring.
Are you kidding?

2030
02:01:42,811 --> 02:01:46,747
I've been carrying
this since 2008.

2031
02:01:48,316 --> 02:01:49,116
Okay.

2032
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:51,184
I think I can think of
something better than that.

2033
02:01:51,186 --> 02:01:54,621
Well, it would buy us
a little time.

2034
02:01:55,223 --> 02:01:56,590
Like we need time.

2035
02:01:56,592 --> 02:01:58,892
I can't believe you have
that thing in your pocket.

2036
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:00,594
Let me to get the door
for you, hon?

2037
02:02:00,596 --> 02:02:03,730
I got it.

2038
02:02:17,145 --> 02:02:21,281
Aunt May,
did you do dinner already?

2039
02:02:30,959 --> 02:02:33,093
May?

2040
02:02:53,815 --> 02:02:54,815
What the f--?!

2041
02:05:09,183 --> 02:05:12,152
Look who it is.

2042
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,521
What are the odds
you and I'd end up

2043
02:05:14,523 --> 02:05:16,957
at the same summer camp?

2044
02:05:16,959 --> 02:05:17,924
Relax.

2045
02:05:17,926 --> 02:05:20,093
This? It's not on you.

2046
02:05:20,095 --> 02:05:23,430
It's on our
little spider friend.

2047
02:05:23,432 --> 02:05:25,398
I've got some boys
on the outside

2048
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,334
who would love to meet him.

2049
02:05:27,336 --> 02:05:28,535
You know, take a picture,

2050
02:05:28,537 --> 02:05:31,204
slice his throat,
put his head in a dryer.

2051
02:05:31,206 --> 02:05:34,841
And I heard a rumor...

2052
02:05:36,911 --> 02:05:39,513
You know who he is.

2053
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:44,785
If I knew who he was,

2054
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:47,387
he'd already be dead.

2055
02:05:50,525 --> 02:05:54,928
Toomes, your family's here!

2056
02:12:32,526 --> 02:12:35,762
Hi, I'm captain America,
here to talk to you

2057
02:12:35,764 --> 02:12:37,530
about one of the most
valuable traits

2058
02:12:37,532 --> 02:12:40,433
a soldier or student can have.

2059
02:12:40,435 --> 02:12:41,501
Patience.

2060
02:12:41,503 --> 02:12:43,937
Sometimes Patience
is the key to victory.

2061
02:12:43,939 --> 02:12:45,872
Sometimes it leads
to very little

2062
02:12:45,874 --> 02:12:48,675
and it seems like
it's not worth it.

2063
02:12:48,677 --> 02:12:50,543
And you wonder

2064
02:12:50,545 --> 02:12:51,711
why you waited so long

2065
02:12:51,713 --> 02:12:55,315
for something so disappointing.

2066
02:12:58,285 --> 02:13:01,254
How many more of these?
