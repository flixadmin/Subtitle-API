1
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,901
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,272
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,905
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,412
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,545
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,129
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,833
What had brought colour and joy

8
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:54,389
could also bring darkness
and destruction.

9
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:58,342
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer:

10
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:03,811
She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,

11
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:08,977
he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,733
The young lord
set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:18,738
But what he did next only sealed it.

14
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:27,621
Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.

15
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:31,927
But in their faces, he saw only horror:

16
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,515
He was banished from the city forever:

17
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,885
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,896
Someday he would return

19
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:46,931
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:21,308
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:27,391
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

22
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,440
China will be mine.

23
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:42,780
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

24
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,827
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,828
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,167
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,663
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

28
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,252
Thirty-three. Stop him!

29
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:55,671
- Thirty-four.
- it's too dangerous!

30
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,168
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

31
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:00,007
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

32
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:02,637
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,976
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,687
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,149
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,527
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:17,813
Do it.

38
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,402
No problem!

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,156
Yeah!

40
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,701
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:29,370
Yeah!

42
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,585
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,585
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:38,960
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,052
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,892
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:04,113
Inner peace.

48
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,614
Inner peace.

49
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,705
Inner peace.

50
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,291
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,167
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,261
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:26,474
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

54
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,050
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

55
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,225
What are you doing?

56
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:35,814
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,088
Awesome!

58
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:11,184
How did you do that?

59
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:15,351
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

60
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:19,856
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:25,864
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

62
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:30,198
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,368
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

64
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,208
Or?

65
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,831
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,377
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

67
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,380
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,802
By far.
Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:55,353
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,977
- OK.
- ...I have ever experienced.

71
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:06,067
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

72
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:11,827
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:14,534
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:16,830
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:20,417
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,545
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,506
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:25,755
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,928
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,176
Danger.

81
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:34,262
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:36,807
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,604
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,481
Snack stops.

85
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,359
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:57,990
Get all the metal you can find!

87
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,326
Grab the metal!

88
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:11,169
Help, help, help, help. Help!

89
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,633
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

90
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,926
Oh, no.

91
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,269
Wings of Justice!

92
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,453
The Dragon Warrior!

93
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,920
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,001
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,880
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,380
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

97
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,951
Take that!

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,967
Po! Incoming!

99
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,963
Thanks, Mantis!

100
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:55,233
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

101
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,073
Feet of Fury!

102
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,919
Tigress! Monkey!

103
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:14,048
Viper! Mantis!

104
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,045
Bunny! What?

105
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,044
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,134
Help!

107
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,229
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

108
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:48,953
Is everyone OK?

109
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,542
That was awesome!

110
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:55,330
I got this.

111
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:07,925
Po!

112
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,735
Chew on that, tubby!

113
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,243
Help.

114
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,654
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

115
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,000
I think I saw...

116
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:33,493
I think...

117
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,082
I gotta go.

118
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:42,668
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,591
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:47,517
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:51,389
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

122
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:56,024
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

123
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,523
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

124
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,030
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

125
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:06,114
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,611
He doesn't work here any more.

127
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:12,289
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

128
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:13,954
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

129
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,159
Po!

130
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,789
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

131
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:22,209
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,628
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

133
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:29,308
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:35,647
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

135
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,690
With purchases.

136
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:41,478
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:45,273
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,111
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,117
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,867
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

141
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,710
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,835
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

143
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,329
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,757
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,880
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,763
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,716
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

148
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,517
Mom? A baby?

149
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:19,058
- Dad?
- What...?

150
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,233
How do I say this?

151
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,731
Where did I come from?

152
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:35,408
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,252
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:43,629
I know it's not.

155
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:49,091
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,051
OK.

157
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:55,055
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:00,225
...adopted.

159
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:02,227
- I knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,355
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,365
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,407
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,414
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

164
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:20,576
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:27,342
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

166
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,134
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:34,425
I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.

168
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:37,305
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

169
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,100
Only there were no radishes.

170
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,689
Just a very hungry baby panda.

171
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,273
There was no note.

172
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,488
Of course, you could have eaten it.

173
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:56,652
I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.

174
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,638
I brought you inside.

175
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,524
Fed you.

176
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,689
Gave you a bath.

177
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,692
And fed you again.

178
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,787
And again.

179
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,667
And tried to put some pants on you.

180
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:56,210
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever:

181
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,511
To make my soup without radishes.

182
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:05,933
And to raise you as my own son.

183
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:10,318
Xiao Po, my little panda.

184
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:15,859
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

185
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:18,192
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,365
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,709
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:31,374
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:35,759
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,921
It was imported, too.

191
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:41,266
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:50,473
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,152
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:56,068
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

195
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:58,908
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:01,484
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,322
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,659
And who am I?

199
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:16,757
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,930
Good.

201
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:25,303
Better. Elbow.

202
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,470
Straighten it out!

203
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,461
Shen?

204
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,585
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:03,504
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,805
- Your house?
- Yes.

207
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,467
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

208
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,597
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,935
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,110
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,821
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:29,491
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,334
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

214
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:36,333
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,757
I'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,762
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

217
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,969
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,675
You want to see? it's a gift.

219
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,636
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

220
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,356
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:59,474
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

222
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,646
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,169
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,178
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,303
I agree.

226
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,181
But this is.

227
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,907
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,403
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,149
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:53,282
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,496
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:56,865
That's impossible.

233
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,499
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,171
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,749
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:11,262
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:15,801
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,893
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:21,893
OK, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,774
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

241
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,569
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,651
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:34,196
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,624
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:44,544
Peace on.

246
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,755
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

247
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:49,049
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,305
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,724
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:02,099
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:04,149
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,189
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

253
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,901
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:13,905
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:16,486
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:20,910
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:24,952
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:28,297
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:32,168
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:36,095
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

261
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:38,840
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

262
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:42,305
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
it's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:45,434
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:48,065
You're my son.

265
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:51,854
Right?

266
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:56,284
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,783
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,329
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

269
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:10,041
Noodles.

270
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,305
Come on, guys, let's go!

271
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,673
Yeah!

272
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,057
Yeah...

273
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:26,982
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,807
Mama?

275
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:56,112
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,604
Mom! Dad!

277
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,865
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,323
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,530
But I thought...

280
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:10,625
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:14,832
- Radish?
- it's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,881
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,259
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:24,338
Wait!

285
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,595
No.

286
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:42,825
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:53,203
Inner pea...

288
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,085
Pea...

289
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,128
Inner peace.

290
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:22,313
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

291
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,238
I'm... training.

292
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,703
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,745
- I am ready.
- OK.

294
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,916
So serious.

295
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:50,716
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:55,602
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,101
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,148
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,103
Again!

300
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:11,030
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:13,957
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:17,117
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,999
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

304
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,129
No. Besides...

305
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,137
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:36,265
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:40,975
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:44,860
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,733
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:51,285
Yeah.

311
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,822
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,999
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,125
Souls of platinum.

314
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,493
Like you.

315
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,629
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:10,176
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,841
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,139
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:18,430
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,977
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

321
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,984
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,192
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,521
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,905
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

325
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:33,744
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,869
Gongmen City.

327
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,759
My father's throne.

328
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,969
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:02,640
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:08,767
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,069
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:14,526
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

333
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:18,201
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

334
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,073
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

335
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,282
Perfect!

336
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:27,664
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

337
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:35,596
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,424
We move out in three days,

339
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:41,430
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

340
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:46,225
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:47,431
Fortune?

342
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:51,319
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:55,862
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:01,112
If you continue on your current path...

345
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:07,456
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:11,964
I see...

347
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,752
I see...

348
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,963
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:22,141
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:23,342
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:26,141
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

352
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:28,307
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:32,653
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:36,313
But if you really want
to see the future...

355
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,862
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,620
A peacock...

357
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:54,001
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

358
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:57,211
Nothing has changed.

359
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,306
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,681
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:11,138
Who?

362
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,318
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

363
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,861
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

364
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,658
Big and furry.

365
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:23,993
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:27,782
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:31,292
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

368
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,333
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:38,377
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,296
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:44,302
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

372
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:48,306
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:52,846
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,853
Will you stop that!

375
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:12,125
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,832
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

377
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,045
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:19,208
and we are here
to bring you to justice"!

379
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:25,306
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:33,387
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,438
I do not like that guy.

382
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,230
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,898
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:10,556
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

385
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:14,394
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,728
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,820
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,991
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:33,905
OK.

390
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,415
Guys! Guys?

391
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,300
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:45,963
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,592
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:51,172
...gold in there, come on!

395
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:53,798
This rice is raw!

396
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,516
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

397
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:59,856
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

398
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:02,777
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

399
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:05,436
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

400
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,654
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- ...two...

401
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,023
..one.

402
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,826
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:24,538
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:26,424
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,052
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

406
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,387
Oh, no, not me.
it's not safe to speak here.

407
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:33,015
Right.

408
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,885
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:41,432
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,233
What? They're still alive?

411
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:45,394
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

412
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,275
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

413
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,108
OK, let's go!

414
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,368
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

415
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:54,817
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

416
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:57,240
- Get them!
- Sorry!

417
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,577
Take that!

418
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,329
- Keep going!
- Faster!

419
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:03,410
Hey, stop!

420
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,601
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

421
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:26,856
Surround him.

422
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:30,774
Now!

423
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:32,692
Gotcha!

424
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,988
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,948
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

426
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,072
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

427
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,710
Then search there!

428
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:52,132
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,296
Sorry, Po. it's just me.

430
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,465
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:02,894
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,357
Cute, huh?

433
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:16,194
Nice work, Po.

434
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,283
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

435
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,623
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,165
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,293
Master Ox! Master!

438
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,003
The ferocious Master Croc!

439
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,342
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:41,177
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,344
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:46,142
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:50,401
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

444
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,562
We're coming for you, Shen!

445
00:34:58,147 --> 00:35:01,280
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,198
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

447
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:05,081
Of course we do.

448
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:09,081
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,044
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

450
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:13,005
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:17,801
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:21,719
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

453
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:24,465
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:29,224
...by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,723
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

456
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:34,392
from telling me
something's unstoppable!

457
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,624
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,666
I'd like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:57,630
You guys see that?
it's called being awesome.

460
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,676
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

461
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,597
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

462
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:10,887
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

463
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,359
Yes!

464
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,520
All right, let's go!

465
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:19,609
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:25,948
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

467
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,830
You...

468
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,169
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

469
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,790
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

470
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:42,170
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

471
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,971
With despair for dessert.

472
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:47,306
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

473
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:51,390
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

474
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:52,939
Yeah!

475
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:57,183
Monkey?!

476
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,066
You! You're mine!

477
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:02,196
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

478
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,283
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

479
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,324
Get him!

480
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,581
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

481
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,793
Stop him!

482
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,077
Faster!

483
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:23,667
Yeah! Go, go!

484
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,344
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

485
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:30,342
- Viper!
- Hang on!

486
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:42,529
- What?
- Watch out!

487
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:47,191
Uncool! Very uncool!

488
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,285
Try this!

489
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:51,700
Guys, guys, guys!

490
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,539
Maybe something smaller!

491
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,211
No, no! Oh, no, no.

492
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,513
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

493
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:19,857
Fire!

494
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,067
We've lost them.

495
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,036
Again! Again!

496
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,410
Crane, catch!

497
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:39,909
Gotcha!

498
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,214
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

499
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,931
Mantis, now!

500
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:11,195
Ls that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

501
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:13,610
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

502
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:17,947
Your turn!

503
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:23,620
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

504
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,762
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

505
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:46,435
Yes! Taste the defeat!

506
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,987
Let me tell you something.

507
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:51,155
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

508
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:02,749
Guess nobody told you,

509
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:05,837
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

510
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:10,207
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

511
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,047
We surrender!

512
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:22,812
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

513
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,472
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

514
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:28,817
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

515
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,364
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

516
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,783
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

517
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:39,695
These are the best cuffs!

518
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:44,876
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

519
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,080
No, no, no...

520
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:55,381
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

521
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,045
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

522
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:03,307
- You are afraid for a reason.
-I am not afraid.

523
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:06,231
He is coming to me in chains.

524
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:08,890
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

525
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:14,396
Don't even think about it.

526
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,505
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

527
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,997
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

528
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,250
This plan's nothing like that plan.

529
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:37,550
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

530
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:52,101
Keep moving.

531
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,356
Ah, my old enemy...

532
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,948
...stairs.

533
00:42:35,265 --> 00:42:38,480
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

534
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:41,064
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

535
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,653
Someone might want to clean that up.

536
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,495
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

537
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:47,241
Greetings, panda.

538
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:49,739
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

539
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:52,871
Hey.

540
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:56,046
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

541
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:58,920
Hey... enough with the poking around.

542
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:01,845
Strong. Healthy.

543
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,681
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

544
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:07,304
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

545
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:10,181
The beard threw me.
it's kind of misleading.

546
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:13,439
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

547
00:43:13,595 --> 00:43:15,267
Bring the prisoners to me.

548
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,067
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

549
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:19,774
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

550
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:25,399
Sparrow kick!

551
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:30,621
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

552
00:43:39,788 --> 00:43:43,050
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

553
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,387
I do not. I know he is.

554
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,134
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

555
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:54,811
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

556
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,227
I did not have a lifetime.

557
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:58,357
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

558
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:03,236
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

559
00:44:03,394 --> 00:44:05,898
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

560
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,484
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

561
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,235
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

562
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:13,538
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

563
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,950
Know what? What's so funny?

564
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:19,247
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

565
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,337
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

566
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:26,843
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

567
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:30,014
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

568
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,889
The only reason you are still alive

569
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,854
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

570
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:42,359
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

571
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,402
Who do you think you are, panda?

572
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,277
Who do you think I am, peacock?

573
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:58,034
Why are we laughing?

574
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:00,248
Take aim.

575
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,343
Fire.

576
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,185
Well, light the... thing!

577
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,982
I did!

578
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:28,613
Fear the bug!

579
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:39,125
Get the weapon!

580
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,002
Tigress!

581
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,240
You... You were there.

582
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:20,367
Yes. Yes, I was.

583
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:31,383
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

584
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,427
Fire!

585
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,222
Oh. No, he's got way more.

586
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:49,945
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

587
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,524
Coming!

588
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,815
- Watch out!
- Po!

589
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:00,991
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

590
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,134
Use the ropes.

591
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,023
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
-I got it, I got it!

592
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,817
Bring it down!

593
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,569
- We're trapped!
- This way!

594
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,448
Goodbye!

595
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:45,828
Fire!

596
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,705
Get back!

597
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,755
The only way out is up.

598
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:00,884
What?

599
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,358
Follow me! Come on!

600
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,275
Where are they going?

601
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:19,283
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

602
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,083
Here we go!

603
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,103
- You idiot!
- My nose!

604
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,686
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

605
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:58,479
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

606
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,527
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

607
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,370
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

608
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,284
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

609
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,452
Happy New Year, sir.

610
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:19,545
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

611
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:20,798
Now!

612
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,880
Now, now, now, now, now!

613
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,843
Move! Move, move, move, move!

614
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,866
This way.

615
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,074
Let's go.

616
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,333
Oh, you!

617
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,747
What did you do?
it's chaos up there.

618
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,585
What happened to stopping Shen?

619
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,677
Yeah.

620
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,256
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

621
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,556
I meant for him to get away.

622
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:12,680
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

623
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:17,766
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

624
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,436
That makes no sense.

625
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,273
What do you mean? Sure it does.

626
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:25,781
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

627
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,991
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

628
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:30,700
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

629
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:32,660
The truth.

630
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:39,793
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

631
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,503
- Real far.
- What?

632
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,799
You're staying here.

633
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,711
Wait! I have to go ba...

634
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,930
You're staying here!

635
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:57,639
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

636
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,186
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

637
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,071
Guys? Don't.

638
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,319
Ready.

639
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,981
Look!

640
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:21,922
Stay down.

641
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:26,634
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

642
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:31,338
He was there! OK?

643
00:51:31,503 --> 00:51:34,718
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

644
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:38,512
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

645
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:41,145
Who I am.

646
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:46,819
Look, I'm going.

647
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:49,856
I have to know.

648
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:52,074
The hard core can't understand.

649
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:53,953
Tigress, no!

650
00:51:58,113 --> 00:52:00,118
The hard core do understand.

651
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:04,459
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

652
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:09,963
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

653
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,055
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

654
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:16,884
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

655
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,851
You're better off here.

656
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:32,902
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

657
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:36,068
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

658
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:39,200
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

659
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:41,747
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

660
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:47,256
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

661
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:49,880
Then will you finally be satisfied?

662
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,262
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

663
00:52:54,794 --> 00:52:58,804
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

664
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:04,435
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

665
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:07,609
It is time to stop this madness.

666
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:10,563
Why on earth would I do that?

667
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,945
So your parents can rest in peace.

668
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,737
My parents hated me.

669
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,825
Do you understand?

670
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:26,373
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

671
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:27,827
They loved you.

672
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:32,750
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

673
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:41,136
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

674
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,027
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

675
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:53,813
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

676
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:56,695
Happiness must be taken.

677
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:00,700
And I will take mine.

678
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:25,353
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

679
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:29,600
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

680
00:54:29,763 --> 00:54:34,069
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

681
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:38,857
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

682
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:40,529
I can't feel my face.

683
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:58,963
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

684
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:01,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

685
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:03,098
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

686
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:05,674
You! Where are you going?

687
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:11,223
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

688
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,447
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

689
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:40,753
Greetings, panda.

690
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:47,350
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

691
00:55:47,506 --> 00:55:50,520
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

692
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:53,690
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

693
00:55:54,597 --> 00:55:58,393
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

694
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,150
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

695
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:14,753
Here's your New Year's gift.

696
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:17,079
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

697
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:21,339
Po? What's he doing here?

698
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:23,507
Return it! Return it!

699
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:38,104
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

700
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:41,859
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

701
00:57:04,624 --> 00:57:06,345
We got them. Go!

702
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:29,571
You looking for me?

703
00:57:36,572 --> 00:57:38,375
I said that too soon, didn't I?

704
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:47,965
Po!

705
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:54,267
Po, get away from him.

706
00:57:54,423 --> 00:57:56,393
I'll get up. Here we go.

707
00:57:59,178 --> 00:58:01,859
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

708
00:58:02,014 --> 00:58:04,019
Now... answers.

709
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:06,947
Oh, you want to know so badly.

710
00:58:07,561 --> 00:58:10,776
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

711
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,997
Fill some crater in your soul?

712
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:17,323
Well, here's your answer.

713
00:58:17,488 --> 00:58:20,585
Your parents didn't love you.

714
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:23,503
But here...

715
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:26,341
...let me heal you!

716
00:58:32,336 --> 00:58:34,139
No!

717
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:51,206
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

718
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,719
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

719
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:03,843
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

720
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:07,224
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

721
01:00:09,515 --> 01:00:11,069
What is this place?

722
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:15,235
I'm surprised you remember so little.

723
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:18,860
But you were so little when it happened.

724
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:26,705
Perhaps you do remember.

725
01:00:26,866 --> 01:00:28,871
What? it's just a stupid nightmare.

726
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:31,122
Nightmare? Or memory?

727
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:04,701
This was a thriving village.

728
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:08,409
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

729
01:01:08,574 --> 01:01:10,413
But he wanted more.

730
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:16,342
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

731
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:20,460
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

732
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,063
Get them all!

733
01:01:41,815 --> 01:01:45,113
Take our son and run away! Go!

734
01:01:58,665 --> 01:02:02,295
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

735
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:10,300
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

736
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:13,594
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

737
01:04:13,756 --> 01:04:16,307
It is the rest of your story.

738
01:04:17,135 --> 01:04:19,306
Who you choose to be.

739
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,842
So, who are you, panda?

740
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:04,520
I am Po.

741
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:08,278
And I'm gonna need a hat.

742
01:05:17,695 --> 01:05:20,660
Such sad, sad faces.

743
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,541
But now is a time only for joy.

744
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:27,758
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

745
01:05:29,998 --> 01:05:34,009
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

746
01:05:34,169 --> 01:05:38,345
you and your precious kung fu will die.

747
01:05:40,509 --> 01:05:45,432
Then China will know to bow before me.

748
01:05:45,597 --> 01:05:47,270
Set sail!

749
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,950
What is that?

750
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:23,602
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

751
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,773
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

752
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,686
...then she'd eat my head.

753
01:06:28,848 --> 01:06:31,268
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

754
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:35,990
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

755
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:47,909
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

756
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:49,828
Fire!

757
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:00,926
You coward!

758
01:07:10,848 --> 01:07:11,940
Po?

759
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:15,395
Po?

760
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,617
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

761
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:33,626
Shen!

762
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:37,844
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

763
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:39,586
What?

764
01:07:39,752 --> 01:07:43,762
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

765
01:07:43,922 --> 01:07:45,595
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

766
01:07:45,758 --> 01:07:49,020
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

767
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:51,265
Disc of Destruction!

768
01:08:02,357 --> 01:08:05,287
OK. Take aim!

769
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,217
Ready?

770
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:41,113
You can't follow me.

771
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,362
Just get him!

772
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:49,408
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

773
01:08:56,661 --> 01:08:58,049
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

774
01:08:58,204 --> 01:08:59,248
No, don't shoot!

775
01:08:59,414 --> 01:09:01,834
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

776
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:09,216
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

777
01:09:08,005 --> 01:09:10,888
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

778
01:09:17,056 --> 01:09:19,524
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

779
01:09:24,855 --> 01:09:27,074
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

780
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:29,404
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

781
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:31,324
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

782
01:09:31,487 --> 01:09:32,531
Po!

783
01:09:32,696 --> 01:09:34,832
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

784
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:41,414
Nice!

785
01:09:43,999 --> 01:09:45,340
Viper, Puppet of Death!

786
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:47,087
Tigress!

787
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:57,766
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

788
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:00,433
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

789
01:10:00,599 --> 01:10:03,447
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

790
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:12,278
Master Shifu!

791
01:10:14,613 --> 01:10:16,950
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

792
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:28,795
Crane!

793
01:10:29,753 --> 01:10:31,675
Wings of Justice!

794
01:10:33,757 --> 01:10:34,967
Yeah!

795
01:10:41,097 --> 01:10:42,141
What?

796
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:56,243
I love you guys.

797
01:11:05,163 --> 01:11:06,835
Why aren't we firing?

798
01:11:06,998 --> 01:11:10,426
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

799
01:11:12,211 --> 01:11:15,177
Fire! Fire at them!

800
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,434
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

801
01:11:19,594 --> 01:11:20,637
Fire!

802
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:24,308
No.

803
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:33,232
Po!

804
01:12:08,809 --> 01:12:09,936
Tigress?

805
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:01,496
As you wish.

806
01:13:01,653 --> 01:13:03,290
Let's finish this.

807
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,180
Fire!

808
01:13:33,226 --> 01:13:35,065
Inner peace.

809
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:03,548
Again!

810
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,890
Yeah!

811
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,147
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

812
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:40,752
What? No. No!

813
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:50,396
Keep firing! Keep firing!

814
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:12,537
Skadoosh.

815
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:44,111
How did you...?

816
01:15:45,523 --> 01:15:47,160
How did you do it?

817
01:15:50,987 --> 01:15:53,621
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

818
01:15:53,781 --> 01:15:56,960
Not that. How did you find peace?

819
01:15:57,118 --> 01:16:00,795
I took away your parents. Everything.

820
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:03,340
I scarred you for life.

821
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,470
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

822
01:16:07,628 --> 01:16:11,638
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

823
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:14,219
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

824
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:18,810
-I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

825
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:22,900
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

826
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:27,569
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

827
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,155
You're right.

828
01:16:29,316 --> 01:16:31,701
Then I choose... this!

829
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:26,715
That was pretty hard-core.

830
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:37,141
- Po!
- You did it!

831
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,397
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

832
01:17:40,553 --> 01:17:44,231
It seems you have found inner peace.

833
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:46,727
And at such a young age.

834
01:17:46,893 --> 01:17:48,779
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

835
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:13,426
What do you mean he's not here?
it's my son's birthday.

836
01:18:13,586 --> 01:18:15,971
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

837
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,894
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

838
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:21,897
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

839
01:18:22,053 --> 01:18:23,441
When do you think he'll be back?

840
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:30,401
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

841
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:33,907
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

842
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:36,283
At least, I was his dad.

843
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:40,073
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

844
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:43,950
But why? He's just one little panda.

845
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:03,261
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

846
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:05,649
Yep.

847
01:19:05,804 --> 01:19:08,105
Well, I knew you would.

848
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:10,021
That's why I had new signs made.

849
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:12,438
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

850
01:19:12,603 --> 01:19:15,106
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

851
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:16,660
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

852
01:19:16,815 --> 01:19:19,496
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

853
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:24,366
There's something I should tell you.

854
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:31,584
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

855
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:36,671
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

856
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:38,472
You did?

857
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:43,222
-I know who I am.
- You do?

858
01:19:45,218 --> 01:19:46,855
I'm your son.

859
01:19:52,976 --> 01:19:54,613
I love you, Dad.

860
01:19:55,645 --> 01:19:57,531
I love you, too, son.

861
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:03,620
Delicious, fat radishes!

862
01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:05,914
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

863
01:20:06,072 --> 01:20:07,828
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

864
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:09,414
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

865
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:11,711
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

866
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,171
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

867
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,374
- Po.
- Dad.

868
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,011
- Po!
- OK.

869
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,800
Let's both cook. Together.

870
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:21,254
Together.

871
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,011
No, I'll cook.

872
01:20:57,915 --> 01:21:00,335
My son is alive.
