00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
Well, this is the same problem.

166
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,280
Same fucking union convenor.

167
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,760
Area convenor for the boiler makers
union has got involved with something

168
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,760
that could've otherwise been fixed
with a drink and a bribe.

169
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,080
-A wire cutting shop?
-Hmm,

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
and all the wire cutters here are women,

171
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
that's why the union convenor thinks
they're being underpaid.

172
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,920
Well, tell him

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,920
there are no men in the cutting shop
so there can be no comparatives.

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,960
-It's a woman.
-What is?

175
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,800
The union convenor
causing all the trouble.

176
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Fuck.

177
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,360
Her name's Jessie Eden.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,720
-You heard of her?
-Yeah.

179
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
Do you want me in the meeting?

180
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
No.

181
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560

182
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,200
Look,

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,640
sometimes I have a sniff of snow,
so what?

184
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
How's your mother?

185
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,080
I drove past her house,
the drainpipe was hanging off.

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
Very long hours these days
and when I do sleep

188
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,320
I dream about what happened.

189
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,760
I wasn't asking about you,
Michael, was I?

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,960
I was asking about your mother.

191
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,880
Since she was pardoned
she's been on these fucking tablets

192
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,040
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

193
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,200
She says that
when she was inside the noose

194
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
she saw spirits.

195
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
She's running séances

196
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,000
but people just come into the house
to steal things.

197
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,720
-Tommy, it's bad.
-All right, all right.

198
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,800
All right, listen to me, Michael.

199
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
The spirits she sees...

200
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,120
are real.

201
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Believe they're real.

202
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,600
Believe it with her.

203
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,240
And eventually,

204
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,880
you can take the remembered noose

205
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,560
from around her neck,

206
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,080
like a horse
that's been choked off.

207
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,520
Keep her off whiskey,

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,840
throw away the tablets,

209
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,920
and stop giving her fucking snow.

210
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,680
Fuck, Tommy,
sounds like family advice.

211
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,280
You coming back?

212
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Nothing to come back to.

213

217

Don't let your mother
keep cash in the house. And oi,

Yeah, I saw you at the back.

-Your turn of phrase...
-Is unacceptable?

328
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,520
You grew up mean you say.
Threat in there I think somewhere.

329
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,760
No threats.

330
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
The whole of Birmingham
knows you, Mr Shelby.

331
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,760
Sweetheart,

332
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,680
whatever you've heard

333
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
I don't need to make threats.

334
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
My comrade brothers and sisters...

335
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

336
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,640
I will conduct myself as a businessman.

337
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,840
Who says sweetheart.

338
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,760
You say there's a ten shilling disparity
between male and female cutters

339
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,440
in two of my factories.

340
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,400
Very well.

341
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,080
I will increase the pay
of the female cutters

342
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
in this factory by five shillings

343
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,920
and I will cut the pay
of the male cutters

344
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,400
in the Rover by five shillings,

345
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,160
thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

346
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,280
And I will tell the men

347
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,760
with families to feed

348
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,880
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

349
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,520
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

350
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
Oh, yeah?
A week after Christmas, you think so?

351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
You know, everything
you've said here today

352
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,280
and the fact that
we're having this meeting today

353
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,840
tells me that you're a woman
without a family.

354
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,120
And everything I hear about you tells me
you're a man without a family as well.

355
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,160
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

356
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,680
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

357
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
as soon as Boxing Day.

358

You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

359

I've heard
lots of whistles blow, sweetheart.

361
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

362
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm sorry to keep asking

363
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,240
but chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

364
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,280
He's new,

365
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,600
he's foreign, he gets very upset.

366
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Right. Well, you tell chef

367
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,760
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

368
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,240
Twenty-seven?

369
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,160
-Family?
-Yep.

370
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,120
I thought Charlie could do
with some company

371
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
so I asked Johnny Dogs
if he knew anyone who liked to eat goose

372
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,000
and he said he knew 26.

373
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Tell chef I want ten geese,
a buck cut into steaks,

374
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,600
some trout from the river,

375
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,600
fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar, best we have.

376
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
There will be children?

377
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
Lots of children.

378
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,880
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor,

379
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,240
so have...
have mops and buckets ready, eh?

380
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,600
And I want you at the table, Frances,
so make it 28.

381
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
I will be busy.

382
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,520
You've put up with me this past year,

383
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business,

384
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,160
tomorrow you will eat at my table.

385
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,200
Things will get better,
I think, next year.

386

Uh-huh.

is always in the papers.

And, uh, what do you get up to
all day, Arthur?

As you know Arthur's previous endeavours
have left us with no need for a salary.

-Oh.
-Yeah, well, something to do.

I wanna open a garage.

-Someday.
-Fixing cars, you know?

403
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Sometimes cars attract ambitious men.

I just got served a black hand.

412

I just got delivered
a black fucking hand to the house

413
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,400

means among the wops, Arthur?

And what's the purpose of your visit?

487
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,960
Pleasure.

488
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,640
Mum? It's me.

489
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,600
-Left the door open.
-To change the air.

490
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,360
I told you I was busy today,
what do you want?

491
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,480
Why haven't you opened your post?

492
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,000
Tidied up.

493
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,200
Ada's coming today.

494
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,840
She's late.

495
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,040
Tommy asked about you today.

496
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

497
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

498
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,720
Yeah.

499
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,080
Bentleys are no good in the cold.
You should tell him.

500
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,360
(SIGHS) I will.

501
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,280
Any other messages for Tommy?

502
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
Yeah, fuck off.

503
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,200
He saw that your drainpipe was broken.

504
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,520
He's worried.

505
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,880
Is that it?
Is that all he asked about, drainpipes?

506
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,360
No, he said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

507
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,040
That you've always had a gift.

508
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,200
What gift?

509
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,920
Second sight.

510
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,320
Spirits, all that gypsy stuff.

511
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,760
He said that I'm to believe you.

512
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,440
You think I don't hear
his voice in yours?

513
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,440
You don't think
I recognise his strategies?

514
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,120
-I'm still a match for him.
-Yes,

515
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,520
you are.

516
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,160
And you still can be.

517
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,920
Me and Lizzie decided

518
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
that this new year
we're all to turn a page.

519
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
You can't spend
another year like this, Mum.

520
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
Mum.

521
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,080
Mum.

522
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
Word is like a bullet to me.

523
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,320
See your sister in that chair sometimes.

524
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,320
Look,

525
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,160
me and Lizzie decided.

526
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,520
It's time.

527
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,200
I bought these.
One for you and Ada...

528
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,720
One for you and me.

529
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,040
So Tommy said, keep her off the whisky?

530
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,240
I'll drink champagne

531
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,200
the day my son leaves the employment
of Shelby Company Ltd.

532
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,320
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

533
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,320
Right, now, this is your job, Charlie.

534
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,000
Now, give those to Santa,

535
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
and Rudolf.

536
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
Good boy.

537
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,200
Leave this out for Santa,
that's whisky.

538
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,080
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

539
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right? Sleep well.

540
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Come on, Charlie.

544
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

545
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,440
I know. Send her in.

546
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,000
I've had a card, Ada. I'm guessing
Arthur and John have had one as well.

547
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,440
"Hello, Tommy."
"Hello, Ada, welcome home."

"Thanks, it's nice
to be back." (CHUCKLES)

549
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,440
I've spoken to Moss.

550
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Moss says that Changretta
is a soldier for the Spinetta family,

551
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,960
which means that he'll have men
with him, professional men.

552
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,000
They usually operate
in units of around ten.

553
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,880
Moss is checking Cunard records
to see if they're already in England.

554
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,400
This one's for you.

555
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
What is it, a time machine?

556
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,520
My God, Tommy Shelby, is that regret?

557
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
I'll open it tomorrow.

558
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,960
So, boss, in light of the changed
circumstances, what are your orders?

559
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,760
Changretta knows where we all live.

560
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,840
If we stay out in the open, isolated,
he'll pick us off one by one.

561
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,480
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

562
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
You mean, back home?

563
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,680
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

564
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

565

Finn's already there.

568
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,720
You tell Polly and Michael,
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

569
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,200
And Esme and Linda?

570
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,640
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

571
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,760
needs to come where it's safe.
These bastards will kill kids as well.

572
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,320
When this business is finished we can...

573
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,120
go our separate ways.

574
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,160
Go and see Polly and explain.
She'll have had a card as well.

575
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
Do you think I'm on the list?

576
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
We're all on the list, Ada.

577
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,080
I gave my gun to Arthur.

578

-Yeah.

598
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,560
My tablets were in the bathroom cabinet.
What did you do with them?

599
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I threw them in the lavatory.

-Tommy's orders?
-No. My own decision.

How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them? They close everything.

-They don't open anything.

You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

It's okay. It's okay, we can sit.

I'm really sorry
to bother you again, sir,

what time the guests will arrive.

Frances, for the last time,

635
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,480
it's Johnny Dogs,

636
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,800
they're gypsies,

637
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,240
they're camped down by the river.

638
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,720
When they're ready they'll walk up.
All right?

639
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,320
-He says it's about preparation, sir.
-What is?

640
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,720
He's asked specifically,

641
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,120
will they arrive
before the King's speech or after?

642

-October.

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,480
-He's Italian, sir.
-Oh.

647
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,760
He's the best chef
we've ever had in the house.

648
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,960
No shouting or swearing or blaspheming.

649
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,400
-Do we know his references?
-Yes.

650
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,720
The only problem has been his assistant.

651
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,280
What assistant?

652
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,600
He brought an assistant with him,
he calls him his sous chef.

653
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,280
Are they still working, Frances?

654
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

655
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,640
All right, thank you.
Goodnight, you can go to bed.

656
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,440
Merry Christmas, sir.

657
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,120
And I thought about your offer,

658
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,120
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

659
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,720
All right, thank you.

660
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,880
Mr Shelby.

661
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,960
What's your name?

662
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,720
-Max, Mr Shelby.
-Max.

663
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,080
It's all right, don't get up.

664
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,200
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sir.

665
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,800
You knew I'm Mr Shelby?

666
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
Hello, sir.

667
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,960
I haven't taken time
to introduce myself.

668
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,200
Antonio.

669
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,080
What have you done that's so wrong, eh?

670
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,840
Excuse me?

671
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,480
Sous chef, peeling potatoes?

672
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,080
It's an emergency, late notice.

673
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,480
Oh, late notice.

674
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,760
All right.

675
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,680

677
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,040
Here, £10.

678
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,520
For the late notice.

You wanted to know
if my guests would arrive

681
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,800

682
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,240
-Eh?
-Yeah.

683
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
It'll be after.

684
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,120
How are you?

685
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
Just... worried about tomorrow.

686
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,800
Yeah, I'm worried about Antonio.

687
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,960
He's been here two months
and we've not met before, it's my fault.

688
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,880
I've been busy.

689
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,200

-My hand has blood.
-Oh, mine too.

691
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,680
Hey, how much do you pay Antonio?

692
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,120
I forget.

693
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,160
Must be a lot.

694
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,800
I just gave him £10,

695
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,320
didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

696
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,200
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

697

702
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,480
I used to know the man
that owns San Marco's.

703
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,160
A man called Darby Sabini?

704
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,080
-I've never met him.
-No.

705
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,680
Maybe your, um, assistant...

706
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Antonio, maybe he's met him.

707

-Here's how it is.
-(GRUNTS)

708
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,800
-Antonio was sent from New York?
-I don't know, please.

709
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,640
Darby Sabini facilitated.

710
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,200
He passed him onto you,
told you to bring him into my house,

711
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,360
threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

712
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,080
Do you want me to dress you
like you dressed that fucking stag?

713
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,720
Please, don't...

714
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,160
-You know about me?
-Mmm-mmm.

715

All right.

-You know what I do?
-Mmm.

717
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,800
You wanted to know
when my guests would arrive

718
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,600
'cause Antonio needed me alone.

719
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,240
He's an assassin,
the plan is to kill me tomorrow.

720
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,800
I don't know.

721
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,480
They just said bring him here.

722
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,400
Well, bring him here.

or a number, what did he fucking say?

733
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,600
What did he fucking say?

he picked the wrong side in this war.

we're coming for him.
