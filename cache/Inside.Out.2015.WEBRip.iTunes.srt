1
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,594
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,805
"What is going on inside their head?"

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,559
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

4
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,106
And there she was...

5
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,650
Hello.

6
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,778
Riley.

7
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,699
Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

8
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,711
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

9
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,779
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

10
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,621
Er, for 33 seconds?

11
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm Sadness.

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,379
Hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,841
Can I just... If you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

14
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,343
And that was just the beginning.

15
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,263
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

16
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,226
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

17
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,144
Sharp turn! No! Look out! No!

18
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,523
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

19
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,026
Easy, easy. We're good. We're good.

20
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,779
-Good job.
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

21
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,905
And we're back!

22
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,245
Here we go. All right, open.

23
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,830
-This looks new.
-You think it's safe?

24
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,914
What is it?

25
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,251
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

26
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,294
Hold on. What is that?

27
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,420
This is Disgust.

28
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,006
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

29
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,424
Physically and socially.

30
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,509
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

31
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,635
Hold on, guys.

32
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,970
It's broccoli!

33
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,180
Yucky!

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,684
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

35
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,645
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

36
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,064
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

37
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,274
That's Anger.

38
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,444
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

39
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,280
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

40
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:02,826
Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

41
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,124
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

42
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,294
Airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

43
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,587
Airplane.

44
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,849
And you've met Sadness.
She... Well, she...

45
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,272
I'm not actually sure what she does.

46
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,775
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

47
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,903
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,947
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,157
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

50
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,790
But the really important ones
are over here.

51
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,169
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called Core Memories.

52
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,381
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,759
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

54
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,428
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

55
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,721
-We got a future center here!
-Nice job.

56
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,986
And each Core Memory

57
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,905
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

58
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,283
Like Hockey Island.

59
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,245
Goofball Island is my personal favorite.

60
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,415
Come back here, you little monkey!

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,001
You're silly.

62
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,378
Yep, Goofball is the best.

63
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,255
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

64
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,553
I love Honesty Island.
And that's the truth!

65
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,264
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

66
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,896
The point is, the Islands of Personality
are what make Riley...Riley!

67
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,439
Look out, mermaid!

68
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,780
Lava!

69
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,119
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong!

70
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,622
-Hey! Very nice!
-Where'd you learn that?

71
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:17,794
Brain freeze!

72
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,636
Yeah!

73
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,767
-Good night, kiddo.
-Good night, Dad.

74
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,483
And...we're out!

75
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,320
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

76
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,571
Nice job, everybody!

77
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,156
Let's get those memories
down to Long Term.

78
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,374
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

79
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,600
And that's it. We love our girl.

80
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,853
She's got great friends
and a great house.

81
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,813
Things couldn't be better.

82
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,650
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

83
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,403
What...

84
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,285
Okay, not what I had in mind.

85
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,062
Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge!
Isn't that great?

86
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,481
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

87
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,983
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

88
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,569
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

89
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,322
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

90
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,823
Yeah...

91
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,409
-Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
-For Pete's sake! Move it!

92
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,661
These are my kind of people.

93
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,497
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

94
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,624
Step on it, Daddy!

95
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,292
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

96
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,919
We've already been in it forever.

97
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,712
Which, actually, was really lucky,

98
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,422
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

99
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,716
what our new house
is going to look like!

100
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,219
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,011
-That looks safe!
-That one's nice.

102
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,556
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

103
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,892
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

104
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,269
That's the one! It comes with a dragon.

105
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,356
Now we're getting close, I can feel it.

106
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,110
Here it is, here's our new house. And...

107
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,661
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

108
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,168
-We're supposed to live here?
-Do we have to?

109
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,128
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

110
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,296
Can you die from moving?

111
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,715
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

112
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,800
A dead mouse!

113
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,635
-Great. This is just great.
-I'm gonna be sick.

114
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,637
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

115
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,888
Get off of me!

116
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,640
Hey. All through the drive,

117
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,684
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

118
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,768
Let's go check it out!

119
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,894
-Let's go!
-It's gonna be great!

120
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:21,979
Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,188
No, no, no, no, no.

122
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,648
I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

123
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,775
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

124
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,110
Riley can't live here.

125
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,278
-She's right.
-It's the worst.

126
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,654
-Really bad.
-It's absolutely the worst.

127
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,323
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

128
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,993
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

129
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,328
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

130
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,413
Where did you read that?

131
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,831
It doesn't matter. I read it and it's great.

132
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,250
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

133
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,669
-The hockey lamp goes there.
-Put the chair there.

134
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,047
-The trophy collection goes there.
-Stars! I like that!

135
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,675
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving van!

136
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,510
All right. Goodbye.

137
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,471
Well, guess what? The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

138
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,973
You're kidding.

139
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,517
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

140
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,311
That figures. The van is lost.

141
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,854
You said it would be here yesterday!

142
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,480
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

143
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,773
Mom and Dad are stressed out!

144
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,525
-They're stressed out?
-What are we going to do?

145
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,861
I've got a great idea!

146
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,447
Did you even read the contract?

147
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,991
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

148
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,201
Hey!

149
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,327
No, you're not!

150
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,369
She's lining up for the shot!

151
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,537
Coming behind you.

152
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,956
-Watch out! Watch out!
-She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

153
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,211
Come on, Grandma!

154
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,337
"Grandma"?

155
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,214
She put her hair up, we're in for it!

156
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,717
Hey, put me down!

157
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,306
Sorry. Hold on. Hold on.

158
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,642
Hello?

159
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,726
Wait. Wh...

160
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,936
You're kidding.

161
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,564
All right. Stall for me. I'll be right there.

162
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,068
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

163
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,779
-I got to go.
-It's okay. We get it.

164
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,239
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

165
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,074
See you, sweetie.

166
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,451
Dad just left us.

167
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:04,414
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

168
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,584
Joy? What are you doing?

169
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,336
Just give me one second.

170
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,841
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

171
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,762
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

172
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,888
Maybe we could try that?

173
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,348
Pizza sounds delicious.

174
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,058
-Pizza? That's good.
-Yes! Pizza!

175
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,771
-What the heck is that?
-Who puts broccoli on pizza?

176
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,439
That's it. I'm done.

177
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,568
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

178
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,945
First the Hawaiians and now you!

179
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,241
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

180
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,535
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

181
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,913
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

182
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,958
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

183
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,168
That was disgusting.

184
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,711
Good. Family is running.

185
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,962
Dad's got a steel stomach.

186
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,132
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

187
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,884
Spitting out the car window!

188
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,343
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

189
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,428
Wearing a seat belt!

190
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,722
What about the time with the dinosaur?

191
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,890
-That's the one.
-Definitely!

192
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,558
Say cheese!

193
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,143
-Dad! Dad!
-Honey!

194
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,769
-Now hold still.
-The car!

195
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,023
Stop! No, no, no!

196
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,233
Nice one, Joy.

197
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,986
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

198
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,370
Wait. What? What happened?

199
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,582
She did something to the memory.

200
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,584
What did you do?

201
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,835
I just touched it.

202
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,754
-That shouldn't make it change.
-Change it back, Joy!

203
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,172
-I'm trying.
-You can't change it back?

204
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,257
-No! I guess I can't!
-Good going, Sadness.

205
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,677
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

206
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,307
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

207
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,685
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

208
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,607
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

209
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,859
-Okay.
-All right. Get ready.

210
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,571
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

211
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,205
Wait, what? What happened?

212
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,875
-A Core Memory!
-No!

213
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,213
Sadness, what are you doing?

214
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,633
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

215
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,059
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

216
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,561
-Joy!
-Whoa, whoa.

217
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,731
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

218
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,192
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

219
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,320
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

220
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,239
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

221
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,491
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

222
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,202
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

223
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,496
-No, you're not.
-And annoying.

224
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,417
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

225
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,087
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

226
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,382
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

227
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,427
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

228
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,723
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

229
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,766
Yeah, that's not...

230
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,435
What about that time with Meg

231
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,689
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

232
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,110
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

233
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,404
It was awful.

234
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,156
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

235
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,365
What are your favorite things to do?

236
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,701
My favorite?

237
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,745
Well, I like it when we're outside.

238
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,623
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

239
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,667
Like that time we buried Dad
in the sand up to his neck.

240
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,253
I was thinking more like rain.

241
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,633
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

242
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,551
We can stomp around in puddles.

243
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,930
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

244
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,808
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

245
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,895
And we get all cold, shivery,

246
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,856
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

247
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,025
Hey, hey. Hey, easy.

248
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,818
Why are you crying?

249
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,364
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

250
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:10,160
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

251
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,872
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

252
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:17,918
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

253
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,461
I've read most of them.

254
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,255
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

255
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,424
"Long Term Memory Retrieval,
Volume 47"?

256
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,802
-No.
-A real page-turner!

257
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:30,681
"Long Term Memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

258
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,392
See? Fun already! You lucky dog.

259
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,104
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

260
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,825
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

261
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,537
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

262
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,874
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night!

263
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,208
-I know. I know.
-Be right there!

264
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,502
We've got to land this, okay?

265
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,882
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

266
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,137
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

267
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,722
There are no bears in San Francisco.

268
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,891
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

269
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,226
I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

270
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,603
I don't want to hear about your nerves.

271
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,687
I'll tell you what it is.

272
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,647
This move has been a bust.

273
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,899
That's what I've been telling you guys!

274
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,568
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

275
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,403
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

276
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,405
I can't believe
Mom and Dad moved us here!

277
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,741
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

278
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,159
But we've been through worse!

279
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,036
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

280
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,829
Riley should be happy about.

281
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,749
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

282
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,876
-Pizza is weird here.
-Our friends are back home.

283
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,586
And all of our stuff is in the missing van!

284
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,421
Come on. It could be worse.

285
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,382
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

286
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,512
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

287
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,265
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

288
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,600
Let us handle this.

289
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,102
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

290
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,938
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

291
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,689
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

292
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,275
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

293
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,277
-It's a good one!
-Now hold on!

294
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,280
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

295
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,448
Hi, honey.

296
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,577
The Mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot-toot!

297
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,579
Still no moving van.

298
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,123
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

299
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,290
Toot-toot-toot!

300
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,376
Where's Dad?

301
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,587
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

302
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,130
I rest my case!

303
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,924
Your dad's a little stressed,

304
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,843
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

305
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,554
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

306
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,475
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

307
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:43,480
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

308
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,315
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

309
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,151
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

310
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,698
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

311
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,450
We can do that for him. Right?

312
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,329
Well.

313
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,291
Yeah, sure.

314
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,543
What did we do to deserve you?

315
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,340
-Sweet dreams.
-Good night.

316
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,011
Well, you can't argue with Mom.
Happy it is.

317
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,387
Team Happy! Sounds great!

318
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,555
Totally behind you, Joy.

319
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,892
Looks like we're going into REM.

320
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,853
I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to Long Term.

321
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,857
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, Team Happy!

322
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,527
All right, what's on tonight,
Dream Production?

323
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,243
Well, this is it. The new place.

324
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,832
Come live with me, Riley.

325
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,627
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

326
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,253
-Eat me!
-I'm organic!

327
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,133
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

328
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,177
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

329
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,476
We are not going to
end the day like this.

330
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,855
Don't you worry.

331
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,942
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

332
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,777
I promise.

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,916
Hello! Did I wake you?

334
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,042
Do you have to play that?

335
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,335
Well, I have to practice.

336
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,005
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

337
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,717
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

338
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,094
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

339
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,220
Here it is! Fear.

340
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,806
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

341
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,099
on the first day at a new school.

342
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,476
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

343
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,897
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

344
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,815
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

345
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,984
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

346
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,110
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

347
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:38,071
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long.

348
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,823
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

349
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,201
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

350
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,579
Train of Thought! Right on schedule.

351
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,541
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

352
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,752
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

353
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:52,836
It might come in handy.

354
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,172
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

355
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,798
Which it probably will be.

356
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,511
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

357
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,721
-Really?
-Follow me.

358
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,267
-What are you doing?
-And there. Perfect!

359
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,394
This is the circle of Sadness.

360
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:13,857
Your job is to make sure that
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

361
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,777
So you want me to just stand here?

362
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,072
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

363
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,618
Just make sure that
all the Sadness stays in the circle!

364
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,955
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

365
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,206
-No.
-Atta girl.

366
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,457
All right, everyone, fresh start.

367
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,584
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

368
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,837
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

369
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:38,257
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

370
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,884
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

371
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,261
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

372
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,971
Very cute!

373
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,639
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

374
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,558
Mom and Dad? With us in public?

375
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,059
-No thank you.
-I'm on it!

376
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,603
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

377
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,938
Have a good day at school, monkey.

378
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,571
Have a great day, sweetheart!

379
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,282
-That's crazy. It really is.
-That was so funny.

380
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,201
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

381
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,245
Are you sure we want to do this?

382
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,039
-In we go!
-Okay! Going in! Yes!

383
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:15,919
Did you see her? Hello!

384
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,921
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

385
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,383
-How do you know?
-Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

386
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,093
Is she wearing eye shadow?

387
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,095
-Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
-Let's go talk to them!

388
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,763
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

389
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,140
We want them to like us.

390
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,558
Yeah. Wait, what?

391
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,560
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

392
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:35,105
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

393
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:38,525
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

394
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,986
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

395
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,323
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

396
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,284
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

397
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,620
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

398
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,787
Don't worry. I got this.

399
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,916
Okay.

400
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,542
My name is Riley Andersen.

401
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,795
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

402
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,425
And how about Minnesota?

403
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,885
Can you tell us something about it?

404
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,012
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

405
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,141
She's hilarious!

406
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,311
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

407
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,813
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

408
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,107
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

409
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,152
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

410
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,738
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

411
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,657
It's kind of a family tradition.

412
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,408
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

413
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,164
Or we did, till I moved away.

414
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,290
-Hey, what gives?
-Wait, what?

415
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:39,586
Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

416
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,338
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

417
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,965
Get back in your circle.

418
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,467
-What's going on? Why won't it eject?
-Get it out of there, Joy.

419
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,720
We used to play tag and stuff.

420
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:49,847
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

421
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,890
-Did you see that look?
-No.

422
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:52,975
They're judging us!

423
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,562
Somebody help me!
Grab that... Everybody put...

424
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,649
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

425
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,196
No! We're crying! At school!

426
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,741
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

427
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,578
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

428
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,831
It's a Core Memory!

429
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,583
But it's blue.

430
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,880
No! Wait! Stop it! No! No!

431
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,013
Joy, no.

432
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,514
-That's a Core Memory!
-Hey!

433
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,391
-Joy, wait!
-Stop it! Let go!

434
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,185
The Core Memories!

435
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,409
No, no, no, no!

436
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,924
Thank you, Riley.

437
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,468
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

438
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,012
but we're happy to have you here.

439
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,181
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

440
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,308
and turn to chapter seven.

441
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,395
Can I say that curse word now?

442
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,545
No! One, two, three. Okay.

443
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,507
I got them. Where are we?

444
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,468
Long Term Memory? Wait...

445
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,394
Goofball Island?

446
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,357
Riley's Islands of Personality.
They're all down!

447
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,110
This is bad.

448
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,654
We... We can fix this!

449
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,531
We just have to get back
to Headquarters,

450
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,243
plug the Core Memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

451
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:21,665
Riley has no Core Memories.
No Personality Islands and no...

452
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,750
What? What is it?

453
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,835
You.

454
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,004
You're not in Headquarters.

455
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,423
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

456
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,925
We got to get you back up there.

457
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,969
I'm coming, Riley.

458
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:52,404
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for greens.

459
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,031
Like compost. And eggshells.

460
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,867
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

461
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,952
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

462
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:01,371
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down.

463
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:02,581
Joy would know what to do.

464
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,707
That's it.

465
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,627
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

466
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,048
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

467
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,175
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

468
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,470
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

469
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:20,516
And get this: try-outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

470
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,059
-Hockey?
-What do we do?

471
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,560
Guys, this is...

472
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:24,937
You pretend to be Joy.

473
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,855
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

474
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,109
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

475
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,987
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

476
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,281
-Because I'm not Joy.
-Yeah, no kidding.

477
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,743
Did you guys pick up on that?

478
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,745
-Something's wrong.
-Totally.

479
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:42,996
Should we ask her?

480
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,874
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

481
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,210
So, how was the first day of school?

482
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,419
She's probing us.

483
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,963
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

484
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,714
What? Okay.

485
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,760
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

486
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,555
Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

487
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,765
Something is definitely going on.

488
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,184
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

489
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,894
We're going to find out
what's happening.

490
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,229
But we'll need support.

491
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,272
Signal the husband.

492
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,445
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across...and nice!

493
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,242
She's looking at us.

494
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,412
-What did she say?
-What?

495
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,955
Sorry, sir. No one was listening.

496
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,374
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

497
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,293
What? What is it, woman? What?

498
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,503
He's making that stupid face again.

499
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,463
I could strangle him right now.

500
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,631
Signal him again.

501
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,095
So, Riley, how was school?

502
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,055
-You got to be kidding me!
-Seriously?

503
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:45,142
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

504
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,311
Move! I'll be Joy.

505
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,188
School was great, all right?

506
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,356
Riley. Is everything okay?

507
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,443
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

508
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,153
What is her deal?

509
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,863
All right, make a show of force.

510
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,448
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

511
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,450
No, not the foot!

512
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,785
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

513
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,412
I'll show you attitude, old man.

514
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,788
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

515
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,917
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

516
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,710
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

517
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,629
Take it to DEFCON Two.

518
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,672
You heard that, gentlemen.
DEFCON Two.

519
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,677
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

520
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,555
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

521
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,182
Yeah, well... Well...

522
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,518
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

523
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,479
Keys to safety position.

524
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,857
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

525
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,195
Just shut up!

526
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,822
Fire!

527
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,701
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

528
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,832
The foot is down! The foot is down!

529
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,838
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

530
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,881
Well, that was a disaster.

531
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,804
Come fly with me, gatinha.

532
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,944
We're going to walk out there? On that?

533
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,779
It's the quickest way back.

534
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,906
But it's right over the Memory Dump.

535
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,284
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

536
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:29,413
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

537
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:33,834
-Okay.
-It's not that high. It's totally fine...

538
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,100
Hey.

539
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:54,104
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

540
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,982
Do you want to talk about it?

541
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,277
Come on, where's my happy girl?

542
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:02,863
Monkey.

543
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,824
He's trying to start up Goofball.

544
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,452
Come on!

545
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,466
Go back! Run, run, run!

546
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,620
What...

547
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,721
I get it. You need some alone time.

548
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:13,976
We'll talk later.

549
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:19,273
We have a major problem.

550
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,358
Joy, where are you?

551
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:25,112
We lost Goofball Island.

552
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:29,908
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

553
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,536
You can fix this, right, Joy?

554
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,620
I...

555
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,206
I don't know.

556
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,375
But we have to try. Okay, come on.

557
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,753
Riley's gone to sleep.

558
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:45,883
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

559
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,093
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

560
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,262
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

561
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,890
We'll just go across Friendship Island.

562
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,685
We'll never make it.

563
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,020
-No!
-No, no, no!

564
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,479
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

565
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,356
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

566
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,942
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

567
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,571
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

568
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,990
Wait, Joy, you could get lost in there!

569
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,617
Think positive!

570
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,245
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

571
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,581
That's Long Term Memory.

572
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,167
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

573
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,753
I read about it in the manuals.

574
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,756
The manuals? The manuals!

575
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,674
-You read the manuals!
-Yeah.

576
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,885
So you know the way
back to Headquarters!

577
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:30,969
I guess.

578
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,098
You are my map!

579
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:38,852
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

580
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:42,648
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

581
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,734
Just give me a few...hours.

582
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,445
Which way? Left?

583
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,613
Right.

584
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:53,617
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

585
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,868
Okay.

586
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,079
This actually feels kind of nice.

587
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,499
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to Headquarters before morning.

588
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:04,169
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

589
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:10,467
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

590
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,010
Yeah, just another right.

591
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:17,599
And...a left and then another...left and...

592
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,060
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

593
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,896
Because we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

594
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,565
Riley's awake.

595
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,782
Don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

596
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:37,327
Sorry, I won't. Starting now.

597
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,705
I can't take much more of this.

598
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,331
Forget them!

599
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,833
-Mind workers!
-But, Joy, we're almost...

600
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,880
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

601
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,007
-Excuse me, hi.
-Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

602
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,135
-I need to find Friendship Island.
-Look at this.

603
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,678
Four years of piano lessons.

604
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,971
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

605
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,932
You know what? Save Chopsticks
and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

606
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,143
-Are you...
-U.S. Presidents. What do you think?

607
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,395
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

608
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,689
-Forget 'em!
-Hey! You can't throw those away!

609
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,065
Those are perfectly good memories.

610
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,401
The names of
every "Cutie Pie Princess" doll?

611
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:12,571
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, Honeypants...

612
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:13,906
Forget 'em!

613
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,870
Hey! Bring those back!

614
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,164
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

615
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,832
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

616
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,293
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

617
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,711
-Fades?
-Happens to the best of them.

618
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:31,590
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

619
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,759
-TripleDent gum
-Will make you smile

620
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,135
The song from the gum commercial?

621
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,638
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

622
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,098
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

623
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,934
Like a million times!

624
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,060
Let's watch it again!

625
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,728
TripleDent gum

626
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,731
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

627
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,982
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

628
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,067
Yeah!

629
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,610
Okay, here we go!

630
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:55,864
TripleDent gum

631
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,574
What the... This again?

632
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,245
Wait! Do you know
how to get to Friendship Island?

633
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,621
TripleDent gum

634
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,916
Do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

635
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,710
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

636
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:09,795
We won the first game.

637
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,089
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

638
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,092
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

639
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,635
She did not just say that.

640
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:19,513
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

641
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,181
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

642
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,308
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

643
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,686
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

644
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,145
It's like mind reading!

645
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,522
You like to read minds, Meg?

646
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,440
I got something for you to read,
right here!

647
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:31,859
Let's just be calm for one second!

648
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,319
-I heard they have parrots...
-I've got to go.

649
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:35,779
-What?
-I got to go!

650
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:41,368
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... Oh, no!

651
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,957
Friendship Island! What?

652
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,553
Not Friendship.

653
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,980
Riley loved that one. And now it's gone.

654
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:13,650
Goodbye, friendship. Hello, loneliness.

655
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,032
We'll just have to go the long way.

656
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:25,245
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

657
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:27,539
I'm ready.

658
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,084
There's got to be a better way.

659
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:34,713
Look at you!

660
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,675
I will take you, but not you.

661
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,761
Who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

662
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,971
Hello!

663
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,264
Wait! Hey! Wait!

664
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,227
Wait! Stop!

665
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,028
Excuse me.

666
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:01,573
I was looking for... Diversion!

667
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:03,534
-What?
-So long, sucker!

668
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,245
I hurt all over.

669
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,121
Wait. I know you.

670
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,750
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

671
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,210
No, no, no. I do.

672
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,046
Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

673
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,549
-You really do know me?
-Well, of course!

674
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,176
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

675
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,720
You would know. We're trying
to get back to Headquarters.

676
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,973
Headquarters?
You guys are from Headquarters?

677
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,142
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

678
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,894
You're Joy? The Joy?

679
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,563
What the heck are you doing out here?

680
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,731
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

681
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:37,776
Without you, Riley won't ever be happy.

682
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,237
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

683
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,322
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

684
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:43,407
Thank you!

685
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,117
It is so great to see you again.

686
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,411
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

687
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:50,497
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

688
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,416
I went to all of your concerts.

689
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,917
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

690
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,586
Watching you play tag was such a treat.

691
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,920
Two-time world champ.

692
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,630
And remember your rockets?

693
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,966
Of course! It runs on song power!

694
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,467
That's right! Your theme song!

695
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,927
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

696
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,262
Bing Bong
Bing Bong

697
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,680
His rocket makes
you yell "Hooray!"

698
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,473
-Bing Bong, Bing Bong
-Bing Bong, Bing Bong

699
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,934
What exactly are you supposed to be?

700
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:13,687
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

701
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,483
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

702
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,443
Dolphin?

703
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,490
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

704
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,451
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

705
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,161
That's all people
talked about back then.

706
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,788
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

707
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,250
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

708
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,794
So I, you know...

709
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,840
Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

710
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:44,009
Tell you what.
When I get back up to Headquarters,

711
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,053
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

712
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,472
-You will?
-Of course! She'd love that.

713
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:52,059
This is the greatest day of my life!

714
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:56,980
Are you okay?

715
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,484
-Hey, what's going on?
-I cry candy.

716
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,653
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

717
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,323
-Here, use this.
-Thanks!

718
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:07,407
Hold on, wait a second.

719
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:12,996
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

720
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,710
Here. What? It's imaginary.

721
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:21,797
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to Headquarters.

722
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,632
Walk? We're not walking.

723
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,801
We're taking the Train of Thought!

724
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,263
The train, of course!

725
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,849
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

726
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,642
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

727
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:34,810
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

728
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,856
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

729
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,108
I am so glad we ran into you!

730
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,403
The station is right through here.
After you.

731
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,863
-Joy.
-What?

732
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,032
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

733
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,618
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

734
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,871
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

735
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:57,541
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

736
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:01,378
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

737
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:07,342
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

738
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:09,595
Let's go around. This way.

739
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,388
Almost there!

740
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,850
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

741
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,894
But Riley needs to be happy.

742
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:19,730
I'm not missing that train.
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

743
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,690
He's part dolphin. They're very smart.

744
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,400
Well, I guess.

745
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,405
-What did you get?
-I don't know.

746
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,589
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

747
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,966
Loneliness.

748
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,593
Looks like there's something in there.

749
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,095
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

750
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,723
What did I tell you?
You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

751
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,392
Say, would you look at that?

752
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,104
-What's happening?
-Oh, no, they turned it on.

753
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,106
Never seen this before.

754
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:08,820
My face! My beautiful face!

755
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,989
-What is going on?
-We're abstracting!

756
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:15,160
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective Fragmentation!

757
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,328
All right. Do not panic.

758
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,789
What is important
is that we all stay together.

759
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,876
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

760
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,961
Run!

761
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,214
I can't feel my legs!

762
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,049
There they are.

763
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,342
Come here, me!

764
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,056
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

765
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,641
We'll get stuck here forever!

766
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,476
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

767
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,145
I told you, it's a shortcut!

768
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,814
The train!

769
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:51,280
Oh, no. We're two-dimensional!
That's stage three!

770
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,322
We're getting nowhere!

771
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:55,492
-Depth! I'm lacking depth!
-Come on.

772
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,872
We can't fit.

773
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,792
Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

774
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,627
We're not going to make it!

775
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:11,091
Wait! We're two-dimensional.
Fall on your face!

776
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,854
Stop! Stop!

777
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:28,275
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

778
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:31,278
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

779
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,197
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

780
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,573
How long until the next train?

781
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:38,452
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

782
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,622
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to Headquarters.

783
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,665
If we hurry, we can catch it.

784
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:46,043
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

785
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,504
Yeah!

786
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,380
Is there really another station?

787
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:51,590
Through there.

788
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,303
Welcome to Imagination Land!

789
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,639
-Imagination Land?
-Sure!

790
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:01,058
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

791
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:03,894
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fry Forest!

792
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,230
-Delicious.
-No way!

793
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,941
Check it out! Trophy Town!

794
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,069
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

795
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,821
I won first place!

796
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:17,658
-Me too!
-Participation award.

797
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:21,161
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's Cloud Town!

798
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,247
That is my favorite!

799
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:24,665
It's so soft!

800
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,458
Let me try.

801
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,335
Hey! What's the big idea?

802
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:31,129
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

803
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:34,633
Oh, no! Lava!

804
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,053
Imagination Land is the best!

805
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:42,015
Is it all going to be so interactive?

806
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,393
Hey, look! The House of Cards!

807
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:46,812
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

808
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,355
-Your rocket!
-Yeah.

809
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,148
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

810
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:52,651
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

811
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,654
-I'm sorry.
-Great.

812
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,823
I love Imagination Land.

813
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:00,659
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

814
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,496
Who the heck is that?

815
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,914
Imaginary boyfriend.

816
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,791
I would die for Riley.

817
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,794
-I've never seen him before.
-I live in Canada.

818
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,006
Anyway, this way.
Through Preschool World!

819
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,258
-We're nearly to the train!
-Riley, here we come!

820
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:23,015
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

821
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,391
These kids look pretty good,

822
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,143
considering they're from San Francisco.

823
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:27,477
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

824
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,606
-Got to go.
-Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

825
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:31,857
Luck isn't going to help us now.

826
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,692
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

827
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:37,112
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

828
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,990
One of these has got to work
in place of the Core Memory.

829
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:41,450
-She's about to play!
-Hurry!

830
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,752
We did it, gang! It's working!

831
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:59,009
Line change! Line change!
Change it up!

832
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,224
No! No!

833
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,439
It's like we don't learn anything.

834
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:14,525
-Come on!
-Let's pick it up out there!

835
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:17,027
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

836
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,031
-That's it!
-No, no, no! Breathe.

837
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,324
Find your happy place.

838
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,121
What's her problem?

839
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,463
-Riley. What's wrong?
-Let's go.

840
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:39,049
-You're not going to finish try-outs?
-What's the point?

841
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,426
Hey. It'll be all right. Let's just go back...

842
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,554
Stop saying everything will be all right!

843
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,057
Nice hustle, ladies!

844
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,441
Hockey?

845
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,074
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

846
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:06,410
-Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
-Hey!

847
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,370
Bing Bong,
we have to get to that station.

848
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:10,581
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham Cracker Castle.

849
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,834
Hey. That's weird. Graham Cracker
Castle used to be right here.

850
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,253
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

851
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:18,797
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here.

852
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,632
-Hey, what's going on?
-Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

853
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:22,259
-We'll have to come back.
-Princess Dream World!

854
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,098
Oh, no!
The stuffed Animal Hall of Fame!

855
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,726
My rocket!

856
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:33,645
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

857
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,231
It still has some song power left!

858
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,816
Who's your friend who likes to play?

859
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:48,035
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

860
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,411
Riley and I are going to the moon!

861
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,461
Riley can't be done with me.

862
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:07,262
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

863
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,264
We just need to
get back to Headquarters.

864
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:10,641
Which way to the train station?

865
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,227
I had a whole trip planned for us.

866
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:19,149
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

867
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,027
Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this!

868
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,240
Here's a fun game!

869
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:30,410
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

870
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,705
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

871
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,125
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

872
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:42,631
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

873
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:45,050
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

874
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:48,345
-Sorry.
-It's all I had left of Riley.

875
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:51,098
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

876
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:53,350
They were wonderful.

877
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:57,187
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

878
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,313
Sadness...

879
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,024
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

880
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:05,737
She did. We were best friends.

881
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,115
Yeah. It's sad.

882
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:21,879
I'm okay now.

883
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,216
Come on. The train station is this way.

884
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:34,266
How did you do that?

885
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,268
I don't know. He was sad.

886
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,603
So I listened to what...

887
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,063
Hey! There's the train!

888
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,036
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

889
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,790
Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions
look so similar.

890
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:01,418
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

891
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:08,425
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an F.

892
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:11,553
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

893
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:12,721
Like what, genius?

894
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,640
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

895
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:18,810
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

896
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:28,111
Emotions can't quit, genius!

897
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:32,032
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

898
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:34,201
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

899
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:41,708
-What is it?
-Nothing.

900
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,086
-Just the best idea ever.
-What?

901
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,755
All the good Core Memories
were made in Minnesota.

902
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,925
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

903
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,009
-Ta-da!
-Wait, wait, wait.

904
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,011
You're saying we run away?

905
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:54,471
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

906
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,182
I'd call it the Happy Core
Memory Development program.

907
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:58,559
You can't be serious.

908
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:00,060
Hey! Our life was perfect

909
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:04,022
until Mom and Dad decided
to move to San Fran Stinktown.

910
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,400
I mean, it's just so drastic!

911
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,652
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

912
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,405
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

913
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,533
-TripleDent gum
-Will make you smile

914
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,827
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

915
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:18,787
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

916
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:21,373
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

917
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,500
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

918
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,502
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

919
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:28,505
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

920
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:30,924
are just around the corner.

921
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,521
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

922
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:46,982
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

923
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:48,859
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

924
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,153
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

925
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:53,614
-We can't wait that long.
-How about we wake her up?

926
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:56,491
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

927
00:51:58,869 --> 00:51:59,953
How about we wake her up?

928
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,539
-Great idea, Joy.
-Thanks. Come on!

929
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:09,671
This place is huge!

930
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,174
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

931
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,844
I Can Fly? I love that one!

932
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,598
Rainbow Unicorn! She's right there!

933
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,604
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

934
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,482
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay?

935
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:31,485
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

936
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,947
I loved you in
Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7.

937
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,615
Okay, bye. I love you!

938
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:39,660
Wonder what that means.

939
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:40,911
Well, let's go in.

940
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,874
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

941
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,793
We've got a lot to work with here.

942
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,838
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

943
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:51,922
and quit hockey.

944
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:54,216
The writers have
put together a killer script!

945
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,426
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

946
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,095
I have to do stupid Dream Duty.

947
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,849
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

948
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:04,768
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

949
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:05,853
We could scare her.

950
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:08,188
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

951
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,273
-But, Joy...
-Sadness,

952
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,859
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

953
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:15,404
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

954
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:16,780
We'll excite her awake!

955
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,907
That's never happened before.

956
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,576
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

957
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:21,618
I don't think that'll work.

958
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,370
-Bing Bong?
-Yeah?

959
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:26,456
-Don't let anything happen to these.
-Got it.

960
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,960
Add the reality distortion filter.

961
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,882
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

962
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:36,592
Riley is the camera!

963
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:39,928
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

964
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:44,141
Hello, class.

965
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:47,686
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

966
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,479
Man, she is one bad actress.

967
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,315
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

968
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:56,570
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

969
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,739
Would you like to stand up

970
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,490
-and introduce yourself?
-Camera.

971
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,410
And cue Riley.

972
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,162
My name is Riley Andersen.

973
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,040
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

974
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:10,667
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

975
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,921
-That's disgusting.
-Gross!

976
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,548
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

977
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,468
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

978
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,512
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

979
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:22,679
Called it!

980
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:23,722
Ready?

981
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:27,059
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

982
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:28,644
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

983
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:32,064
Bark! Bark! Bark!

984
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:33,190
Who is that?

985
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:34,942
What's going on?

986
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,866
You're on! Go!

987
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,620
Let's party! Let's dance!

988
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,372
Hey, a party.

989
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:50,999
Bark, bark, bark!

990
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,001
Joy, this isn't working.

991
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,343
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

992
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:06,014
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

993
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,352
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

994
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:12,980
Hi, Riley, it's me!

995
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:14,481
-Who's your friend who likes to play?
-Bing Bong?

996
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:17,150
-Bing Bong, Bing Bong!
-Sadness, stop! It was working!

997
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,697
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

998
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,156
But look, it's working!

999
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,910
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1000
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:28,745
Stop right there!

1001
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:31,874
Pan away! Pan away!

1002
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,422
Pick a plotline!

1003
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,215
-Careful!
-Hold still!

1004
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,592
You can't do this!

1005
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:43,760
I know people in Headquarters!

1006
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,932
Cut that out! Please!

1007
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:53,103
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1008
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,980
No, no. No, no!

1009
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,107
There go the Core Memories!

1010
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:59,526
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1011
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:01,945
Come on.

1012
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,991
-What is this place?
-The Subconscious.

1013
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:09,995
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1014
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,124
My hat feels loose.

1015
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,751
How do we get in?

1016
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,128
-Let me see.
-You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1017
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,213
-Yeah, it's my hat.

1018
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,340
You sure? I don’t know,
look in the label.

1019
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,635
-Yeah, it says, "My hat."
-Wait, it says, "My hat"?

1020
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,470
-My hat, it says.
-That's what I wrote in my hat.

1021
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,055
-What are you talking about?
-You've got my hat on.

1022
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:29,556
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1023
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,142
-Hey! You!
-You caught us!

1024
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,437
Get back in there! No escaping!

1025
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,535
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1026
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,121
It's broccoli.

1027
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:57,501
The stairs to the basement!

1028
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,755
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1029
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:11,515
Okay, come on.

1030
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,477
-Would you walk quieter?
-I'm trying.

1031
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:16,854
What is going...

1032
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,023
Candy wrappers?

1033
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,328
-Bing Bong!
-Joy?

1034
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,371
-There you are.
-Shhh!

1035
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:42,838
It's Jangles.

1036
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,048
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1037
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,812
Do you have the Core Memories?

1038
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:02,482
Yeah. All he cared about was the candy!

1039
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,794
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

1040
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:27,049
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1041
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,300
But how?

1042
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:32,387
Oh, no!

1043
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:54,910
Hey, Sadness. Did you hear
about the party they were having?

1044
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:59,623
Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn't it a birthday party?

1045
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:02,167
Did you say birthday?

1046
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,753
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1047
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,004
And games and balloons...

1048
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,548
A birthday?

1049
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,550
Okay. Follow us!

1050
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,303
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1051
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:14,805
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1052
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:16,306
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1053
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:17,599
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1054
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,204
Who's the birthday girl?

1055
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,003
Come on, let's go!

1056
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:55,095
We made it!

1057
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,556
Guess who's on their way
to Headquarters!

1058
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,682
We are!

1059
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,233
-What is going on?
-He did it again!

1060
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:10,777
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1061
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:14,198
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw Bing Bong!

1062
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:17,534
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1063
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:20,370
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1064
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:22,080
Time to take action.

1065
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:23,790
Stupid Mom and Dad.

1066
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,043
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1067
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:27,377
Who's with me?

1068
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:30,631
No no no no no.

1069
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,342
Yeah. Let's do it.

1070
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:47,481
She took it. There's no turning back.

1071
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,192
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1072
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,277
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1073
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,445
and rent an elephant?

1074
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:54,738
Hey. That sounds nice.

1075
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,240
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1076
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,494
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1077
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,579
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1078
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,915
-Mom's purse.
-You wouldn't.

1079
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:07,668
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1080
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,213
-TripleDent gum
-No!

1081
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:14,508
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.

1082
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,301
They can pay to get us out.

1083
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:23,433
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1084
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:26,687
Look, there's Inductive Reasoning.
There's Déjà Vu.

1085
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,523
There's Language Processing.
There's Déjà Vu.

1086
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:32,192
There's Critical Thinking.
There's Déjà Vu.

1087
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,944
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1088
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:39,992
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1089
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,618
You're not so bad.

1090
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,870
Really?

1091
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:44,454
Nice work.

1092
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,083
I can't wait to get the old Riley back.

1093
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:50,961
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1094
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:52,296
Is this Riley?

1095
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:55,132
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1096
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,633
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1097
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,428
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1098
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:03,515
The hockey team showed up
and Mom and Dad were there cheering.

1099
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,268
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1100
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:08,645
I love this one.

1101
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,064
I love that one, too.

1102
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:13,609
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1103
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,446
Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1104
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:21,825
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1105
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:26,038
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1106
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:30,626
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1107
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:31,793
Okay.

1108
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,672
But I just don't understand.

1109
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,010
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

1110
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,558
Multiple customers?

1111
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,984
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1112
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:09,623
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

1113
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:16,380
Honesty Island?

1114
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,348
Look out!

1115
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:32,896
Come on!

1116
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:38,360
Hold on!

1117
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:42,531
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1118
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:55,669
That was our way home.

1119
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,797
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1120
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:02,134
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1121
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,385
What?

1122
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,763
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1123
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,975
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1124
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,685
Look. We have no Core Memories.

1125
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:13,270
You want Riley to be happy?

1126
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:15,939
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1127
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:20,194
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1128
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,113
Family Island. Let's go!

1129
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,339
Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous!

1130
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:42,549
We won't make it in time.

1131
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:47,304
But that's our only way back!

1132
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,360
A recall tube!

1133
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:06,114
We can get recalled!

1134
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:10,869
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1135
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:12,496
See you after school, monkey.

1136
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:14,164
We love you!

1137
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:19,503
Go! Run, run! Go!

1138
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:33,183
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1139
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,602
You're hurting Riley!

1140
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:37,479
No, no, no! I did it again!

1141
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:41,692
If you get in here,
these Core Memories will get sad.

1142
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,284
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1143
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,035
Joy?

1144
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:07,134
Joy!

1145
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:13,015
Joy!

1146
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:46,590
Joy?

1147
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,765
Joy!

1148
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,899
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1149
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:11,949
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1150
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,325
We're forgotten.

1151
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:24,253
We used to play tag and stuff.

1152
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,384
But everything's different now.

1153
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:34,346
Since we moved.

1154
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:10,924
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1155
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:23,687
I could listen to her stories all day.

1156
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:39,828
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1157
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:44,374
And now...

1158
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:45,102
It was the day the Prairie Dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1159
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,647
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1160
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,066
She wanted to quit.

1161
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,460
Sadness.

1162
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:14,965
Mom and Dad... The team...

1163
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:19,678
They came to help because of Sadness.

1164
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,561
We have to get back up there.

1165
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,564
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1166
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,442
We might as well be on another planet.

1167
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,200
Another planet.

1168
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:46,705
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1169
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:52,836
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1170
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,756
His rocket makes
you yell "Hooray!"

1171
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:02,346
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1172
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,557
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1173
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,267
His rocket makes
you yell "Hooray!"

1174
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:22,241
Hop in.

1175
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,914
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1176
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,124
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1177
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:34,044
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1178
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:37,089
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1179
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,091
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1180
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:41,718
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1181
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,018
Come on!

1182
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,271
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1183
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:54,606
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1184
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,608
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1185
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:58,193
Who's your friend who likes to play?

1186
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:13,250
Come on, Joy. One more time.

1187
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:15,669
I got a feeling about this one.

1188
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:18,130
Bing Bong, Bing Bong
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

1189
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,590
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1190
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,341
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1191
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:23,760
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1192
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,597
Louder! Joy, sing louder!

1193
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,765
To sing this song to say
Who's your friend who likes to...

1194
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,227
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1195
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,229
His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

1196
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,648
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1197
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:37,816
Bing Bong

1198
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,276
We're gonna make it!

1199
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,953
Bing Bong! We did it!

1200
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:53,707
We... Bing Bong? Bing Bong!

1201
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,376
You made it!

1202
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,963
Go! Go save Riley!

1203
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:06,678
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1204
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:22,569
I'll try, Bing Bong.

1205
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,115
I promise.

1206
01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:41,922
We're home!

1207
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:45,384
Riley? Riley!

1208
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:51,181
I'll call her cell.

1209
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:57,104
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1210
01:13:57,187 --> 01:13:58,397
Yep, let's cross the street.

1211
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:04,653
It's Mom. She's onto us!

1212
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:06,029
-What do we do?
-Where's my bag?

1213
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,531
Riley needs to get Core Memories.

1214
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,199
-That's the stuff.
-We keep going.

1215
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,745
Sadness!

1216
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,341
Sadness! Sadness?

1217
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:28,844
Come on, Sadness. Where are you?

1218
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:31,430
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1219
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:36,727
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1220
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,147
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1221
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:56,955
Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do?

1222
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,590
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1223
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,133
Let's get this idea out of her head.

1224
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,260
Sadness?

1225
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:14,973
-Sadness!
-Joy?

1226
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:16,600
Wait! Sadness!

1227
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:21,355
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1228
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,439
Come back!

1229
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:31,365
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1230
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:32,491
Was he with anyone?

1231
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:33,951
Yes! And there she is!

1232
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,410
Hey! Come back here!

1233
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,621
Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town.

1234
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,960
What? Sadness!

1235
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,380
I only make everything worse!

1236
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,674
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1237
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:00,394
-It's stuck!
-Great.

1238
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:02,729
-What do you mean it's stuck?
-Now what?

1239
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,439
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1240
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:14,992
-How do we stop it?
-I got it!

1241
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:16,785
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1242
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:18,912
-Brilliant!
-I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1243
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,998
Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1244
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,499
-Let me try.
-Great! You broke it!

1245
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:24,626
No, I didn't! Don't touch that!

1246
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:32,134
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1247
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,720
What have we done?

1248
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:38,640
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1249
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:41,101
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1250
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:42,853
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1251
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,567
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1252
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:51,195
I would die for Riley!

1253
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:08,504
That's it! I fold!

1254
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:43,664
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1255
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,336
I am positive this is crazy!

1256
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:56,093
-Now!
-For Riley!

1257
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,602
-Joy?
-Hang on!

1258
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,981
I wish Joy was here!

1259
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:17,573
It's Joy!

1260
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,700
Stand back!

1261
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:21,743
That worked.

1262
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:23,412
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1263
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:27,082
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1264
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:28,083
What?

1265
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,918
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1266
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,796
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1267
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,176
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1268
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,145
Thank goodness you're back!

1269
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,147
-Things are really messed up!
-We found this idea.

1270
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:52,065
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1271
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:03,619
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1272
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,370
Sadness, it's up to you.

1273
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:07,706
-Me?
-Sadness?

1274
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:08,957
I can't, Joy.

1275
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:11,627
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1276
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,681
Okay.

1277
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:47,996
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1278
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:00,217
All right. Thank you. We will.

1279
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,719
Her teacher
hasn't even seen Riley all day.

1280
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:03,887
-What?
-What was she wearing last?

1281
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,430
-Do you even remember what...
-I can't believe this.

1282
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:09,017
Riley, there you are! Thank goodness!

1283
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:11,478
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1284
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:13,605
Honey! What happened?
Are you all right?

1285
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:15,440
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1286
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:16,608
we talked to your teacher.

1287
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,657
I know you don't want me to but...

1288
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,326
I miss home.

1289
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:52,829
I miss Minnesota.

1290
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:59,503
You need me to be happy, but...

1291
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:05,634
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1292
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:09,513
I want to go home.

1293
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,433
Please don't be mad.

1294
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,147
-Sweetie.
-We're not mad.

1295
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:24,236
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1296
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:28,532
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1297
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:31,869
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1298
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,539
Spring Lake,
where you learned to skate.

1299
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,876
Come here.

1300
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:01,834
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1301
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:03,377
Friendship Island has expanded.

1302
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,046
Glad they finally opened
that Friendly Argument section.

1303
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:08,340
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1304
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:11,051
Fashion Island? Everyone shut up.

1305
01:24:11,134 --> 01:24:13,387
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1306
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:17,140
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1307
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:18,767
All right. Here you go.

1308
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:21,436
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1309
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:24,982
Cool! Upgrade!

1310
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:27,067
Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1311
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:29,945
Hey, guys? What's pub-er-ty?

1312
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,239
I don't know. It's probably not important.

1313
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:35,993
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1314
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:38,203
This new console is the...

1315
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:40,789
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1316
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:41,832
They're getting to the rink.

1317
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:45,544
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1318
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,296
-I know, Dad.
-But not too aggressive.

1319
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:50,132
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1320
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:53,177
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go Foghorns!

1321
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,764
-Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
-Okay! I got to go!

1322
01:24:57,848 --> 01:24:59,099
They love us.

1323
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:00,767
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

1324
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:03,312
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1325
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:07,149
She loved the face painting!

1326
01:25:07,191 --> 01:25:08,192
Told you it was a great idea!

1327
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:12,696
-Best idea he's had in a while.
-He's a really good guy.

1328
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:17,701
Just in case.

1329
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:19,995
Oh!

1330
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:22,623
Sorry.

1331
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:29,880
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1332
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:35,427
Okay. Bye.

1333
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,555
Remember, just hustle.

1334
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:42,226
-Go, Riley!
-You got this!

1335
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:46,396
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1336
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,565
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1337
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,151
All right, Anger, take it!

1338
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,402
Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1339
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:53,445
On our left. On our left!

1340
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:55,280
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1341
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:57,449
Mom and Dad are watching us fail.

1342
01:25:57,533 --> 01:25:58,951
Not for long!

1343
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,329
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1344
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:04,373
But we still love our girl.

1345
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:07,042
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1346
01:26:07,084 --> 01:26:08,544
Things couldn't be better.

1347
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:12,923
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1348
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:36,780
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1349
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:38,782
Anyone? Jordan?

1350
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:42,786
How much more of this?

1351
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,498
Five months, two weeks and four days
until summer vacation.

1352
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:50,210
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1353
01:26:50,294 --> 01:26:53,255
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1354
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:58,635
Have a nice day.

1355
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:00,888
What are we mad about?

1356
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:02,806
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1357
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:05,601
-What's Troy mad about?
-I don't know.

1358
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,728
I know. Totally.

1359
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:11,231
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1360
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:13,150
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1361
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:15,402
Being cool is so exhausting.

1362
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:20,991
Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello?

1363
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:26,580
Six years of drama school for this?

1364
01:27:26,663 --> 01:27:28,081
Move it, will you?

1365
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,628
What are you doing? Come on!

1366
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:34,338
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1367
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:36,673
We just need to go to our happy place.

1368
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:37,841
TripleDent gum

1369
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:39,510
No! Not this again!
