00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,010
It's you, you goof.

327
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,270
The bigger question is:

328
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,040
Why did Damien Darhk become an advisor

329
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,010
to Reagan's White House on
the eve of a nuclear treaty

330
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,310
with the USSR?

331
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,450
If his involvement with the Nazis in 1942

332
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,250
is any indication, he's working with

333
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,920
our time traveling nemesis.

334
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,290
It's the same person who killed Hourman.

335
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,820
Amaya needs to hear about this.

336
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,130
So she can also lose focus,

337
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,130
risking everything in a
selfish pursuit of revenge?

338
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,130
Do you have something you'd
like to say to me, Martin?

339
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,230
Yes, that killing Damien
Darhk almost 30 years

340
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,070
before his actual death will
have countless unforeseeable

341
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,940
effects on the history that we
are charged with protecting.

342
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,110
Well, what about protecting my sister?

343
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,050
She brought me back from the dead.

344
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,120
She risked everything for me.

345
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,390
How could I not do the same for her?

346
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,420
Because you answer to
a higher calling, Sara.

347
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm sorry, but we cannot stray
from our guiding principle.

348
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,600
Well, I'm sorry, too.

349
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,030
It sounds like you've never
really cared about anyone.

350
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,740
[whispering] Do you think I killed him?

351
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,140
I hope I didn't kill him.

352
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,140
He's gotta be in his late 70s at least!

353
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,380
Maybe he couldn't take the hit.

354
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,390
Oh, my God, I just killed a
member of the Justice Society.

355
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,850
Why are you whispering?

356
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,650
In case he's not dead,
he could probably use the nap.

357
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,260
- I'm not an invalid...
- [sighs]

358
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,030
Just old.

359
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,500
And you, you haven't aged a day.

360
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,870
It's one of the few
benefits of time travel.

361
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,140
So you left us to join
the loveable losers.

362
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
I was trying to find Rex's killer.

363
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,740
And you never thought to tell me?

364
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,010
I found Rex dying.

365
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,110
His last words were "time traveler."

366
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,780
I didn't think. I just acted.

367
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,250
What happened to them, Todd?

368
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,050
After the war, our friendship
with the Soviet Union ended,

369
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,420
and we continued fighting
as what was known as

370
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,290
the "Iron Curtain" descended
over central and eastern Europe.

371
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,760
Does "we" include my grandfather?

372
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,260
Right to the end.

373
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,230
In 1956, President Eisenhower

374
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,370
sent a team on a mission to Leipzig.

375
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,840
They never made it back.

376
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
Why didn't you go?

377
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,940
'56 was a charged time.

378
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,510
They were concerned that
I couldn't be trusted.

379
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,580
- Why not?
- Leave it be, Nathaniel.

380
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,750
Nate, Amaya, report
back to the Waverider.

381
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,360
I promise you, Todd, I will fix this.

382
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,960
What's done is done, Amaya.

383
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,200
Not when you have a time machine.

384
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm sorry for leaving, Todd.

385
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,230
I truly am.

386
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,940
Rex's killer is here? In 1987?

387
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,610
Potentially, if Damien Darhk
is still working with him.

388
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,580
No way, Damien Darhk
joined the Reagan Administration

389
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,650
as an advisor at the Reykjavík Summit?

390
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,220
And after the collapse of the summit,

391
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,290
Darhk was credited with
reviving the disarmament talks?

392
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,530
Darhk prefers stockpiling nukes,
not getting rid of them.

393
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,450
The nuclear treaty must be a cover.

394
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,480
For what purpose?

395
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,760
That's what we need to find out.

396
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,730
Gideon, where is Damien Darhk now?

397
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,530
I'm accessing the
calendar on his secretary's

398
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,300
IBM personal computer.

399
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,170
Mr. Darhk has a meeting in
Georgetown Park at 8:00 p.m.

400
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,440
Late night meeting in the park,
that's not suspicious.

401
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,340
Ray, take Mick. Find out who Darhk

402
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,110
is meeting with and why.

403
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,080
Wait, just us?

404
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,920
[sighs] Look, it's not a good idea

405
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,320
for me to be anywhere near
Damien Darhk right now.

406
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,790
I... I agree.

407
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,570
Okay, we're a go on audio.

408
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,970
Cutting it close, haircut.

409
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,710
That's Snart's jacket.

410
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,210
I... thought it would help
me get into character.

411
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,840
- I'm Colonel Cold.
- The hell you are.

412
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,810
You're not gonna give yourself a promotion.

413
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,580
Fine.

414
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,890
What are you doing?

415
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,490
Well, we're on a stake-out.

416
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,360
Brought snacks.

417
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,160
Apple slice?

418
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,060
Guess you're still upset
about the White House.

419
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,500
Look, I can be more careful.
I can be more meticulous,

420
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,830
more like Snart.

421
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,600
I don't want you to be like Snart.

422
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,270
What?

423
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,800
You gave me his gun. You told me I had to

424
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,810
try to fill his shoes.

425
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,010
I was wrong.

426
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,950
You keep reminding me of my...
my dead friend.

427
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,150
It's bringing up... It's bringing up f...

428
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,390
- Feelings?
- Yes.

429
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,760
So just stop and be you.

430
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,620
Well, that's a little difficult,

431
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,600
considering I lost my suit,
my company, my powers.

432
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Is this what an existential
crisis feels like?

433
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,630
Shut up. Just... shut up.

434
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,770
♪ Oh, I, I just died in
your arms tonight ♪

435
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,910
I hate the '80s! [smash]

436
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,810
Is there any sign of
who Darhk's meeting with?

437
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,110
Not yet!

438
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,880
Clandestine meeting in a D.C. park.

439
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,950
It feels like the beginning
of a John le Carré spy novel.

440
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,650
I'm more of an Ian Fleming guy.

441
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,420
Mm, more explosions, less clothing.

442
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,460
What if Darhk is
meeting with Rex's killer?

443
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,760
Then we don't let either of them leave.

444
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,160
We've got movement.

445
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,060
A man just entered the park.

446
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,670
Ray, we need audio.

447
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,000
Yep, way ahead of you, Cap.

448
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,770
Thankfully, there was
a Tech Village nearby.

449
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,670
You wouldn't believe what
you can hack together

450
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,070
with a few household items.

451
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,740
Dobriy Vecher, Mr. Darhk.

452
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,550
Sounds like he's meeting with a member of

453
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,450
the Soviet delegation, not Rex's killer.

454
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,820
The package is procured.

455
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,820
Excellent news, Boris.

456
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,220
That is your name, isn't it?
Boris? Or is it Igor?

457
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,030
I find it's always one or the
other with you KGB agents.

458
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,360
Anywho, once the treaty is signed,

459
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,470
during the State Dinner,
you'll deliver the package.

460
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,840
And you will uphold
your half of the bargain?

461
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,340
As agreed.

462
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,540
But first, a toast.

463
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,210
To peace between our two nations.

464
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,410
Darhk was never interested
in the nuclear treaty.

465
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,320
He's working a side deal with the KGB.

466
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
Uh-oh. Mayday!

467
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,220
My... My name is Martin Stein.
You must have heard of me.

468
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,390
You may have heard of me.

469
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,560
Marty, younger you just entered the park.

470
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,400
What? But that... that's impossible.

471
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,600
Today is December 7th,
Clarissa's birthday.

472
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,500
I distinctly remember we
had a dinner reservation

473
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,740
for this evening which
took me months to procure.

474
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,240
Well, you must have blown her off.

475
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,540
- This ought to be good.
- Should we stop him?

476
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,520
Stop what? What am I doing?

477
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,580
Mr. Darhk, uh, allow
me to introduce myself.

478
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,120
My name is Martin Stein.
You may have heard of me.

479
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,550
I'm on the negotiating team
and was recently nominated

480
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,790
for my sixth Carlin Award in physics.

481
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,860
Congratulations.

482
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,260
Thank you. [laughs]

483
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,620
Did you follow me here?

484
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,830
I did. [laughs]

485
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,000
You see, I'm... I'm working on a...
a transmutation project that

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,070
is vital to national security.

487
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,170
I was hoping you might pass the
proposal on to the President.

488
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,740
Excuse me, I can't help
but notice you're wearing

489
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,740
a Komandirskie watch, typically supplied to

490
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,250
the Soviet Ministry of Defense.

491
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,380
Meeting with a Soviet outside

492
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,580
of the official negotiation schedule?

493
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,120
That is highly irregular.

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay. [laughs]

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,940
Clearly, uh, there's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

498
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,570
I'll just leave and pretend these last

499

Ray, what happened?

508
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,800
Darhk just stabbed Marty's younger self.

509
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,130
Where's Darhk?

510
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,600
We lost him.

It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you back.

512

- Where is he?
- He's on his way now.

Guess you figured it out.

517
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,200
How did this happen?

518
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,040
I'm too young to die.
Too brilliant to die.

519
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,740
Will one of you please shut me up?

520
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,640
- Gladly.
- Gideon?

521
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,940
I'm cauterizing the
younger Martin's wound.

522
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,450
I'm afraid it will leave both patients

523
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,110
with a rather nasty scar.

524
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,680
You should've let me punch him.

525
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,920
This is about time travel, isn't it?

526
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,290
That's why Special Advisor
Darhk stabbed me.

527
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,060
He wouldn't have stabbed you
if you had been having dinner

528
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,120
with Clarissa at L'Auberge
as previously planned.

529
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,060
Good God, Clarissa.

530
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,730
She's waiting for me at the hotel.

531
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,960
How could you have left
her alone on her birthday?

532
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,370
She ordered room service.

533
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,100
You are a careless, self-centered idiot.

534
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,600
Gray, Gray, look, I'll go to the hotel,

535
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,840
and I'll tell Clarissa that
her husband's working late.

536
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,310
Okay? Just relax.

537
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,450
Oh, oh, Martin, what on
Earth were you thinking?

538
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,720
Hubba-hubba, who's that?

539
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,490
Professor Stein's wife.

540
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,820
Jax is at her hotel
explaining why she has to

541
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,030
spend her birthday alone.

542
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,130
Wait a minute, if he used everyone's

543
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,960
favorite talking computer to find her...

544
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,470
Gideon, do you have the
location on Damien Darhk?

545
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,300
Unfortunately, I have no intel

546
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,840
on his current whereabouts.

547
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,470
But we know where he's gonna be.

548
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,410
His little side deal with
the Soviets is going down

549
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,940
at the State Dinner tomorrow night.

550
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,380
Which is probably the
most heavily guarded

551
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,720
dinner in history.

552
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,810
I think we know someone
who may be able to help.

553
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,050
Is that so?

554
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,550
One of Amaya's old JSA buddies,

555
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,290
and, by old, I mean old.

556
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,990
He may still have some
government contacts

557
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,490
- we can exploit.
- Absolutely not.

558
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,930
Whatever Darhk is planning
to exchange with the Soviets,

559
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,560
it can't be good.

560
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,260
Well, I'll contact the FBI.

561
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,760
You don't have to worry about it.

562
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,530
Except we do. Darhk's working

563
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,400
with a time traveler. That's way out

564
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,700
of the Bureau's league.

565
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,470
I believe this time traveler killed Rex.

566
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,740
All the more reason to stay
clear of that State Dinner.

567
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,810
You can't remain professional.

568
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,610
Are you kidding me?
She's nothing but professional.

569
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,340
She's all about being professional.

570
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,910
The only reason I could ever see her

571
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,650
not being... Oh, my God, you
and Rex Tyler were together.

572
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,650
- No.
- They were together,

573
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,920
weren't they? This makes total sense.

574
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,220
We weren't together.

575
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
Like I said before, fraternization among

576
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,690
teammates is unprofessional.

577
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,130
Rex and I were going to
leave the JSA after the war,

578
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,130
try and start a new life with each other.

579
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,070
And then he was cut down.

580
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,910
That's why I left the team,
and that's why I wouldn't

581
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,270
talk to you about them.

582
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,110
It's too hard.

583
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,250
And this is why I'm
reluctant to help you.

584
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,280
Because your emotions are
clouding your judgment.

585
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,620
She won't be facing Darhk alone.

586
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,420
We need your help.

587
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,960
I know you feel like I abandoned you,

588
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,960
but, please, don't abandon me.

589
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,630
Hey, how you doing?

590
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,270
I'm all right.

591
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,470
You know, the truth is,

592
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,570
this young man is like a stranger to me.

593
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,810
Every time I encounter
him, I can't imagine

594
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,740
I was ever that person.

595
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
I think anyone would
feel that way about meeting

596
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,550
their younger self.

597
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,450
I don't recognize my current self.

598
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,580
Mick told me I need to be more like me.

599
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,150
And he's right, which is rare.

600
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,950
Hmm, indeed.

601
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,620
The problem is I don't know
what being me means right now.

602
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,290
I don't know if that makes any sense.

603
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,760
Of course it does.

604
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,860
I think everyone struggles
at least on occasion

605
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,130
with who they are and
then what their place is

606
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,600
in the world.

607
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,340
So what's the answer?

608
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,170
I have no idea.

609
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,540
But, I suppose it's just to live.

610
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,050
It's all any of us can really do.

611
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,680
And then, hopefully,
through the act of living

612
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,080
we discover who we truly are

613
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,490
and learn to grow from that.

614
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,430
Amaya got us invites to the State Dinner.

615
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,830
Are you feeling up to it?

616
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,300
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

617
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,770
You feeling up to it?

618
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,330
I think what he means is:
are you gonna create

619
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,670
a diplomatic crisis and
risk unknown damage

620
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,440
to history by killing Damien Darhk?

621
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,770
I know what he means, Ray.

622
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,480
Earlier, you accused me of
not ever caring for anyone,

623
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,450
but you know that's not true.

624
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,690
I care very much about you.

625
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,890
And I'm less concerned about history

626
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,960
than I am about your conscience.

627
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,190
You're no longer an assassin, Sara.

628
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,700
You're our Captain.

629
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,130
Well, let's hope I remember that

630

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,640
Unless...

813
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,510
Unless?

814
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,310
I swiped it off Darhk.

815
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,780
- Shut up.
- [snorts]

816
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,820
Can I hug you? Do we hug?

817
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,050
- Okay, just this once.
- There's gonna be more.

818
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,390
Yeah!

819
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,330
You took a bullet for me.

820
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:53,630
For a fellow member of
the JSA, it was nothing.

821
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,390
Astonishing to be back here again.

822
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,030
A ship that can travel through
time and heal any wound.

823
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,300
- Think of the possibilities...
- Let me remind you,

824
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,090
it's imperative that you
carry on as if you never

825
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,310
so, me or anything else from the future.

826
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,770
That you would pass
up the chance to show me

827
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,970
even the barest glimpse of that future,

828
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,780
catapulting our transmutation
research into the 21st century,

829
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,410
I had no idea I could ever be so selfish.

830
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,550
Interesting, considering that's exactly

831
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,320
how you've been to Clarissa.
She nearly died last night

832
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,520
because of your blind
devotion to your work.

833
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:40,000
You of all people understand
the importance of our research.

834
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,270
I understand the importance
of one thing and one thing only:

835
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,100
After everything
I've accomplished, all...

836
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,810
- All of the awards I've won...
- Did we win the sixth Carlin?

837
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:54,640
The only thing that brings
meaning to my life is Clarissa.

838
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,120
Yes, Martin, our wife, who you spent

839
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,920
the last two days ignoring.

840
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,690
But I love Clarissa.

841
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,830
Then cherish her, Martin,

842
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,590
because I promise you,

843
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,070
she is the only thing you
will care to remember.

844
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,240
And I promise you...

845
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,810
I'll make sure she knows I love her.

846
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,340
I pray that you do.

847
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,980
[beeping]

848
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,080
[sighs]

849
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,790
Are you sure you won't come with us?

850
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,830
Rex's killer is still out there.

851
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,430
We could find him together.

852
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,000
I think last night proved
my fighting days are over.

853
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,100
You were amazing out there.

854
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,840
It felt like old times.

855
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,340
But there's something keeping
you here in 1987, isn't there?

856
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,680
After the JSA disbanded,
I spent a lot of lonely years

857
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,050
until I finally met someone, Amaya.

858
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,390
And he's waiting for me at home.

859
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,920
[laughs]

860
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,390
I have ameliorated Mr. Rice's injuries.

861
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,960
That's incredible. Wow.

862
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,070
A word of advice from an old
man who's lived long enough

863
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,200
to see the world change,
and mostly for the better:

864
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,840
If you are lucky enough
to find love again...

865
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,180
Embrace it.

866
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,850
Are you leaving already?

867
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,050
I was hoping we'd have a beer.

868
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,420
Oh, unlike you, my time is limited,

869
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,090
and I don't need the carbs.

870
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,490
Good-bye, Todd.

871
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,240
Well, I guess I just, uh...

872
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,540
He loved to sing.

873
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,980
Henry, your grandfather.

874
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,250
He had a... A beautiful voice.

875
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,050
During long convoys or stake-outs,

876
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,590
he would serenade the team.

877
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,590
He made it his personal mission
to get me to sing along,

878
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,300
but he never succeeded.

879
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,000
But when the chips were down

880
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,930
and all hope seemed lost,

881
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,170
we could always count on
Henry to lift our spirits.

882
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,640
That's the kind of man
your grandfather was.

883
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,850
[bottles clink]

884
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,080
Then take me back there now.

885
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,510
I will get your item back for you.

886
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,550
The Legends have left 1987.

887
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,190
The item is beyond your reach.

888
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,620
That blonde woman...
She's a time traveler like you.

889
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,220
She knows what happens
to me in the future.

890
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,690
- I'm sure she does.
- Then take me with you.

891
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,160
I need to change my destiny.

892
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,930
Tell you what, why don't we work together

893
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,130
to change both of our destinies?

894
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,270
Step inside.

895
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,550
Whoa.

896
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,350
[electric crackling]

897
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,290
[whirring]

898
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,660
[electric crackling]

899
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,570
