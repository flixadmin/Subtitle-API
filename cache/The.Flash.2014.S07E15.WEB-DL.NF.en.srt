I really thought that was it.

811
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,980
But somehow,

812
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,564
I was okay with it.

813
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,526
Can I tell you why?

814
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,448
It was because
you were with me.

815
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,618
And somehow,

816
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,372
knowing that you would be
the last face that I would see

817
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,208
or the last voice

818
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,085
that I'd hear...

819
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,253
just made everything okay.

820
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,007
Everything.

821
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,635
- I didn't think
we were gonna make it, either.

822
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,805
But we did.

823
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,769
What are you
thinking about now, Mark?

824
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,940
- You, Snowflake.

825
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,532
[bang, clatter]

826
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,163
- What the hell was that?

827
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,054
Sucrose and potassium chlorate
my ass.

828
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,305
Mark!

829
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,616
- Barry?
- Mm.

830
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,700
- Stop worrying.

831
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,035
You're gonna be a great dad.

832
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,745
- [chuckles]
- We all know it.

833
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,039
- Thanks, Cecile.

834
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,791
I just...

835
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,960
wish Iris was feeling better
and could be here.

836
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,544
- I know, I know.

837
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,172
But you're gonna call her
as soon as we're done.

838
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,298
- Yeah.

839
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,551
- Okay, what is it?

840
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,678
- Oh, I was just thinking.
I'm...

841
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,141
I hope our child has

842
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,017
Iris's heart.

843
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,435
And her fearlessness.

844
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,562
- Oh, she will.

845
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,784
- It's...it's negative.

846
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,039
I don't...

847
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,667
I...

848
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,295
I mean, my dream.

849
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,922
Nora said everything
was gonna work out.

850
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,091
- It will, honey.

851
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,177
I know it will.
- How?

852
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:10,723
If...if this isn't
the future for me and Iris...

853
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,270
What is?

854
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,283
[crickets chirping]

855
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,080
- Creyke hasn't shown up
all day.

856
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,666
Maybe he moved on?

857
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,668
- No, he'll be here.

858
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,253
I can feel it.

859
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,048
It's strange,

860
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,218
being so close to almost
closing this case.

861
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,889
- Are you worried about
arresting an old friend?

862
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,185
- After we joined the service,

863
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,895
I went into intelligence.

864
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,439
Adam ended up
in special forces.

865
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,900
Turns out he had a knack
for killing.

866
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,318
- Oh.

867
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,486
- One the army used
to great effect.

868
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,158
Something changed in him, West.

869
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,036
And I didn't see it.

870
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,664
- And since you two grew up
so much alike...

871
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,169
Now you're worried that
whatever broke him

872
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,712
might break you too?

873
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,048
- All our lives,
we had each other's backs.

874
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,427
'Till he stabbed me in mine.

875
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,555
Left me for dead.

876
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,646
What could change a person
enough to do that?

877
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,573
- What the hell is that?

878
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,825
- Get out of the car!
