Darhk, Merlyn and the Speedster.

82

Well, I carbon-dated the amulet
that Sara took from Darhk in 1987.

88
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,868
Before she gave it back
to the Legion of Doom, I'm guessing.

89
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:50,337
Yeah, and Gideon puts the amulet's date
of origin around 30 A.D.

90
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,131
High concentrations
of manganese, copper and zinc.

91
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,712
Which would make bronze.

92
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,348
Correct. Now, Roman centurions
put bronze in all their metalwork.

93
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,599
Circa 30 A.D.

I also sketched the two amulets
the best I could from memory,

Longinus is the name generally

who pierced the side of Christ
during the Crucifixion.

103

Now, that blood
allegedly got on the Medallion,

107
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,432
and empowered it and the Spear
with magical powers.

108
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,521
Well, why does the Legion of Doom
want the Medallion?

- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,857
Well, according to legend,
the Medallion calls for the Spear,

112
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,650
and basically takes you right to it.

113
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,617
The Spear is also known as
the Holy Lance or the Spear of Destiny.

116

Okay, so the Legion wanted the Medallion
so they could get the Spear.

117
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,088
But what do they want with the Spear?

118
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,471
Well, the Spear allegedly
has the power to rewrite reality.

119

this one is frustratingly unspecific.

Actually, like most magical artifacts,
its ways are nuanced.

137

00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,918
Weren't Darhk and Merlyn former L.O.A.?

161
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,171
He must be getting closer
to the Holy Lance.

162
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,672
I'm leaning towards Spear of Destiny.

163
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,124
I prefer Holy Lance.

164
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,291
Can't imagine why.

AMAYA: Is the Professor all right?

169
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,595
Uh, depends on
what you mean by "all right."

170
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,183
He's helping Mick with something.

171
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,064
I don't know.
He's been kinda quiet about it.

172
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,105
I hope he figures it out soon,
'cause if the Legion of Doom is here...

173
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,815
Really like how that name's catching on.

174
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,446
We're gonna need Mick and Firestorm.

175
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,107
Let's figure out what's going on first.

176
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,200
Look, all I know is Gideon said,

177
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,361
the motorcycles Darhk
and Merlyn stole are here.

178
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,328
What? We're just supposed to walk around
until we see a sign that says, "This Way"?

179
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,950
Good idea.

180
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,124
Subjugating the world to your rule
isn't saving it.

181
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,126
You would create a wasteland,
and call it peace.

182
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,962
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

183
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,297
I knew him well.

184
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,468
I lived long enough to watch

Cut! Just stop.

186
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,179
- Cut, please.
- MAN: <i>All right. Cut.</i>

187
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,482
And everyone take five.

188
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,988
I just need to think.

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,367
George.

190
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,821
What do I do?

191
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,409
It wasn't that bad...

192
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,656
You saw him.

193
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,748
I just can't seem to get Peter
to bring any menace to the part.

194
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,625
I may need to recast.

195
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,335
No, no, no.
You don't have time to recast, okay?

Your thesis film is due
in less than a month.

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,672
I know, I know, but...

198
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,178
Look, a film is only as good
as its villain.

199
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,216
And I have an antagonist
who's as threatening as a...

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Weiner dog.

201

Rip Hunter?

202
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,854
No, I'm the director,
Rip's being played by Adam Glassman.

203
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,356
He's probably at craft services.

204
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,359
Nice to see your reputation
for dry humor is well-earned.

- I can't leave my film in there!

214

00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,065
Get Rip out of here.

00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,573
- Hey, come on. We got to go.
- Get away from me.

Well, that went apocalyptically awful.

229
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,767
I've got Nate and Amaya researching
where the police took Rip.

230
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,435
We'll spring him, and then...

231
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,696
We'll find out what the hell is
going on with him?

232

Dude tried to bludgeon me
with this non-lethal weapon.

233
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,943
Look, we don't know how long
he was in 1967.

234
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,784
He could be suffering from time drift,
which is why he doesn't remember us.

235
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,789
The question is, how?

236
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,127
Well, he could have time-scattered himself
like he did with us.

237
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,164
No. He sent us his final message
after scattering us.

238
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,207
He wouldn't have been able
to use it for a second time.

239
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,297
Well, he got here somehow,
and so did Darhk and Merlyn.

- I'm not calling them that.
- Okay.

242
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,475
If they came to 1967 looking for Rip,
that means...

243
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,602
The Medallion must have led them here.

Rip has the Spear of Destiny.

And ever since,
I've had a fear of giant toads.

Mr. Rory, while I appreciate
the thoroughness of your insights,

248
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,653
perhaps we could focus
on the issue at hand.

00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,490

You know, I think I've heard
enough on that subject.

252
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,713
Now, when did you
first encounter the apparition?

253
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,260
The ghost of Mr. Snart.
When did he first appear?

254
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,880
Back in Chicago.

255
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,840
Can you remember anything specific?

256
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,008
Something that might have
triggered the vision?

257
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,512
He said something about
setting me straight.

258
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,351
- Why do you think he'd say that?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,022
Maybe he's, um...

263
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,907
That's astonishing. How?

264
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,694
We don't know. But Damien Darhk
and Malcolm Merlyn are after him,

00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,908
which means you two

It's imperative that he be released
into my custody immediately.

He suffers from delusions
of being pursued by futuristic spacemen.

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,887
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>What is it?</i>

314
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,680
(SIGHS)

315
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,397
Can I help you?

316
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,854
Hey.

317
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,856
(GRUNTS)

318
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,117
DR. HEYWOOD: (OVER COMMS)
<i>Sara, you've got incoming.</i>

319
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,703
<i>Darhk and Merlyn
just entered the precinct.</i>

320
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,128
SARA: <i>Yeah. I see him.</i>

321
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,215
- They're blocking our escape.
- There must be another way out.

322
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,967
Ray, how well can you fly the <i>Waverider?</i>

323
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,473
RAY: <i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

324
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,310
- Wait, you know how to fly the ship?
- Sure do.

325
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,018
I just have to channel my inner Han Solo.

326
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,103
- Gideon does most of the work.
- She does?

327
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,517
GIDEON: <i>I do.</i>

328
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,772
Where to, Cap?

329
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,617
All right. We're here.

330
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,449
Get to the cargo bay.

331
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,913
Ray, do not crash my ship.
You break it, you buy it.

332
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,178
- Get away from me!
- Captain Hunter, you must listen to us.

333
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,763
Why do you keep calling me that?

334
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,724
- Look, Rip...
- Is this some kind of joke?

335
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,389
Rip, just calm down, okay?
We need you to remember.

336
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,401
Your name is Rip Hunter.
You are a Time Master.

337
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,232
You fly the Waverider. It's a time ship.

338
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,153
Rip! Rip, just wait.

339
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,368
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

340
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,623
This cannot be happening.

341
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,625
- Am I dreaming?
- Rip?

342
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:23,301
Oh, God! Did I drop some really bad acid?

343
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,794
Rip, be careful.

344
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,180
Why? I'm hallucinating.

345
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:33,311
There's no such thing as Rip Hunter,
and there's no such thing as a time ship.

346
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,978
There's a...

347
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,238
Get to the ship. Go!

348
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,655
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Guys, come on. Quick.

349
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,822
Come on!

350
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,463
SARA: <i>Well, Gideon?</i>

351
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,514
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid the news isn't good,
Captain.</i>

352
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,765
<i>A deep scan reveals that.</i>

353
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,178
<i>Captain Hunter's neural architecture
has been completely restructured.</i>

354
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,847
<i>His limbic system reprogrammed
with a new identity.</i>

355
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,937
So it isn't time drift.

356
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,524
Rip didn't forget who he was. He...

357
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,447
- Changed.
- RAY: <i>Reprogrammed?</i>

358
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,068
The technology to alter the brain
at that level doesn't even exist.

359
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,698
Unless Rip's brain was somehow altered
by impulses from the...

360
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,746
- From the...
- From the ship's time drive?

361
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,206
Yeah.

362
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,214
You're talking temporal electrocution
as a method of time travel.

363
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,921
- It's practically suicidal.
- Does that track?

364
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,842
I'm not sure. Excuse me.

365
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,715
What's his problem?

366
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,633
I don't know.

367
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,519
GIDEON: <i>Captain Hunter must have
shut down my systems because he knew</i>

368
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,397
<i>I would never permit him to
make physical contact with the time drive.</i>

369
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,725
For good reason,
he could have ended up anywhere,

370
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,235
and in any period in time.

371
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,522
<i>But before he deactivated me,
he recovered something from his parlor.</i>

372
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,532
<i>A piece of wood
approximately .6 meters long.</i>

373
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,734
A piece of wood?

374
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,903
The Spear of Destiny?

375
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,828
Could be. I'm gonna go tell the others.

376
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,086
I got an idea.

377
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,583
So this would be
a new milestone for you then.

378
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,335
What's your idea?

379
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,008
Why don't we use that thing
to see what's up with my brain?

380
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,183
I doubt you'd find the results
you're hoping for.

381
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,515
These tests are meant to find
neurological changes,

382
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,430
while my theory is that

383
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,645
your visions are the result of emotion.

384
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,939
You're saying I'm crazy?

385
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,946
I'm saying you're feeling something.

386
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,905
And in the wake of your partner's demise,
that's perfectly normal.

387
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,697
I don't do feelings.
Run a test. Fix my brain.

388
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,790
Hey, what's up?

389
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,951
Sara asked us to find
any physical descriptions

390
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,870
of the Spear that might help us find it.

391
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,539
She thinks Rip had it with him
when he traveled to 1967.

392
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,129
And she also wanted you to work on

393
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,092
figuring out, um, a way
to reverse the effects on Rip

394
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,967
since he came in contact with the...

395
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,139
Time drive.

396
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,145
GIDEON: <i>I've brought up the time drive
schematics for you, Dr. Palmer.</i>

397
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,226
(LAUGHS) What? How do you expect me
to understand any of that?

398
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,645
Uh, maybe using one of your four PhDs?

399
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,859
I don't have four...

400
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,319
What's wrong?

401
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,660
It's like I should have memories
that aren't there,

402
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,823
and I should understand what this is,
but I don't.

403
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,492
Yeah, I feel it, too.
It's happening right now.

404
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,411
I'm reading this book
about Centurion Longinus

405
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,831
and it's just a bunch of words.

406
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,918
How long have the two of you
been feeling like this?

407
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,386
- Since, uh...
- RAY: <i>Since, uh...</i>

408
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,756
- Film set.
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Film set.</i>

409
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,682
Mr. Hunter's film.

410
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,803
Sara had Jax go and recover
what he could find.

411
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,138
"Glucas."

412
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,683
Wait. Isn't that what you pretend
you're allergic to, Ray?

413
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,274
What? First of all, my gluten allergy
is very real and challenging.

414
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:15,029
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

415
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,612
<i>Wait. George Lucas.
How do I know that name?</i>

416
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,036
Gideon, pull up George Lucas
on the historical record.

417
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,124
GIDEON: <i>George Lucas, born in Modesto,
California, on May 14th, 1944.</i>

418
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,207
<i>Named Modesto Hartman's
"insurance Salesman of the Year"</i>

419
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,091
<i>in 1977, 1980, and 1983.</i>

420
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,877
Three years. Hmm.

421
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,839
- That doesn't seem right.
- No.

422
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,719
Gideon, is there a version of history

423
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,980
where Mr. Lucas
did something else with his life?

424
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,229
(EXHALES) Apparently, this Mr. Lucas
is an Aberration.

425
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,563
He's not the Aberration.

426
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,353
The Legion of Doom scaring him
is the Aberration.

427
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,397
An Aberration
that directly affects our lives!

428
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,658
Okay! Calm down. Take it back.

429
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,070
Gideon thinks that the Legion's attack
on Mr. Hunter's film set

430
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,615
caused this George Lucas guy
to quit moviemaking.

431
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,250
As a result, he never made some movie
about space battles,

432
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,911
or another one about an
improbably handsome archeologist.

433
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,705
And we care about this because?

434
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,713
GIDEON: <i>In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees </i>Star Wars <i>as a child</i>

435
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,593
<i>and is inspired to become an inventor.</i>

436
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,255
<i>Likewise, Dr. Heywood
chooses to be a historian</i>

437
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,593
<i>after seeing</i> Indiana Jones

438
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,596
<i>instead of becoming a yoga instructor.</i>

439
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,851
Aw, man!

440
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,182
Wait. So, you're telling me

441
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,268
that because some film geek
drops out of school,

442
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,434
my inventor and my historian
are now, essentially, useless?

443
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,685
- Yes.
- Hey.

444
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,899
- I'm just saying.
- I'm just saying.

445
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,563
GIDEON:
<i>If the Aberration is not corrected, yes.</i>

446
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,857
We need to fix this now.

447
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,451
GIDEON:
<i>I fear you may already be too late.</i>

448
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,455
<i>As of today, George Lucas
is no longer enrolled in film school.</i>

449
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,371
(SIGHS)

450
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,899
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>There he is.</i>

451
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,736
George Lucas, the man who inspires
both of our careers.

452
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,652
- Supposedly.
- Well, let's go inspire him.

453
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,824
- Guys, maybe I should do the...
- Hey, George!

454
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,451
You remember us? I had metallic skin.

455
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,329
- No! No! No, no!
- Hey. George Lucas, wait.

456
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Look, time takes time to harden.

457
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,659
Sooner or later,
we're going to lose our superpowers

458
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,418
the same way we're losing our memories.

459
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,579
If you don't make the movies
that you make,

460
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,214
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

461
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,670
And I don't become
an incredibly handsome historian.

462
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:42,180
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?
I'm still in film school.

463
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,265
- Or I was.
- RAY: <i>That's the point.</i>

464
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,185
If you don't go back to school,
you'll screw up both of our lives.

465
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,937
We don't live up to our full potential.

466
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,813
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon!

467
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,440
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>And I don't want
to be a yoga instructor.</i>

468
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,853
Okay, guys, like I said,
why don't I talk to our Time Aberration?

469
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,111
- Yeah, but...
- Shh.

470
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,113
Stay in school.

471
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,032
I'm sorry about my friends,
they're just...

472
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,118
Completely insane?

473
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,368
Yeah, but what they say is true.

474
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:16,289
(LAUGHS) Okay, what?
That you guys are from the future?

475
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,880
That you've somehow seen a bunch of movies
that I haven't even made yet?

476
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,545
Well, actually I'm from the past,
but that's beside the point.

477
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,011
Look, George, I don't care about movies,

478
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,300
but guys like them,

479
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,887
they do.

480
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,890
<i>So, before you get in that oar
and drive back to Modesto,</i>

481
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,808
just think about them, okay?

482
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,821
Them and all the millions of other people
that your stories will someday inspire.

483
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,237
<i>The future of the entire world
is at stake.</i>

484
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,244
And you're our only hope.

485
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,081
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

486
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,337
They're charming.

487
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,922
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

488
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,256
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Something unusual. Some sort of receiver.</i>

489
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,386
Judging from its design,

490
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,681
one sensitive
to gravitation wave transmissions.

491
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,551
You're telling me
I have an antenna in my head.

492
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,013
- Well, the good news is you're not crazy.
- RORY: <i>Oh, really?</i>

493
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,062
So, seeing and talking to Snart is real.

494
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,643
Well, in a sense, yes.

495
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,937
Your former partner was killed

496
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,277
when the Oculus exploded
in a blast of temporal energy.

497
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,285
Now, if Mr. Snart
was able to bond with that blast,

498
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,952
the version of him you're now seeing
could be, um...

499
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,536
How will I put this?

500
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,542
Like a time-ghost?

501
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,793
Precisely!

502
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,078
But what I want to know is,

503
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:43,467
how did someone manage to put a device
inside your brain without you knowing it?

504
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,969
- MAN: <i>You're Chronos.</i>
- (GRUNTS)

505
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,384
The Time Masters.

506
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,977
They did some sick things to me
when I was Chronos.

507
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,642
I'm sorry, I forgot.

508
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,478
So, what you're saying is,
Snart's stuck out there,

509
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,612
blasted into a billion pieces
floating around in time and space.

510
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,492
A rather simplistic way of looking at it,
but, yes.

511
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,992
You're an idiot.

512
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,621
- Excuse me?
- It didn't have to end like this.

513
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,666
Mr. Snart, is he here?

514
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,412
Why am I here? Why are you here?

515
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,088
You are dead.

516
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,087
What's he saying?

517
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,508
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

518
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,922
(GRUNTING)

519
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,800
Doc. Doc.

520
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,431
You gotta get this thing out of my head.

521
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,063
As I explained, I'm not a medical doctor.

522
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,348
(GROWLS SOFTLY)

523
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,435
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

524
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,104
- That can work?
- In theory, yes.

525
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,903
(EXHALES)

526
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,363
Huh.

527
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,201
Groovy office.

528
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,586
Used to be yours.

529
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,634
Come on. None of this is bringing back
any memories for you?

530
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,013
Listen, lady. I wish that I could be
the guy that you want me to be.

531
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,096
The "Rip." But I am not.

532
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,219
(CLEARS THROAT)

533
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,893
I take it you two were pretty tight?

534
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,525
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

535
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,685
You.

536
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,737
You saved my life.

537
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,402
I was lost. You came, you recruited me.
You gave me purpose.

538
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,449
It sounds like Sandra.

539
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,410
She's the hero of my movie.

540
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,326
- That's weird...
- What? A female hero?

541
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,915
Get with the times, lady.

542
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,247
Yo, we're all in his movie.

543
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,919
I mean, it's different versions of us,
but this is definitely the team.

544
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,799
Like on page 89, my character, Max,
he saves...

545
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,967
Hold on.
You're telling me that this burnout

546
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,433
used repressed memories
to write a screenplay?

547
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,099
That's not all.
He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.

548
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,691
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped off the <i>Waverider.</i>

549
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,948
I don't know what you're talking about.

550
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,234
- Yes, you do.
- Come on, now.

551
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,446
What, I just made it all up.
The spear is the McGuffin.

552
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,738
- The what?
- The what?

553
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,748
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

554
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:20,908
Well, where is it?

555
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,329
In the movie, it's in pieces.
Rip just has a fragment of it.

556
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,795
What inspired you to write it that way?

557
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,296
I don't know.

558
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,797
I just had this old piece of wood.
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

559
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,343
- Where is it?
- Uh, I gave it to my prop master. George.

560
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,385
Oh.

561
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,809
Great.

562
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,808
George Lucas has the Spear of Destiny.

563
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,480
Glad you changed your mind, George Lucas.

564
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,157
Going back to film school,
definitely the right call.

565
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,609
We agree.

566
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,611
(GRUNTS)

567
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,166
MALCOLM: Neat trinket.

568
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,548
One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?

569
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,839
Ah, Mr. Lucas,

570
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,176
you have something that we have
traveled a very long way to find.

571
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,842
A piece of the Spear of Destiny.

572
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,848
(YELLS) Where is it?

573
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,853
Lady and gentlemen,
if you don't mind, hands up.

574
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,902
And if you do mind,
we'd be happy to kill you.

575
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,076
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

576
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,321
What?

577
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,864
It's not here. My suit's not here.

578
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,199
I can't steel up.

579
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,744
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Put 'em up.

580
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,127
- He was talking, I didn't...
- Hands up.

581
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,381
- Shut up.
- They're up.

582
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,921
Thank God. I don't think it's here.

583
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,212
All right, Specky Four-eyes,
I'm starting to lose my patience with you.

584
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,380
Where is the Spear?

585
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,548
What spear?

586
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,139
We had a little chat
with the members of your film crew.

587
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,680
And they all claimed the
"Spear of Destiny" was a prop,

588
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,019
and that you, Mr. Lucas, were its master.

589
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,228
Yeah, but the movie was done.

590
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,734
I tossed all the props
down the garbage chute.

591
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,021
- They were just trash.
- But, but, but, but... Shh!

592
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,574
I've one question for you, Mr. Lucas.

593
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,203
And your life depends on
answering me honestly.

594
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,040
Where is the city dump?

595
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,378
Gideon, set us down
as close to their location as you can get.

596
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,754
GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain Lance.</i>

597
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,381
And while you're at it, find Mick and...

598
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,962
Grey?

599
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,966
SARA: <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

600
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,756
Brain surgery. What does it look like?

601
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,426
DARHK: We down there somewhere.

602
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,937
Good, because you'll never find it.

603
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,221
You're right.

604
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,059
You're going to.

605
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,062
(ALL GRUNT)

606
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,779
I could be in Modesto by now.

607
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,993
Shut up and dig, George Lucas.

608
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,334
What kind of superheroes
are you guys, anyway? Huh?

609
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,710
I mean, sure they have laser guns,

610
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,496
but aren't you guys
supposed to have superpowers?

611
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,130
Yeah, well, we had superpowers.

612
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,633
But because you don't make Star Wars,
I don't become a scientist,

613
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,918
I don't make the Atom suit.

614
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,678
Or the serum that turns me into steel.

615
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,510
I can't believe we're all going to die
because of a stupid movie.

616
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,549
Perhaps they need a little incentive.

617
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
DARHK: Oh.

618
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,519
Agreed.

00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- RAY: Oh, no.

621
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,517
What was that?

622
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,440
<i>Don't just stand there,
try and brace it with something.</i>

623
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,649
Oh, no.

624
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,491
Oh, no.

625
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,322
(ALL GRUNTING)

626
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,997
- Guys, I found it.
- Don't show 'em.

627
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,837
What? We're in a trash compactor.
We're going to die.

628
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,003
No, Ray's right. If we give them what
they want, they're gonna kill us anyway.

629
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,295
Okay, well, then what do we do?

630
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,466
They're going too slow.
Shoot one of them to move things along.

631
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,600
- Which one?
- Dealer's choice.

632
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,019
What was that?

633
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,530
(GRUNTING)

634
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,556
This rescue mission
is not going very well, is it?

635
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,717
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid not, Captain.</i>

636
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,599
Would you stop calling me that, please?

637
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,061
I'm not a captain, I'm just a regular guy.

638
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,395
<i>So was Captain Hunter.</i>

639
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,775
<i>He had no superpowers,</i>

640
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,108
<i>unless you count his courage,
intellect, and honor.</i>

641
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:05,492
Well, what would he do, huh?
Your captain, if he were here?

642
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,664
You guys, we have to give it to them.
There's no other way.

643
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,337
There is. You have to become a filmmaker,
you have to make movies.

644
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,749
And you, George Lucas,
have to believe that.

645
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,588
- What?
- You have to make your movies,

646
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,423
so that we can become
who we're supposed to become.

647
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,711
So we can save you.

648
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,255
Your movies go on to change the world.

649
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,090
All you have to do is believe in yourself.

650
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,929
You have to believe
you are gonna make amazing movies.

651
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,101
You have to believe it,
like there's no tomorrow.

652
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,267
Say it, George, say it out loud.

653
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,773
George Lucas, what do you really want?

654
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,524
What I really want?

655
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,981
What I really want?

656
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,610
What I really want is to direct.

657
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,403
Ah!

658
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,454
(GRUNTING)

659
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,798
Whoa!

660
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,527
(SIGHS)

661
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,001
- About time you showed.
- Where were you?

662
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,628
Always busy, gentlemen,
and yet never late.

663
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,382
So, who do we kill first?

664
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,668
That would be me.

665
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
EOBARD: <i>Captain Rip Hunter.</i>

666
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,009
<i>It's been ages.</i>

667
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,678
I was beginning to think you were dead.

668
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,392
On the contrary,

669
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:03,811
for the first time in recent memory,
I am finally, truly, alive.

670
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:06,901
(GUN CLICKS)

671
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,697
Oh, crap.

672
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,742
Hey, does this thing work?

673
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,907
(LAUGHING)

674
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,798
Screw it. Gideon, fire!

675
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,713
Fire everything!

676
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,430
Go!

677
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,067
- Hey, come on.
- Rip!

678
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,944
- Rip!
- Hey, Sara.

679
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,110
- Rip!
- We gotta go, he's gone.

680
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,066
- Gideon...
- Rip!

681
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,296
(EXHALES)

682
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,469
We couldn't have got him.

683
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,805
You know that, right?

684
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,057
Yeah.

685
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,350
Look, Sara,
you can't beat yourself up about this.

686
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,560
It's my responsibility, as captain,

687
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,899
to make sure that everyone
gets back on this ship.

688
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,734
<i>Everyone.</i>

689
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,612
And I failed.

690
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,779
You call getting a piece
of the Spear of Destiny

691
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,948
and the Medallion a failure?

692
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,251
The Legion have nothing.

693
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,291
They have Rip.

694
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,916
We lost him, Jax. Again.

695
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,668
But they won't have him for long.

696
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,464
If I know one thing about you,
it's that you don't give up.

697
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,767
When you really want something,
you are unstoppable,

698
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,394
<i>and God help anybody
that tries to get in your</i> way.

699
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,891
We are gonna find him
and we're gonna bring him home.

700
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,106
Is that a promise?

701
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,236
That's a prophecy.

702
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,916
How are you feeling? Have you seen
our mutual friend around lately?

703
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,998
No, that's because you took the chip out.

704
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,162
Well, actually...

705
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,757
- You did take the chip out?
- Yes, I did.

706
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,384
But after further inspection,

707
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,968
I discovered that the device
hasn't functioned in months.

708
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,680
It seems you've taken one too many
blows to the head.

709
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,719
So I am going crazy.

710
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,647
- I'm seeing a ghost.
- There is no ghost.

711
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,693
Leonard Snart truly is no more.

712
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,189
Then why do I keep hearing his voice?

713
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,109
That voice inside your head is your own.

714
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:03,532
If Leonard Snart is second-guessing
your moral obligation to this team...

715
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,245
But that's what I feel.

716
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,499
We all hear contradictory voices
inside our heads, Mr. Rory,

717
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,378
creating what is known in psychology
as cognitive dissonance.

718
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,338
My brain hurts.

719
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,428
Well, I'm sure it does.

720
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,642
The complexities of human emotion
can, at times, be mindboggling.

721
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,602
What's this?

722
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,812
I thought you got your smarts back.
It's movie night.

723
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,195
Gideon checked the timeline.

724
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,108
It seems all of George's movies
are now part of history again.

725
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,653
Huh. I've almost forgotten
how to perform a median sternotomy.

726
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,996
Well, I guess, I'll just go back to being
a billionaire inventor with four PhDs.

727
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,750
So, what are we gonna watch first?

728
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,913
I mean, after we watch Raiders,
clearly his best film.

729
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,836
Which he never would've made
if he hadn't made Star Wars first.

730
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,842
Oh, wait, this one sounds cute,
it's called <i>Howard the Duck?</i>

731
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,002
- No.
- No.

732
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,212
Okay.

733
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,381
Maybe movie night
wasn't such a good idea.

734
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,095
Maybe you're right.

735
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,137
After all, we did just lose Rip.

736
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,772
I know Nate and I
never really got to know Rip,

737
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,434
but we know how much
he means to the rest of you.

738
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,601
Yeah.

739
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,896
GIDEON: <i>Might I offer my opinion?</i>
RAY: Fire away.

740
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,317
<i>I believe Captain Hunter would want you
to enjoy yourselves tonight.</i>

741
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,986
All right then, dim the lights.

742
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,951
Gideon, pick the movie.

743
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,957
We'll watch Raiders after.

744
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,123
- Then, <i>Empire.</i>
- Then, <i>Last Crusade.</i>

745
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,123
Get comfy. It's gonna be a long night.

746
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,418
Uh...

747
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,596
Hello?

748
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,305
Hello?

749
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,350
Is anybody there?

750
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,438
Hey, man.

751
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,153
Welcome, Captain Hunter.

752
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,772
You know I was bluffing, right?

753
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,864
I am not actually Rip Hunter.

754
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,029
My name is Phil.

755
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,913
I'm a full-time film student,
and part-time recreational drug user.

756
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,077
Seriously regretting the latter.

757
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,372
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

758
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,209
I know that you are one of the
protectors of the Spear of Destiny.

759
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,221
And I know that you know
where the other pieces are hidden.

760
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:28,510
(STUTTERS) I don't know anything! I swear.

761
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,346
<i>I am not Rip Hunter!</i>

762
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,479
I am nobody!

763
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,486
I can't believe this is happening to me.

764
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,369
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

765
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,160
Oh, I'm not going to torture you,
Mr. Hunter.

766
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,704
<i>No.</i>

767
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,249
They are.

768
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,051
No.

769
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,676
No, please, please. Please,
please, please, let me go.

770
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,058
Let me go!
