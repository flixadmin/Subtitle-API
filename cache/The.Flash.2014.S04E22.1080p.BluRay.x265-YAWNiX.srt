00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,209
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,957
It's the city. They're responding
to my article.

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,255
This guy says that he saw DeVoe
at Fifth and Long two days ago.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,331
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,541
This means DeVoe can't
hide from us anymore.

6
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,342
<i>The injection of dark matter
from the thinking cap</i>

7
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,635
which overwhelmed my synapses.

8
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,805
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

9
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,009
<i>DeVoe plans to position each
of his five satellites around the globe.</i>

10
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,468
And when the satellites link up...

11
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,805
He'll use that network to emit
a series of dark matter bursts.

12
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,765
That will reboot the prefrontal cortex

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,600
of every man, woman and child
on this Earth.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,981
We know we need a tech-free projectile

15
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,445
to stop DeVoe's satellites.

16
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,898
We've been looking for an object

17
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,108
when what we really need is a person.

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,318
Amunet.

19
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,575
It will deliver
one savage concussive blow.

20
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,330
But you only get one shot.

21
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,624
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,871
Now, you want to rule it.

23
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,203
I am leaving you, Clifford.

24
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,640
Agent Diggle, good to see you, sir.

25
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,895
- We have the specimen ready...
- The specimen?

26
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,062
That's a man in there
who we are supposed to protect.

27
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,141
Of course, sir.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,649
Our most powerful meta-dampener
is set on the building,

29
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,899
I assure you.

30
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,116
- Elvis Banana.
- Hendrix Spaghetti.

31
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,657
- Eye scan?
- DNA sample, sir.

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,408
Central City branch had some trouble

33
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,581
with the transmogrifier
this time last year.

34
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,785
- You're good to go, sir.
- Good.

35
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,039
Now drop the dampener.

36
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,330
Got caught in a blast.

37
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,881
Slugger's microchipped now.

38
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,629
Dampener scrambles the frequency.

39
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,383
<i>Technical, this is Castellan.</i>

40
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,839
<i>Lower the draw-bridge.</i>

41
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,679
Thank you, gentlemen.

42
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,689
Modern music.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,070
So lacking in the harmonic resources

44
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,948
necessary for expressiveness

45
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,240
or profundity.

46
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,250
The timpani in Handel's orchestra
weighed 140 pounds.

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,003
The exact gravitational force
that I'm now exerting

48
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,500
on your lungs.

49
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,803
Music Appreciation 101.

50
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:28,184
This evening's recital will be
conducted by your beloved professor.

51
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,724
Who's there?

52
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,528
My wife

53
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,068
cared very little for violence.

54
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,273
Stay where you are!

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,650
Me...

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,907
- Not so much.
- Light him up!

57
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,625
Get him!

58
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,143
Get out of my mind!

59
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,851
Move, move, move.

60
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,824
Man down!

61
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,069
Hey!

62
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,161
Come on. Come on.

63
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,924
"DeVoe coming for Borman."

64
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,060
And God said,

65
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,183
"Let there be light."

66
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,407
Okay, we got eyes on Cape Canaveral,
SpaceX and the Xichang Space Center.

67
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,864
And Blackhawk Island.

68
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,037
That's every launchpad
south of the 39th parallel.

69
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,372
Good man.

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,495
Okay, are we sure that DeVoe
is gonna launch

71
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,746
the machine from an airfield?

72
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,249
If he's shooting five satellites
into synchronous orbit,

73
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,625
that's the latitude he needs.

74
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,586
And whether or not he's still
moping around

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,133
about his wife ditching him,
he's gonna resurface.

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,210
He's gonna do it soon.

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,048
When he does,
I whoosh, you whoosh, she bangs.

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,136
If I can get there in time.

79
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,559
I mean, I'm still not fast enough

80
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,056
to make it through
DeVoe's pocket dimension.

81
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,387
That's why we split up.

82
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,771
Yeah, each one of us stakes out
a different launchpad.

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,398
You're serious?
I mean, you've seen DeVoe in action.

84
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,196
Yeah. The guy's a one-man
Legion of Doom,

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,565
so send the Super Friends.

86
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,983
Okay, but we're not at full
super-strength right now.

87
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,569
I mean, Joe's got the baby on the way,

88
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,450
and Caitlin's looking for Killer Frost,

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,530
and Harry's...

90
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,169
This chair came out of nowhere.

91
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,167
So, hey, Allen. West-Allen.

92
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,166
- Ramon.
- Cisco.

93
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,588
Cisco Ramon, guys.

94
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,554
Check this out, okay?

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,849
Somebody has been blogging
about The Thinker.

96
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,972
About DeVoe and the bus metas,
all of it, okay?

97
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,598
And if we find this blogger,
we can stop The Thinker.

98
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,146
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

99
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,394
That's... That's my blog.

100
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,975
Look at the byline.

101
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,062
It's not written by
Iris West-Allen, okay?

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:09,860
It's written by Anonymous
Central City Citizen. Boom.

103
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,910
- Mic drop.
- Hold on to that mic.

104
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:12,987
It's imaginary.

105
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,574
I asked you to proofread this
for me, remember?

106
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,122
You asked me to proofread this when?

107
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,997
This morning. That's when.

108
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,082
When you said, "Harry.

109
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,172
"Can you proofread?
Will you proofread? Will you read..."

110
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,295
It's...

111
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,922
Let's start by finding him a room
with less chairs.

112
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,474
Okay. Good.

113
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,143
- Powder on the floor?
- It happens.

114
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,848
You have 400,000 new views?
That's amazing.

115
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,182
I know, right?

116
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,188
I mean, people have been
writing in from all over,

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,734
sharing their theories
and reporting DeVoe sightings. It's...

118
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,231
- And Marlize sightings?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,657
I've been trying to track her down
for days.

120
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,201
I know Harry thinks that they split up,

121
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,653
but she's still
just as dangerous as DeVoe.

122
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,329
Right. So what?

123
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,330
Why would we send citizens after her?

124
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,875
I'm all for telling people
the truth, but...

125
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,044
Yeah, I mean, after I convinced you.

126
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,338
Yeah, I don't know if it's the best idea

127
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,007
to send people out there
to do our jobs for us.

128
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,210
No, we're inspiring them, Barry.

129
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,754
I mean, we could be the ones
to show them

130
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,589
how to do the right thing.

131
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,928
- I just got a new lead.
- Hmm.

132
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,972
Fallout.

133
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,487
So you think your psychosis
made a friend of yours disappear?

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,154
Yeah, I mean, she's a really
good friend of mine,

135
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,859
almost like a part of me.

136
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,999
So your friend,
is she with us here right now?

137
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,247
Oh, no, I'm not schizophrenic.

138
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,626
Um, she's more like another personality.

139
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,253
Dissociative identity disorder.

140
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,881
That is usually caused by trauma,

141
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,928
and from your history,
you've had quite a bit.

142
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,098
Yeah, I did see my fiancÃ© die, twice.

143
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,517
And then my next boyfriend turned evil.

144
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,971
I actually meant childhood trauma.

145
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,806
Tell me about your father.

146
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,438
My dad? He was the best.

147
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,236
Loving, supportive,
always pushed me to get smarter.

148
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,484
And how did you feel when he passed?

149
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,692
He had ALS.

150
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,244
He was always hiding
his symptoms from us.

151
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,908
He never wanted us to see him suffer.

152
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,909
Sometimes when we're young,
we repress things that scare us.

153
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,120
Oh, I'm not repressing anything
from my childhood.

154
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,464
My missing friend just appeared
a couple of years ago.

155
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,091
It's my adult life
that's got me like this.

156
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,045
I'm so sorry. I have to go. Um...

157
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,509
Do you charge by the hour?

158
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,556
For you and your friends,

159
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,642
the quarter-hour.

160
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,806
I got a tip about Fallout, but it's
been scrambled by Kilg%re's code.

161
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,392
Hmm. Not anymore.
Consider it unscrambled.

162
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,440
Devoe. Where's A.R.G.U.S.
keeping Borman? Do we know?

163
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,692
I can't ping Lyla, but I can try Digg.

164
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,898
I'll just go get him.

165
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,525
- Uh...
- Trash can.

166
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,030
- How about the recycling?
- No.

167
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,072
- No, I got it. I got it.
- Really?

168
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,245
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

169
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,206
I'm sorry, man.

170
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,705
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,462
Can we just... I'm sorry.

172
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,464
I hate you. What is this about?

173
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,508
Neil Borman, the man we left
with you, with A.R.G.U.S.,

174
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,634
where are you keeping him?

175
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,392
Barry, that's classified information.
I'm not the director of A.R.G.U.S...

176
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,470
Digg, we don't have time, please.

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,227
He's at a place called the Castle.

178
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,942
It's 1,000 miles away from anything.

179
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,232
Please, can you check it?

180
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,328
Okay, looks like everything's fine
in A.R.G.U.S. except for me.

181
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,574
Um...

182
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,954
It says I checked in six hours ago.

183
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,703
DeVoe can shape-shift.

184
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,665
With Melting Point's powers,
he can trick a DNA scanner

185
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,295
and take over the building.

186
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,475
Hey, Diggle. Diggle, Diggle.

187
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,226
Ten thousand rads and climbing.

188
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,852
Borman's body's gone critical already.

189
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,309
We can't save him.

190
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,609
If that chamber hits 100K,

191
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,231
it'll start generating nuclear fusion,

192
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,071
like core-of-the-sun fusion.

193
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,193
Infinite fuel.

194
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,819
He's using Borman's body as a battery.

195
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,693
That's the last piece of the machine.

196
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,537
Wait, a battery? Borman's containment
cell is 10 feet tall.

197
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,034
And DeVoe has the power
to shrink it down.

198
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,034
It'll charge the satellites.
All he'll have to do is launch them.

199
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,460
How long do we have?

200
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,084
At this rate of fusion, we have...

201
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,376
12 hours until the Enlightenment begins.

202
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,098
Okay, Digg's back in Star City.

203
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,429
Now, I'm going after DeVoe.

204
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,389
Don't go storming the Castle just yet.

205
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,977
You're looking at motion-activated
electroshock plates

206
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,569
that A.R.G.U.S. installed
in the facility.

207
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,817
Seventy thousand volts.

208
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,398
You hit one of those,
you'll be knocked out for sure.

209
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,983
So I'll avoid them when I go in.

210
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,739
Okay, genius idea,

211
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,947
if their placement didn't randomize
every couple of hours.

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,282
So DeVoe is basically charging
his battery for 12 hours,

213
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,584
completely protected
by A.R.G.U.S. defenses.

214
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,003
And then he'll probably just jump
into a pocket dimension,

215
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,170
and he's out of there.

216
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,548
What if I don't avoid the plates?

217
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,259
What if I hit them? All of them?

218
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,087
I'm serious.
I mean, if I go into Flashtime,

219
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,016
I could you use each plate's
electric current as a fuel source.

220
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,309
Then I'd be fast enough to follow
DeVoe into his pocket dimension.

221
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,303
You would get a serious boost.

222
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,263
Again, another genius idea

223
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,392
if hitting the plates didn't cause
an electrical explosion.

224
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,319
Yeah, but I'd be through the pocket
dimension before the blast wave.

225
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,445
Ready to blow up the satellite
on the other side.

226
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,319
The satellite results came in.

227
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,490
Okay. Oh...

228
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,744
What? What is it?

229
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,208
We got six plates and six heat
signatures above them.

230
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,377
There are A.R.G.U.S. agents
still alive in there.

231
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,795
He has hostages.

232
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,337
You can outrun an electrical explosion.
They can't.

233
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,586
How's he keeping them suspended
like that?

234
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,796
I think I know how.

235
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,981
Do you know what
my favorite thing about teaching is?

236
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,484
Having a captive audience.

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,366
I haven't moved from this spot
in three days.

238
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,819
Baby, you're gonna have to carry me
into the hospital.

239
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,496
Okay, so I got snacks.

240
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,746
I got clothes for you.
I got clothes for the baby...

241
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,330
Damn, I forgot something.

242
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,538
Joe, we are not gonna need a katana
at the hospital.

243
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,089
Okay, so you're in my head again,

244
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,711
and it's entirely possible
that we get attacked

245
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,293
by a samurai at the hospital.

246
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,720
You have already repacked that bag
five times.

247
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,968
You've read 10 different books
on birthing methods.

248
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,048
By the way, I love the one about Lamaze.

249
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,132
Yeah...

250
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,889
Damn, where is this boy?

251
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,096
You have already left Wally
a dozen voicemails.

252
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,555
He's literally on a time machine.

253
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,857
So he has no excuse
not to show up on time

254
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:57,933
to meet his new baby sister.

255
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,111
I'm sorry. It's just nerves.

256
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,484
We have both done this before.

257
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,987
There's not gonna be
any surprises, okay?

258
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,788
- This is gonna be...
- Totally sick.

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,539
Sick? Are you feeling sick?

260
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,085
No, brah. No.

261
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,418
This delivery is gonna be sick.

262
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:26,338
Having this baby
is gonna be like one epic wave.

263
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,176
Are you okay? You're scaring me.

264
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,474
Far out! That's the 'za I ordered.
'Chovies and pineapple. Tubular.

265
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,225
Tubular! Brah!

266
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,436
There's your 'za.
That'll totally be $8.50.

267
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,562
Thanks, brah.

268
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,855
Hey, this house is...

269
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,777
- Bitchin'. Yeah, everybody says that.
- No.

270
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,864
Hard to find.
Those are some gnarly bushes outside.

271
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,613
Let's crush some 'za, brah.

272
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,411
Dude... Dude?

273
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,169
Where is she?

274
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,879
Where is...

275
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,336
Uh... Where is she? I don't see her.

276
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,302
No, Harry, I'm talking about
tracking down Marlize.

277
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,720
If DeVoe has popped back up,
then she might too.

278
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,047
And we need to put her in the pipeline

279
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,632
before she causes any trouble.

280
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,716
How are you tracking her?

281
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,052
Well, my readers have sent in
hundreds of tips.

282
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,138
Plus, there's facial recognition
and credit card checks.

283
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,684
- Facts.
- Right.

284
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,232
- Wrong.
- What?

285
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,559
You're looking at facts.

286
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,609
You should be focusing on feelings.

287
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,939
You remember the Council of Harrisons?

288
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,695
- I do.
- Handsome, but annoying.

289
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,902
Well, they kind of taught me
that you if you wanna...

290
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,201
If you wanna follow DeVoe's actions,
you gotta focus on DeVoe's motives,

291
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,657
which is basically DeVoe's feelings.

292
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,538
And so feelings,

293
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:43,089
if you're Marlize DeVoe,
where are you gonna feel safe?

294
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,336
So if I dig into her past,

295
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,256
maybe I can figure out where she is now.

296
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,551
Harry, that's really helpful. Thank you.

297
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,675
Thank you, Iris West-Allen,
for saying that.

298
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,767
I don't feel helpful that much anymore.

299
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,726
So thanks.

300
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,475
Hey... Um...

301
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,111
Are you busy, Harry?

302
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,938
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

303
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,025
Um... Would you maybe wanna
help me investigate?

304
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,109
Yes.

305
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,448
- Okay, cool.
- Okay, cool.

306
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,997
- When?
- We're gonna... Right now.

307
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,001
Hey, did you guys send an alert?

308
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,421
We did. We think we figured out
how to stop DeVoe

309
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,123
and save the hostages.

310
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,333
What is it?

311
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,380
Us.

312
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,678
You bring us into Flashtime with you.

313
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,395
Look, guys, it's great, you know,
you wanna help,

314
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,063
but we can't split up in A.R.G.U.S.

315
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,436
if I'm holding onto you the whole time.

316
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,268
Well, survey says,

317
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,396
you don't have to.

318
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,856
You guys been researching me?

319
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,533
At first, we thought you were
vibrating your molecules

320
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,702
when we were in Flashtime, but that
didn't explain why we were conscious.

321
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,450
Which gave us this brain blast.

322
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,282
When you run, you don't just
tap into the Speed Force.

323
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,500
You generate Speed Force around you.

324
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,329
It's like you're creating lightning
to protect you from the friction,

325
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,504
like an aura.

326
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,423
So when I bring you into Flashtime,

327
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,252
I'm actually extending my
Speed Force aura to you?

328
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,133
And what if physical touch
just focuses those powers?

329
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,715
I could let go,

330
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,382
share my speed.

331
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,639
We'd only be able to last
a few moments before we burned out,

332
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,686
like 55 milliseconds of real time.

333
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,513
And thanks to relativity, that gives us

334
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,474
just enough time to rescue the hostages

335
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,150
while you chase DeVoe
down the rabbit hole.

336
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,646
Okay, guys, I mean, you know,
everything looks normal to me

337
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,322
when I'm in Flashtime,
but it took me months to learn

338
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,398
how to operate like that.

339
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,779
Exactly.

340
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,486
That's what makes you the perfect
candidate for training.

341
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,196
Train us.

342
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,284
I know it's a leap, Barry,
but we're running out of time,

343
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,868
and I just think it might work.

Okay.

346
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,638
Ready?

347
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,269
One second on the clock.

348
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,306
Go.

349
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,987
Oh, Flashtime, how I've missed thee.

350
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,864
Here we go.

351
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,196
Mmm, is that lightning about to hit me?

352
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,697
You wanted to do this.

353
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,036
It's working.

354
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,163
Thank you, Speed Force.

355
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,293
Okay, here we go.

356
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,917
Just remember, when you're moving
this fast, it's not about

357
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,173
running with your legs,
it's about staying calm,

358
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,471
focused, centered.

359
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,469
Otherwise, you're gonna fall
on your ass at Mach 3.

360
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,051
Yeah, okay, sensei.
I'm just opening a breach.

361
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,934
- You good?
- It's a little harder than I thought.

362
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,640
- Yeah.
- Maybe if I shift my weight...

363
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,689
Hey, you're burning up already.
You okay?

364
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,522
- I can't move my leg.
- What?

365
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,027
- My leg's not working.
- All right, stay calm.

366
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,984
Remember, concentrate.
You're slowing down.

367
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,195
Okay, I can't really concentrate.
I gotta keep it loose.

368
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,996
I gotta keep moving
if I'm gonna breach, I mean...

369
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,243
- You gotta stay calm.
- Okay.

370
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,370
I gotta get the leg to move.

371
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,328
- Now both of my legs are stuck.
- What?

372
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,246
My legs are stuck.

373
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,878
I'm working with two frozen
drumsticks here.

374
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,800
- Okay, just relax.
- What? Okay.

375
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,127
Now, I'm falling.

376
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,632
You okay?

377
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,267
Yep, yep, my legs are just asleep,

378
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,844
but I'm gonna get this.

379
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,304
- I'm telling you.
- Okay.

380
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,356
It's Joe and Cecile.
Do you think I can spare a minute?

381
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,945
I just gotta walk it off. Ah.

382
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,364
We could use a break.

383
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,068
Good news is, you're totally healthy.

384
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,704
- Thank God.
- Oh, no, Caitlin.

385
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,782
Please don't think, "Relax."

386
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,750
If you were nine months pregnant

387
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,953
and you suddenly started craving
Master Kush and Surf,

388
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,204
I don't think that you would relax.

389
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,291
Actually, I was thinking relaxin,
the hormone.

390
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,751
As we get closer to your due date,
your body releases relaxin

391
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,256
to loosen the ligaments

392
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,713
to make it easier to deliver the baby.

393
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,926
It's like you're literally stretching.

394
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,055
So you think this hormone
is stretching her meta-powers?

395
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,637
Yes, I think instead of just reading
people's minds,

396
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,063
she's now inhabiting them.

397
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,983
Great. That's great.

398
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,811
I mean, that's just one more thing
for me to talk about at therapy.

399
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,568
I mean, can you believe
what Dr. Finkel said this morning?

400
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,316
Babe, we didn't see her this morning.

401
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,651
Uh, I did.

402
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,862
She thinks that
I'm repressing something.

403
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,914
I mean, repressing something?
How crazy is that?

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,711
Oh, my God, this Erlenmeyer flask
is covered in water spots.

405
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,124
Yeah, she's definitely me.

406
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,956
Uh, here, why don't I give you this?

407
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,417
It'll help you
take some deep breaths and focus.

408
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,844
I'm familiar with an albuterol inhaler.
Thank you.

409
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,799
Oh, my God.

410
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,971
Oh, oh.

411
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,394
- I'm so sorry, Caitlin.
- Don't worry about it.

412
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,937
You're just going off my instincts.

413
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,515
How do we stop this
from happening again?

414
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,068
I don't think we can
until you give birth,

415
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,942
so I think the best thing to do
is actually keep you isolated

416
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,364
and use this.

417
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,862
Come on, we can handle that.

418
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,362
Okay, I'm gonna get back to training.

419
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,947
Thank you, Caitlin.

420
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,283
Uh, hey, Caitlin.

421
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,876
For what it's worth,

422
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,332
when I was you back there
for, like, 20 seconds,

423
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,710
it seemed like you were trying
to ignore something,

424
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,796
something really big.

425
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,468
And if there's anything that I learned

426
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,591
from having these powers,

427
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:27,049
it's that you cannot hide
from anything forever.

428
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,602
You just be careful, okay?

429
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,645
Marlize Milan, born in Cape Town.

430
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,275
Cape Town.

431
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,481
Summers by the sea.

432
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,483
Picking grapes in a vineyard.

433
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,696
Got a PhD in Inflationary Theory
and Engineering.

434
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,914
Cute, little button nose
always buried in her book.

435
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,783
So nice.

436
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,955
Tenured as a professor
of engineering at Oxford,

437
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,536
where she met Clifford DeVoe.

438
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,667
Where she met her husband-to-be.
Isn't that romantic?

439
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,001
A continent apart, and they find
each other. So romantic.

440
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,756
I mean, it's beautiful
when you think about it.

441
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,961
It's... What?

442
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,717
Beautiful? What is that?
What are you doing?

443
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,298
I'm empathetic. I'm being...

444
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,224
Council says, "Be empathetic."
I'm empathetic.

445
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,722
You know, I'm putting myself
in Marlize's shoes.

446
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,099
I should see if she's got a pair
of shoes, put myself in them.

447
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,934
No, Harry, this,
this is not a love story, okay?

448
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,393
She married a psychopath.

449
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,315
A psychopath now. Not then.

450
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,155
Back then he had feelings.
They loved each other.

451
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,574
He had feelings. She had feelings.
Then he lost the feelings,

452
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,903
and that's why she got out.
That's why she left.

453
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,238
She left.

454
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,250
West-Allen.

455
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,160
We should turn Marlize.

456
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,704
Harry, no, I don't think you
even know what you're saying.

457
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,590
I know what I'm saying.
I know. I have bad days.

458
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,463
Dumb Harry. But I'm not dumb today.

459
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,590
Today's a good day.
We should turn Marlize.

460
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,046
Marlize can help us.

461
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,881
And why would she wanna do that?

462
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,557
To stop the psychopath.

463
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,597
Right? And to protect the man
trapped inside the monster.

464
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,974
Marlize can save everybody.
Marlize is the key.

465
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,522
Harry, we've tried that already.

466
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,353
With Savitar, remember? It didn't work.

467
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,068
You can't save monsters.

468
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,645
Marlize isn't a monster.

469
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,773
And besides,

470
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,611
the clock's ticking.

471
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,943
I mean, 10 hours
before the Enlightenment.

472
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,244
What do we have to lose?

473
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,868
She stabbed me with a katana, Harry.

474
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,915
Our lives are what we have to lose.

475
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,500
We can't save anyone
if we're all dead.

476
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,747
Right.

477
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,376
We are gonna bring her in,
and we're gonna stop her

478
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,548
so she doesn't hurt anyone ever again.

479
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,171
Okay.

480
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,553
I left some of my files at home.
I'll finish my investigation there.

481
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,100
- I'm gonna come with you.
- No, I'm fine, Harry.

482
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,552
- You stay here, okay?
- I'll come with.

483
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,224
- Harry!
- I'll just stay here.

484
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,935
I'll just stay right here.

485
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,611
All right, just remember
to stay calm this time.

486
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,821
- Why are you looking at me?
- I wasn't...

487
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,368
Both of you.

488
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,199
All right. Take two.

489
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,080
- Yes!
- Nice!

490
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,210
A baby breach.

491
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,759
That's right, Barry. A baby breach.

492
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,504
And in time, she'll blossom
into maturity,

493
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,636
but for now in Flashtime,
she's my little breachling.

494
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,841
Okay.

495
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,301
Cait.

496
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,396
Cold gun is still not working,
just like Killer Frost.

497
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,307
We gotta find a way to offset
the friction.

498
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,726
Damn it!

499
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,020
- My leg's stuck.
- All right, just stay calm.

500
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,942
Hey, watch out.

501
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,035
Dad, my leg's stuck.

502
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,746
Caitlin, watch out!

503
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,199
- Caitlin.
- Cait.

504
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,179
- What happened?
- Training.

505
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,927
You came out of Flashtime in mid-air.

506
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,303
I think you got concussed.

507
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,850
Then again, I'm not the team doctor.

508
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,020
I mean, I don't feel nauseous.

509
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,730
Just hand me some acetaminophen,
and we can get back to training.

510
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,806
No, hold on.

511
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,355
We have to talk about what happened.

512
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,853
What do you mean?
You just lost focus, right?

513
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,234
- Yeah.
- No, it was...

514
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,781
I don't know.
Something pulled your focus.

515
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,408
No, I'm fine.

516
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,031
If this were the real thing,
you would have died.

517
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,704
- I'm not a liability.
- I know.

518
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,620
I am. I'm putting you guys in danger
doing this.

519
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,498
I mean, I realize you guys wanna
help, but I gotta stop training you.

520
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,999
Barry, come on, those hostages...

521
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,501
I'll find another way to save them.

522
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,798
You have to let us help you.

523
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,921
I mean, after everything DeVoe
did to us...

524
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,218
Killer Frost.

525
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,587
She's right.

526
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,965
We're running out of time.
It's worth the risk.

527
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,885
I'm not training you guys
just to get you killed.

528
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,561
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,656
West-Allen!

530
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,367
West-Allen!

531
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,953
- Of course, he followed me home.
- West-Allen!

532
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,326
West-Allen!

533
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,792
- West-Allen!
- Apartment five.

534
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,327
Hi.

535
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,455
Oh, you moved.

536
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,960
- No.
- No, this...

537
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,467
- This is apartment four.
- Four.

538
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,051
- You're in apartment five.
- Yes.

539
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,965
So, look, I just came to say
you were right.

540
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,924
I was trying to put myself
in Marlize's shoes,

541
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,057
and I forgot I should also try
to put myself in your shoes, so...

542
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,140
Thanks. It's very big of you
to admit that you were wrong, Harry.

543
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,728
I don't know if I was the word you
said. It's more like I'm dumb.

544
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,028
I'm dumb now.

545
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,321
- Harry.
- Yeah.

546
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,528
Marlize is not gonna help us
fight her husband out of love.

547
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,031
Love, exactly.

548
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,111
Look, she...

549
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,494
Look, the Enlightenment
was not born out of love.

550
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,662
She's always been an activist.
Look at that.

551
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,166
Even before she met DeVoe,
she was trying to save people.

552
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,254
Yes, her earlier papers
were very optimistic.

553
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,206
She thought that technology
could liberate humanity.

554
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,417
Humanity. Right.

555
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,297
But she's not saving anyone now.

556
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,424
Not according to your perspective.

557
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,557
What about her perspective?
Put yourself in her shoes.

558
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,974
Come in, please.

559
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,561
You know, just put yourself
in her shoes. Okay?

560
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,513
- Harry, take your shoes off.
- Yeah.

561
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,140
Yeah, put on my shoes,
and I'll put on your shoes.

562
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,441
- We'll both trade shoes.
- No, Harry.

563
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,564
I don't wanna try your shoes on.
I want you to take your shoes off.

564
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,271
You're tracking mud all through
my house, please.

565
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,736
Oh. Right. Sorry.

566
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,860
This is kind of more of a loft...

567
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,286
This is my home, okay?

568
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,113
This is the first place
that I've lived in with Barry.

569
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,956
It makes me feel loved and safe.

570
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,784
And so we're gonna keep it nice and...

571
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,660
Clean.

572
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,832
What? What is it?
What are you thinking about?

573
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,339
I think I know where Marlize is hiding.

574
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,630
Apartment four.

575
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,090
No, not apartment four.

576
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,676
Babe?

577
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,935
Babe?

578
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,974
What are you doing?

579
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,812
I gotta get this bag ready.
Uh... I got snacks. I got water.

580
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,817
I got a change of clothes for the baby.

581
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,990
I got a change of clothes for me.

582
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,908
You're me.

583
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,911
It's a whole new level of weird.

584
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,159
Stop. Give me this.

585
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,249
Sit down.

586
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,622
Okay.

587
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,178
Yeah.

588
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,638
Better?

589
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,219
Who the hell are you anyway?

590
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,804
Okay, not better. I'm calling Caitlin.

591
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,184
What are you doing in my house?

592
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,188
- Cecile, this is our house.
- Cecile?

593
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,940
Why do you keep calling me Cecile?
My name is not Cecile.

594
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,154
I'm Joe West.

595
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,489
Um... Okay, Joe. Joe!

596
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,115
Joe, sit down. Sit down.

597
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,281
Okay, I need you to take
a deep breath. In through your nose,

598
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,124
out through the mouth. Close your eyes.

599
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,204
Imagine that you're sitting

600
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,504
in a big, beautiful sea.

601
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,049
The waves are cresting over you.

602
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,130
Back and forth.

603
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,217
Those waves, that's Joe.

604
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,310
Now, look up, it's a big, dark,
beautiful sky

605
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,354
with one shining star.

606
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,402
That star is you, Cecile.

607
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,318
Great.

608
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,567
How do you feel?

609
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,487
Joe?

610
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,373
- Oh, God.
- You pulled me back.

611
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,246
How did you pull me back?

612
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,035
Lamaze?

613
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,088
I had to switch some things
up in my head, but... Hey.

614
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,587
Am I crazy, because you were...

615
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,296
Babe, trust me, there are far worse
heads I could have been stuck in.

616
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,684
I love you.

617
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,056
You figure it out yet?

618
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,360
No, I mean, I shut down the generator.

619
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,025
I could save the hostages,
but DeVoe still gets away.

620
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,322
And then, you know...

621
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,944
Actually, I meant,

622
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,117
have you figured out how come

623
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,533
you lost your damn mind?

624
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,825
Dude, I'm sorry. I'm just...

625
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,625
You're just trying to keep us safe.
I know.

626
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,668
That's starting to sound real
familiar coming out of your mouth.

627
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,293
You're not ready to use Flashtime.
Not like that.

628
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,256
We will be ready if you train us.

629
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,753
It takes more than 10 hours
to learn super speed. Okay?

630
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,927
You guys could die in there.

631
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,051
And if you don't take us,
we'll die anyway.

632
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,009
Our brains get wiped, and that's it,
that's the end of our world.

633
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,890
No, losing both of my best friends

634
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,017
and it being my fault,
that's the end of my world.

635
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,941
You may think it's worth the risk,
but I couldn't live with myself.

636
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,981
Barry, you cannot sideline us
because of what happened to him.

637
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,196
All right, I don't need
another therapist.

638
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,156
Look, we all lost somebody, okay,

639
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,492
but that never gives us an excuse
to shut each other out.

640
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,701
I said drop it, all right?

641
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,502
You think you're the only one
who feels bad about Ralph dying?

642
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,578
Guys.

643
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,460
You know, he came to see me
at Iron Heights?

644
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,507
He told me he was afraid.
He warned me he wasn't ready.

645
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,422
But I pushed him anyway.
I said go back out there

646
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,299
and do my job, my burden.

647
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,467
We made the bus metas.

648
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,471
We gave Ralph his powers.
You wanna talk about burdens?

649
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,182
I started this. I shot that bazooka.

650
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,604
I opened up the Speed Force.

651
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,976
And I didn't do it
so you could stand here

652
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,978
and tell me you're gonna save
the world alone again.

653
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,106
I know that.

654
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,525
And I know we're running out of time.

655
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,607
I can't do this by myself, but...

656
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,202
Everybody I've tried to teach
has ended up worse

657
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,324
than when I found them.

658
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,248
And what about Ralph? Was he worse?

659
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,251
You taught him that when his back
was against the wall,

660
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,624
and the world was ending around him,

661
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,957
he could always make the choice.
Make the choice to be a hero.

662
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,668
We deserve that same choice.

663
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,634
All we need is someone to show us how.

664
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,889
You guys really wanna do this?

665
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,437
It's not a burden
if we shoulder it together.

666
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,903
- We found her.
- You found Marlize?

667
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,575
I think so.

668
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,444
She's in England.

669
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,992
All right. That's our last extrapolator.

670
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,079
You set the coordinates,
it'll breach you there.

671
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,334
We have to stop DeVoe.
By the time you get back...

672
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,713
Hey.

673
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,930
I love you.

674
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,508
Go save the world.

675
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,343
I love you.

676
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,809
Where are we at?

677
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,145
Borman's almost at 100,000 rads.

678
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,102
All right, we gotta go. Come on.

679
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,990
Thank you, subject seven.

680
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,993
Now, your fire will light up the world.

681
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,206
Perimeter's secure.

682
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,383
Once we're inside,
we'll have less than a second.

683
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,131
I'll activate the plates,
draw their charge.

684
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,211
I'll lay the breachlings.

685
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,093
And I'll protect the A.R.G.U.S.
agents from the blast using this...

686
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,216
- Ice shooter.
- Ice shooter.

687
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,300
Do I have to call it an ice shooter?

688
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,931
I thought frost bite sounded good.

689
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,726
Guys, it solves the friction
offset problem by shooting ice.

690
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:23,806
Therefore it's an ice shooter.

691
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,186
- You call it an ice shooter.
- Relax.

692
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,813
It's just not that hard.

693
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,065
DeVoe must be
shrinking Borman's chamber.

694
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,658
We can do this.

695
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,506
Catch me if you can.

696
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,612
I've got the charge.

697
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,782
Breachling is go.

698
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,406
He's iced.

699
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,328
Five more to go.
Remember, stay focused.

700
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,230
We did it.

701
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,150
"Once upon a time in some remote
corner of that universe,

702
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,281
"there was a star upon which
clever beasts

703
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,829
"invented knowing."

704
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,832
You're quoting Nietzsche at me.

705
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,916
You destroyed a satellite.
Top marks, quick boy.

706
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,379
You can destroy 1,000 more,

707
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,128
and you will still march
closer to the Enlightenment.

708
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,010
I forget what Nietzsche said
about wiping minds.

709
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,587
I must have skipped
philosophy class that day.

710
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,468
Did I teach you nothing this year?

711
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,800
Has nothing pierced your thick cowl?

712
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,598
Think of it. Or rather don't.

713
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,055
You'll just end up hurting yourself,
so let me explain.

714
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,607
A world, enlightened.

715
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,652
Within a day all soldiers
will lay down their arms.

716
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,322
Every nuclear weapon will be disarmed
within six months.

717
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,659
Poverty, famine, disease eradicated.

718
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,953
We will clean up the streets.

719
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,908
People will put down their idiot phones
and become curious again,

720
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,835
and I will be there to teach them.

721
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,506
I, not you, will save this
godforsaken world.

722
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,672
No, you'd just control it.
You wanna take away free will.

723
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:43,006
A pittance for humanity to pay
to know peace.

724
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,011
But we wouldn't know each other.

725
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,472
Parents wouldn't remember their kids.

726
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,978
Husbands wouldn't remember their wives.

727
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,651
Good. You hit upon precisely the point.

728
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,064
Emotion is the father of all error.

729
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,150
Chemicals in our brain that distract us,

730
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,609
impede progress,

731
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,490
and the most destructive
and ridiculous imbalance of all

732
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,917
is that thing you feebles call "love."

733
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,668
I learned this from experience,
Mr. Allen.

734
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,586
And soon, you will too.

735
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,102
What happened in there?

736
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,149
All that matters
is that you're all safe.

737
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,443
But DeVoe. Where's DeVoe?

738
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,521
Hey. Hey, don't worry.

739
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,738
- The Flash is on it.
- Thank you.

740
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,489
What's wrong?

741
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,781
I need your help.

742
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,830
Back when we were training,
I had this fragment

743
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,001
of a memory.

744
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,668
I think it's something that I've been
repressing for a long time.

745
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,042
I don't remember much,
just that I was young,

746
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,755
and I was terrified.

747
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,514
Caitlin, are you sure you want me
to vibe you there?

748
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,010
I mean, maybe your brain

749
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,058
kept this memory under lock and key
for a reason.

750
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,761
I need to know what it was.

751
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:12,971
I can handle it.

752
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,814
Then focus on it

753
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,890
and hang on.

754
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,655
Caity. Oh, no! Caity!

755
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,651
Caity, are you okay?
Stay still, we're getting...

756
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,326
That's me.

757
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,654
- Right there.
- What are you doing?

758
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,576
Caity! Honey, don't!

759
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,381
Killer Frost, she was part of you.

760
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,041
Even then.

761
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,218
The particle accelerator
hadn't exploded.

762
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,089
How is that possible?

763
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,723
Empty.

764
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,975
But this is their first place together.

765
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,026
She would come here. I can feel it.

766
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,448
The pot's still warm.

767
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,238
That means...

768
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,952
- We can have tea.
- No.

769
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,660
- Marlize!
- Iris, she's not here.

770
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,158
- Come out.
- Iris.

771
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,994
It's rude to breach
into a person's home uninvited.

772
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,047
And dangerous when that person's
holding a grudge and a katana.

773
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,508
Why are you here?

774
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,090
I got this.

775
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,054
We're here, Marlize...

776
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,842
We're here because of you.

777
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,351
Because we... You...

778
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,143
You've...

779
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,352
I can't.

780
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,981
You can't verbalize it. Not anymore.

781
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,439
Just like we hypothesized,
but never observed before.

782
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:51,410
You're experiencing the penultimate
stages of the Enlightenment.

783
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,908
Your mind is being rebooted.

784
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,788
Soon you'll be without memories,
without relationships.

785
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,961
Just a blank slate
so that Clifford may reeducate you.

786
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,299
Soon, we'll all be just like you.

787
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,719
Marlize, we have to stop him.

788
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,297
Your husband has gone too far,
and I think you know it,

789
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,677
or you'd be with him right now.

790
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,474
Yes, I left my husband,

791
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,311
but that doesn't change the fact
that he's right.

792
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,648
If anything, his betrayal proves
his very point.

793
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,817
Man corrupts even the best of ideas.

794
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:29,403
Pessimism isn't smarter than optimism.

795
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,195
"In this life, the bravest thing
you can be is optimistic."

796
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:35,745
Familiar words.

797
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,949
You said them when you were at Oxford,

798
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,625
two weeks before you met Clifford DeVoe.

799
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,080
I gave a speech on technology

800
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,789
and the elimination of world hunger.

801
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,966
I truly believed it could be done.

802
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,009
He tried to change you, Marlize.

803
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,844
But I think deep down,
you are still an optimist.

804
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,844
You still believe in humanity.

805
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,516
And I believe in you.

806
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,688
You asked me what I was willing
to do for my husband,

807
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,232
and now I'm gonna ask you,

808
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,863
what are you willing to do
for the world?

809
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,079
Barry shot down one of the satellites.

810
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,580
He did it.

811
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,037
DeVoe didn't seem to care.

812
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,791
I'll try and see if I can track...

813
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,465
Uh, I don't like that sound.

814
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,919
It says a S.T.A.R. Labs satellite
has been activated.

815
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,003
It's DeVoe.

816
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,510
He's using our satellite to replace
the one you destroyed.

817
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,841
Well, can you stop him?

818
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,688
He's here.

819
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,397
<i>Hello, Professor DeVoe.</i>

820
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,730
No, no, no. Come on.

821
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:53,899
Come on.

822
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,653
DeVoe!

823
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,617
<i>DeVoe! DeVoe!</i>

824
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,787
<i>Initiating Enlightenment protocol.</i>

825
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,417
Let there be light.

826
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,925
He did it.

827
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,472
The Enlightenment.

828
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,594
What are we gonna do?

829
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,428
I don't know.

830
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,103
God saw. It was good.

831
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:35,127
