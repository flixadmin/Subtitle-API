490
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,672
And then, of course, there's
that little issue of the bomb

491
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,870
that destroyed your home.

492
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,871
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't.

493
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,880
Play by your rules.

494
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,673
Like it or not,

495
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,183
you live in that
world now, too.

496
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,189
You wanna know
how to kill a shadow?

497
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,552
You just shine
a little light on it.

498
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,318
If you get the
God's Eye for me,

499
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,020
I've already got authorization

500
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,324
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

501
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,366
You go from the hunted
to the hunter.

502
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,799
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

503
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,696
More importantly,

504
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,571
you and your family don't
go to any more funerals.

505
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,213
You get Ramsey,
you get the God's Eye,

506
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,641
you get Shaw.

507
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,518
Well, that's the wind-up
and the pitch.

508
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,883
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

509
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,389
and highly
classified information,

510
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:56,995
what do you think, Toretto?

511
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,425
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

512
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,058
Good.

513
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,927
But it'll be my way.

514
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:05,824
And my crew.

515
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,927
I assumed you might say that.

516
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,729
Which is why I've taken the
liberty of gathering your team.

517
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,344
This is crazy.

518
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,253
What the hell is
going on in here?

519
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,202
MR. NOBODY: Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

520
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,060
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

521
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,895
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

522
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,094
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

523
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,897
Ramsey is as good as gone.

524
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,097
ROMAN: So let me
get this straight.

525
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,730
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

526
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,867
sheer drops on every side,

527
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,571
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

528
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,136
from one mile in
either direction?

529
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,805
Yeah, that's about it.

530
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,982
You done? No, I'm not done.

531
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,211
So you all wanted me
to break into

532
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,880
a police station. Fine.

533
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,981
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

534
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,922
I wasn't happy about it,
but I did it.

535
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,151
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

536
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,664
to shoot down one of the
largest airplanes ever.

537
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,325
I shot that shit
out of the sky. Mmm.

538
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:13,825
It's nothing.

539
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,237
But this right here, my friend,

540
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,566
happens to be

541
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,008
the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of in my life.

542
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,238
I forgot that you were the only
one to bring the plane down.

543
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,462
No, no. The only thing I've
ever seen him take down was.

544
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,642
"No Knees" Denise.

545
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,513
Remember, at prom?

546
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,643
Really, Brian? You're gonna
do that right here'?

547
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,288
See, y'all trying to get me off my point.
(LAUGHING)

548
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,484
All I'm saying is, I'm tired
of everybody around me

549
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,652
making all the decisions.

550
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,195
This time, I lead.

551
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,528
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I'm out.

552
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,362
All right, Roman.

553
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,095
What do you got?

554
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,967
I mean, I wasn't trying to get into the
whole leadership thing, like, now.

555
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,442
You know what I'm saying?

556
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,604
I was just, kind of, talking
about, like, at some point.

557
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,806
Like, you know, when we...

558
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,777
Whatever. I mean, I think...

559
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,812
Let's hit it from here.

560
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,151
I don't think that that's...
No, no, no, don't think.

561
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,122
That's my job. (SHUSHING)

562
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,516
<i>Okay.</i>

563
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,494
It is impossible
to hit it there.

564
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,830
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain.

565
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,336
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

566
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,663
See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

567
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,334
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

568
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,035
As much as I hate to admit it,

569
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,172
he's onto something there.

570

00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,406

572
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,480
I think we got a plan.

573
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,351
Completely wrong thinking.

574
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,411

You see? I'm good at this.

576

"Good"? Okay.

577

on getting on that road?

578
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,262
Well, Tej?

579
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,903
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

580

That's what good leaders do.

accomplished with your team.

I've gotta say, Dom,

you've truly got a gift.
