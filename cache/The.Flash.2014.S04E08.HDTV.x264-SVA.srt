1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:02,804
Previously on "Crisis on Earth-X"...

2
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:04,547
- To Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:05,641
Are you asking me to marry you?

4
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:06,758
- I am.
- Just forget about it.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,126
- Felicity.
- I don't want to marry you!

6
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,469
I just called off my engagement.

7
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,117
To making things go away.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,586
Does anyone have just cause

9
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,307
why these two should not be married?

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,851
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

11
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:18,435
Nazis?

12
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:19,852
Why would Nazis want
to crash my wedding?

13
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,813
There's a 53rd earth called Earth-X.

14
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:23,899
Basically our Earth with one difference.

15
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:24,968
The Nazis won the war.

16
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,944
I call it "Calm After the Firestorm."

17
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:28,839
No powers for either of us?

18
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,809
The other archer and flying woman

19
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,828
are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X,

20
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,559
and Thawne is working with them.

21
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:36,246
The general is dying.

22
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,948
All we need is a new heart.

23
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,703
And we found the perfect donor.

24
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,484
I don't think this is our Earth.

25
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:48,625
_

26
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:04,242
Eyes front!

27
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:08,846
So this crap-hole's Earth-X.

28
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:11,181
- Wells was right.
- He usually is.

29
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,901
It's hard to believe a place
like this actually exists

30
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:16,086
on any Earth.

31
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:17,488
I wish I shared your sentiment,

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,073
but in all my travels to distant times,

33
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:23,927
one thing which sadly remains
constant is men's ability

34
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:26,000
to feel hatred for other men.

35
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,436
Keep moving.

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
Move!

37
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:33,171
All prisoners, stay away from the gate.

38
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:36,907
Stars and triangles...

39
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,676
Badges used to identify

40
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,801
purported crimes these
people have "committed"

41
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,081
to land in here.

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,520
What's the pink triangle for?

43
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,555
What did you do?

44
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:53,090
I loved the wrong person.

45
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,295
We got to get out of these things.

46
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,565
- Transmute us out.
- With pleasure.

47
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:05,135
I can't vibrate through them either.

48
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,337
Power-dampening collars.

49
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,073
Well, why are we wearing them, then?

50
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:11,862
Doesn't matter.

51
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,978
There's too many guards here anyways.

52
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,447
They're gonna kill my sister.

53
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,128
Look, we're not gonna let that happen,

54
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,450
Alex, I promise you.

55
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,849
We're gonna get back to
our Earth before then.

56
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,587
How? We don't even know how we got here.

57
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:25,689
No, we don't. We're gonna figure it out.

58
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,895
Then we're gonna find a way
to get out of this place,

59
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,098
and we're gonna get back
to the people we love.

60
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,263
I hope everyone else is okay.

61

63
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,253
Oh!

64
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:59,357
Rip Van Ramon awakens.

65
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,428
This doesn't look like a wedding.

66
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,528
You missed quite a bit, Cisco.

67
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,531
All you need to know
is that you are locked

68
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,670
in one of your fabulous
anti-meta-human cells

69
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,072
with the rest of us.

70
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,070
- We can't escape.
- Of course we can't.

71
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,142
That's what I designed them for, genius.

72
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:21,278
Good command of the obvious.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,614
- Boys.
- Is that a ball?

74
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,382
Why? Is it bothering you?

75
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:27,851
Yes.

76
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,153
God. Hey!

77
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,062
Are they gonna do that the
whole time we're in here?

78
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,273
- Ow!
- Probably.

79
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,997
- It hurts! Cut it out!
- Cut what out?

80
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:47,438
S.T.A.R. Labs.

81
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,441
It feels like old times, doesn't it?

82
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:54,945
You know, I, uh... I built this place...

83
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,048
with my own hands and called it home

84
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,985
for 15 years, and do you know what?

85
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:06,590
I hated every minute of it.

86
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,991
Where are my friends?

87
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,538
Your friends, they're on Earth-X.

88
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,298
I wouldn't worry about your
friends too much because...

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,307
they're not going to
be alive much longer.

90
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:21,776
Oh, honey.

91
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,008
It's because of the red sunlight.

92
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,577
And trust me,

93
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,195
it'll make you weaker than
you can possibly imagine.

94
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:41,250
You did all this just... just to get me?

95
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,794
Do you know how many
innocent people you killed?

96
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,663
Their lives to save mine?

97
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:48,932
Well, they should feel honored.

98
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,871
It's a strange sensation, isn't it...

99
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:57,474
feeling vulnerable?

100
00:04:57,476 --> 00:05:01,015
And it's just gonna get worse

101
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,484
because this red sunlight,

102
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,214
it's softening you up

103
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,083
until pretty soon,

104
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,419
I'm gonna crack you open like a walnut.

105
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,729
Then I'm gonna take your healthy heart.

106
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,399
I'm gonna put it in her.

107
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:20,297
Which means we should
probably get you going.

108
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,465
Good.

109
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,401
That'll give me time to talk to...

110
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,969
myself.

111
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,376
Did you hear that?

112
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,296
- Everyone else is on Earth-X.
- And Kara only has a few hours

113
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,999
before they go full Mengele on her.

114
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,149
- We gotta stop them.
- Got any ideas?

115
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,091
I don't know. Give
me some time to think.

116
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,028
Iris, I'm all for girl
power and everything,

117
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,764
but how are you and I gonna
stop the meaner, Nazi version

118
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,099
of my whatever he is right now and...

119
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,690
People with superpowers?

120
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,226
We don't have to.

121
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,204
We just need to get to
the pipeline and get Cisco.

122
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,667
He could turn off all
the power to the building

123
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,752
and breach us out of here.

124
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,633
Do you know w to get to
the pipeline from here?

125
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:00,370
I think so.

126
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,088
Lead the way, McClane.

127
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:05,184
Move!

128
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,657
Move!

129
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,092
I don't like the looks of this.

130
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,994
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

131
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:17,530
- Keep moving!
- What are we doing?

132
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:19,999
- It's roundup time.
- Roundup for what?

133
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,948
Move!

134
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,672
In line, now.

135
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,871
So these are...

136
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,874
the heroes.

137
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,488
Yes, Sturmbannfuehrer.

138
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:58,104
Blonde hair...

139
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,994
blue eyes... This is Nordic perfection.

140
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:07,580
Why would you align
yourself with the unpure?

141
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:09,737
Because I like men

142
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,471
and I like women.

143
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:21,293
You know, I had a daughter
who looked just like you,

144
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:24,497
with similar compulsions.

145
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,903
And I expunged that filth

146
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,574
from my family line forever.

147
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,327
Bring them all.

148
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:46,776
And him!

149
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:51,901
Move! Now!

150
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,071
Go!

151
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:02,001
Not to be an alarmist, but if
we don't have an escape plan,

152
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,637
I suggest we get one immediately.

153
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,067
Up!

154
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,583
Go.

155
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,432
Turn around.

156
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:13,635
I know you are not him,

157
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:16,506
but I cannot stomach
the sight regardless.

158
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,274
Ready!

159
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,698
I'm sorry, Kara.

160
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,901
Aim!

161
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,441
I hate "fire."

162
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:53,041
Snart?

163
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,430
Snart?

164
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,543
About time!

165
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:02,284
Kill them all!

166
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,688
Take cover!

167
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,495
Hey, you're cutting it close.

168
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:26,789
I thought that was great timing.

169
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,710
I really enjoyed the pun.

170
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,478
So you're Leonard Snart's doppelganger.

171
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,948
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

172
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,450
That is a fantastic outfit.

173
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,378
Did you make that?

174
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,113
- Leo.
- Right.

175
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,156
Time to make you shine, buddy.

176
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,891
Uh, you, uh...

177
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,360
You might want to close your eyes.

178
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:47,495
Why?

179
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:55,737
Well, I believe he just
answered your question.

180
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,618
Come on, let's go.

181
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,852
Where are we going?

182
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,633
- To our base.
- Your base?

183
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,990
- And... and who are you?
- I was thinking exactly

184
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,691
the same thing about you all.

185
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,722
You might have to tell us on the way.

186
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,311
You're looking more human.

187
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:41,227
Scared, helpless, pathetic... inferior.

188
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,285
We're not that different from them.

189
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,488
Oh, please. We're
everything they want to be:

190
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,724
blonde, white.

191
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,644
Aryan perfection.

192
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,380
I'm not like you.

193
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:55,517
I don't think I'm better
than everyone else.

194
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,965
You should.

195
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,745
You are.

196
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:01,215
You're a god to them.

197
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,371
You could have been living like one.

198
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,806
Like you?

199
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,241
Yes, like me.

200
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:09,177
They want someone to bow to,

201
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,941
to worship, to lead.

202
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:14,706
What you're doing is not leading.

203
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,442
It's ruling.

204
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,574
Yes, it is.

205
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,941
They're like ants, Kara.

206
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:25,344
They shouldn't fear
us for what we can do.

207
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,781
They should rely on
us when they need us.

208
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:31,486
Oh, spare me the Good Samaritan crap.

209
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,355
I'm not gonna take
advantage of anyone,

210
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,858
just because I can.

211
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,026
The world isn't made better

212
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,574
by protecting the weak.

213
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:40,089
It's made better by getting rid of them.

214
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,163
You really are pathetic.

215
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,032
You know, I saw you at the wedding.

216
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,735
By yourself.

217
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,738
Poor, lonely little Kara.

218
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,076
Can't even find a date to a wedding.

219
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,545
You don't know what
you're talking about.

220
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,180
It's written all over

221
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:09,386
that pouty little face of yours.

222
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,388
You spend so much time on your planet

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,523
taking care of everyone but yourself.

224
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:19,562
No wonder you seem so utterly miserable.

225
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,664
It's not going to work.

226
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,175
You're not gonna get what you want.

227
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,369
Really?

228
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,550
Why do you care if I take your heart?

229
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,711
You're not using it.

230
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,808
At least I have one.

231
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,331
We're almost ready.

232
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,163
Clear.

233
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,561
I know bad guys have inopportune timing,

234
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,367
but this is, like,
the worst timing ever.

235
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,317
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

236
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,819
Barry and I were just
about to get married.

237
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,871
At least you guys left on good terms.

238
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,182
The last thing I said to
Oliver was, "I don't want

239
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,856
to marry you," and now
he's stuck in Nazi world.

240
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:10,891
I mean, what if we never see them again?

241
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,683
Stop!

242
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,355
Hands in the air!

243
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:26,829
That was extremely badass.

244
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,664
Same to you.

245
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,799
Cisco.

246
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,834
- Cisco?
- Hey!

247
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,628
Guys, we're trapped in here!

248
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,831
We're gonna get you of here!

249
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,409
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

250
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,211
- What?
- I can't open the blast door.

251
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,613
You mean they're trapped?

252
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,016
I'll send an SOS to the Legends.

253
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,784
How long will it take
for them to get it?

254
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,920
Depends where they are in time.

255
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,122
We can't wait that long.

256
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:57,746
It's up to us to save Kara.

257
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,443
I guess we're in Earth-X's Star City.

258
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,779
I have to say, that's
one hell of a story.

259
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,871
You're a speedster. Yeah.

260
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,684
Okay, you two turn into the burning man.

261
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,352
Yup.

262
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,488
And you're the good
doppelganger of the Fuehrer.

263
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,258
"Good" might be an oversimplification.

264
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,560
You still haven't told us
which Earth you're from.

265
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,130
Clearly, it's not this one.

266
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,798
We're from Earth-1.

267
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,005
Earth-1? Well...

268
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:40,035
golly.

269
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,338
Am I missing something here?

270
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,601
I'm from Earth-1 too.

271
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,118
If you're from our Earth,

272
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:47,921
then you know how we
got here, don't you?

273
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,961
Yeah, I have a pretty good idea.

274
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,165
I think you guys...

275
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:56,002
came through this.

276
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,825
- A temporal gateway?
- Same physics as a breach,

277
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:04,061
- just more stable and larger.
- Yeah, much larger.

278
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,197
So we have a way to get back.

279
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,489
So where is this thing?

280
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:12,074
It's actually not too far from here.

281
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,036
22.3 kilometers, to be exact.

282
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,423
- Well, we'd drive there.
- Good.

283
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,239
So take us to it.

284
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,076
- Can't do that.
- Why?

285
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,111
Because the gateway's
in a facility guarded

286
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,981
by a not-so-small army of Nazis.

287
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,750
Yeah, well, we've faced worse, so...

288
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,518
Look, it's our only way home.

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,820
We're going through it.

290
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:33,422
Nobody's going through anything.

291
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,825
Because we're blowing it the hell up.

292
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,084
- Winn?
- Please,

293
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,167
- Freedom Fighter General Schott.
- General Schott?

294
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,959
Yeah, and who are you?

295
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,695
New friends from Earth-1.

296
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,130
They're on our side.

297
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:51,965
Except for the part where you guys

298
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,500
want to blow up our only way home.

299
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:54,686
We don't exactly want to.

300
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,479
Everyone we care about
is on the other side

301
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,322
of that gateway, imprisoned by Nazis.

302
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,709
The Nazis that want
to cut open my sister.

303
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:02,776
- We have to get back.
- Eliminate that facility,

304
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,278
and you eliminate our only chance

305
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,154
of saving our friends from your enemies.

306
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,373
I'm sorry, but we've been waiting

307
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,906
for an opportunity like this for years.

308
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,783
We cannot wait any longer.

309
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,997
This is our only chance

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,819
to separate the Fuehrer from his army.

311
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:15,697
We are trying to turn this war around.

312
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,596
You are gonna leave
our Earth at the mercy

313
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,277
of the three psychopaths
who have ravaged yours.

314
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,581
Wait, why does this man look exactly

315
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,369
like the Fuehrer I am trying to kill?

316
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,999
Look, fingerless
gloves, all we are asking

317
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,634
is for a little bit of time.

318
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:30,370
Let us get into the facility
and through that gateway.

319
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,760
The gateway is guarded
by 30 Panzer Xils,

320
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:35,676
50 Sturmtigers, and 100
Schutzstaffel officers.

321
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:38,412
- Not the best odds, maybe.
- I'll take them.

322
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,112
No, you will not.

323
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,549
We are blowing up
that gateway right now.

324
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,005
Final order.

325
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,494
Sorry he's a little
rough around the edges.

326
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:52,075
But he is the general, and
he's issued his commands.

327
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,337
Hey, hey, hey.

328
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,162
You won't change his mind. No one does.

329
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,498
Look, on my Earth, he
and I are like family.

330
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,469
And he would do anything
to help my sister.

331
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,333
Ray, let her try.

332
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,260
You don't seem tooknow
how to take an order.

333
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,388
That's because I'm used to giving them.

334
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,987
You can't do this, Winn.

335
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,524
General Schott.

336
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:26,488
Look, I don't know where
the hell you think you are,

337
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,940
but this planet has been
at war for generations.

338
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,831
We are tired.

339
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,583
There are men dying

340
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,702
for the same causes
their grandfathers did.

341
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:39,272
We're not asking you to surrender.

342
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,641
Hey, just... just let us get back home

343
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,243
before you destroy that thing.

344
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,078
I-I'm just asking for a little time.

345
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,247
Time is what I can't give you.

346
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,990
They have a weapon...

347
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:55,627
a doomsday weapon powerful enough

348
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,165
to affect other worlds.

349
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,937
It has to be eliminated.

350
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,767
Winn.

351
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,769
Please.

352
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:11,371
The Fuehrer on your Earth,

353
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,073
the people that you hate,

354
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,408
they're going to kill my sister

355
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,263
if you don't let me
get back to save her.

356
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:24,051
On my Earth, my sister
is your closest friend.

357
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,987
She's saved you countless times.

358
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:29,089
You would do anything to help her.

359
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,124
You would do anythiig to help each other,

360
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:34,861
no matter the risk, without question.

361
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:40,167
So all I'm asking for is a chance.

362
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:41,369
Please.

363
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:49,309
I am sorry about your sister

364
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,478
and about your Earth.

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,681
I truly am.

366
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:57,484
But today I have the chance

367
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:00,087
to protect my people,

368
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,822
my Earth.

369
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:03,857
My decision stands.

370
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,255
Winn.

371
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,327
Jefferson?

372
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,696
Uh, Grey, I'm busy, man.

373
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,565
Yes, I can see that, but I was hoping

374
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:18,768
you might take a moment
away from your ruminations

375
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:22,008
on dystopian lternative
history to accept my apology.

376
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,677
I may be a learned man,

377
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,143
but I am not always an astute one.

378
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:27,013
I think I was just so thrilled

379
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:29,478
with the reality of
my imminent departure

380
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,682
that l neglected to
consider your feelings.

381
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:34,087
Look, man, I'm not trying to
take you away from your family

382
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,791
- or nothing...
- You are my family.

383
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:41,061
Long before I unexpectedly
found myself with a daughter,

384
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:44,237
I found myself unexpectedly with a son.

385
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,533
- Yeah, I know. I ju...
- You know.

386
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:48,935
You know, do you?

387
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,271
Look around you. We're
standing in one of the...

388
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,874
darkest places imaginable.

389
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:57,077
Yet somehow I'm
optimistic. Do you know why?

390
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,474
'Cause you're a crazy old man.

391
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,413
Yes. No!

392
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:05,085
Because I'm standing here with you.

393
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:09,089
You are a better son than
I could have ever hoped for.

394
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,615
And no length of time or distance

395
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,128
will ever change that.

396
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:18,931
A'ight. Apology accepted. Come here.

397
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,208
What are you doing?

398
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,243
Looking for a gun...

399
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:35,113
or knife... anything.

400
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:36,781
Okay, I don't care how many Sturmtigers

401
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:37,949
they have out there.

402
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,317
I'm gonna go save Kara,

403
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,919
with or without the
help of these people.

404
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,253
No, you're not.

405
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:44,022
I'm a government agent

406
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:46,836
certified in over 30 military weapons.

407
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,639
And you're impressive,
I'll give you that.

408
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,841
But you still can't fight your way

409
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:54,032
through an army of
Nazis alone and scared.

410
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,633
I'm not scared.

411
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:57,813
No, not for you. For yoor sister.

412
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:03,242
I should've done more.

413
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:06,969
I mean, if I hadn't
gotten so... distracted.

414
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,073
Well, sorry to be a distraction.

415
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,608
You don't understand.

416
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:13,145
I can't lose her.

417
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:15,649
I understand more than you think.

418
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:21,993
I lost my sister.

419
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:25,263
The anger and guilt that I felt

420
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:28,400
for not being able to save her

421
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:31,035
took me down a dark path.

422
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,937
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

423
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,258
How could you?

424
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,494
I mean, the only thing we
know about each other is...

425
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:38,964
what we look like with clothes off.

426
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,134
Beautiful, by the way.

427
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:44,727
You also don't know
that I protect my team,

428
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,055
and you, Danvers, you're on my team.

429
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:50,602
And I promise you, we're not gonna let

430
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,539
what happened to my
sister happen to yours.

431
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,102
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,081
I just want to... I want to save Kara,

433
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,384
and I want to get back to Maggie.

434
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:02,079
- Maggie is?
- Complicated.

435
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,094
Yeah. I had a Maggie too.

436
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:08,065
And I think about going back to her...

437
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,734
all the time.

438
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:12,238
Look, Alex.

439
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,241
You seem like a pretty
thoughtful person.

440
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,918
And if you thought it
wasn't gonna work out

441
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,196
and had to end it,

442
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,233
I'm sure that reason was valid.

443
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,165
Trust your instincts.

444
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:29,093
Ray, please, let's talk to him.

445
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:30,829
Look, you said to let Alex try.

446
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:31,852
I let her try.

447
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,696
- She didn't succeed.
- So that's that?

448
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:36,066
We just let these poor
strangely dressed individuals

449
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:37,502
lose their one way home?

450
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,370
Look, it's what Winn ordered,

451
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:42,899
and I am not in the habit of
defying generals on any Earth.

452
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:46,404
And what abouttyour
family back on Earth-1?

453
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,073
What about them?

454
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,910
You'd be giving up any chance
of ever seeing them again.

455
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,746
Leo...

456
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,524
why are you pushing this?

457
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,055
- Pardon?
- We have fought

458
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:58,406
and bled and sacrificed for this war.

459
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,953
And then these strangers show up

460
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:02,281
and you're willing to throw
everything away for them?

461
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:04,862
The fate of the world is at stake.

462
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,998
So are the lives of their loved ones.

463
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,399
Come on.

464
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,735
Tease me all you want
for being sentimental.

465
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:12,470
These heroes would risk everything

466
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:15,210
for the people they
love, just like I would...

467
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:17,580
for you.

468
00:24:25,452 --> 00:24:27,485
You know I can't say no

469
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:28,853
when you look at me like that.

470
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:30,859
That is why I look at you like that.

471
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:41,766
We talked to the general,
and after a lot of arguing,

472
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:44,903
- he agreed, so...
- We're gonna help you out.

473
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:50,858
Now, you referenced 100 guards.

474
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,758
I assume most of them
are around the perimeter?

475
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,185
- Correct.
- All right.

476
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,654
We fight through them outside.

477
00:24:55,656 --> 00:24:57,155
We access the main corridor.

478
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:58,957
What is security like inside the hangar?

479
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,492
I'll do some recon.

480
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,527
So the entire facility

481
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,262
has meta-human dampeners.

482
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:07,132
Okay, we can't take that
hangar with no powers, man.

483
00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:09,801
These satellites indicate a
control room off the hangar.

484
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,236
That must be where the dampener is.

485
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:12,937
Okay, well, we definitely can't take

486
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,140
the main control room with no powers.

487
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:17,090
It's not like we blend in here.

488
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:25,265
I think I know how to get in.

489
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:29,155
I'm allowiig this mission
against my better judgment.

490
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:30,811
You have one hour.

491
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,851
I appreciate it. We all do.

492
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,366
Yeah, I know. I know
what you're thinking.

493
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,871
If you don't make it
through the gateway,

494
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,085
I am not giving you more time.

495
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:48,061
I will blow that place to kingdom comm.

496
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,652
Red light saturation...

497
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,722
is complete.

498
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,292
She's cooked.

499
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,132
And you will wake up stronger
than you've ever been.

500
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:11,335
I love you.

501
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,872
I love you.

502
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,943
Unfortunately, Miss Danvers,

503
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,846
we need you awake for this procedure.

504
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,382
My... my cousin...

505
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,883
he'll find you.

506
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:31,420
Your cousin.

507
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:34,156
Really? Fun tidbit.

508
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:37,293
I fought your cousin
once. In the future.

509
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,662
He is fast.

510
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,996
I'm faster.

511
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,894
They're starting the surgery.

512
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,072
I'm working on it, and...

513
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,379
Just have backup power,
and it's not enough.

514
00:27:09,382 --> 00:27:11,349
Well, everyone in the building
has been accounted for.

515
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:12,963
Where might people be hiding?

516
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,422
Take that you, Nazi mother...

517
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,991
Whho!

518
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,593
Hey, hey, hey.

519
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:45,973
Comm with me if you want to live.

520
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:47,366
Get me to the sun.

521
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,037
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

522
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,938
- I got her, I got her.
- Okay.

523
00:27:56,873 --> 00:27:59,307
We gotta go.

524
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,853
I don't believe Mr. Thawne
is done with you yet.

525
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,966
Your papers, Sturmmann.

526
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,777
We don't have papers.

527
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,088
This is a special visit.

528
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,191
Your papers. Now.

529
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,675
Suit yourself, but, uh,

530
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,476
I think you better talk to our boss.

531
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,082
As you were.

532
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,746
Mein gott. My apooogies, sir.

533
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:43,819
Let them through!

534
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,371
Let them through!

535
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:46,840
Thank you, mein Fuehrer.

536
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,627
Hail, Fuehrer.

537
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,138
Mein Fuehrer, we were...

538
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,639
We were not expecting you.

539
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:14,109
Nor was I anticipating
being back so soon.

540
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:15,643
Thanks to your incompetence,

541
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:17,312
the Earth-1 doppelgangers...

542
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:19,614
My doppelganger...

543
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,674
Escaped his execution.

544
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,677
Yes, he did.

545
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,085
And?

546
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,621
We are exhhusting every possible means

547
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,022
to locate them.

548
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:30,125
Good.

549
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:33,428
Would you like us to delay
deployment until we do so?

550
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,596
Deployment?

551
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,971
She is inbound and ready.

552
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:54,082
The doomsday device.

553
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,918
The Wellenreiter is fully operational

554
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,455
and at the ready, mein Fuehrer.

555
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:04,259
Shall we send her through?

556
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,236
As scheduled.

557
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,064
Begin!

558
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:31,152
The Wellenreiter is on its way.

559
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:32,987
Hail, victory!

560
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:34,522
Hail, victory!

561
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,324
Hail, victory.

562
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,835
- Report.
- Good news.

563
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:50,338
The Wellenreiter's made the
transition to this Earth.

564
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,707
Kara is all that matters.

565
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,642
That red sunlight
we're flooding her with,

566
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,311
that's burning off.

567
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,546
So pretty soon, her cells
will be so desaturated,

568
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,114
we cannot perform the surgery.

569
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:01,649
- Fix it.
- I can't.

570
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,643
This is your city.
This is your facility.

571
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,888
So turn the power back on.

572
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,024
I can't because the
system has been encrypted.

573
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:12,360
By who?

574
00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:13,929
By Miss Smoak.

575
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:31,179
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

576
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,580
No, that'll be all.

577
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:34,583
Very well.

578
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:43,925
Before I go, I have something
for you, mein Fuehrer.

579
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,548
A gift...

580
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,786
to celebrate your return.

581
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,900
Guard!

582
00:32:02,112 --> 00:32:05,346
Well, I know how much you
enjoy executing rule breakers,

583
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,382
and this one has broken many of them.

584
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,851
We discovered this Jewess

585
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:12,854
handing her rations to
the work camp children.

586
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:15,858
Strictly against camp rules, of course.

587
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,629
Those children were starving.

588
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,976
Well, this must be hard.

589
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:37,612
I hear your doppelganger on Earth-1

590
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:40,281
loved a woman who looks just like this.

591
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,538
Did you really think I would
hand you a loaded weapon...

592
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,599
Before verifying who you are?

593
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,519
Hey, hey, hey, you're okay.

594
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:21,622
No, no, no, you're fine. You're fine.

595
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,791
Just take this and go.

596
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,526
Why are you doing this?

597
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,837
It's the strong's duty
to protect the weak.

598
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,464
Take it and go.

599
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,009
Go!

600
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,873
Clear.

601
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,444
How did it... Oh.

602
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,746
Barry, we have a problem.

603
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,414
The gateway control's been damaged.

604
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,548
We can't turn it on?

605
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,743
We can't turn it on here,

606
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,752
but there should be a manual
override at the platform.

607
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,448
All right, we're gonna have

608
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:53,951
to fight our way through.

609
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:55,523
What do you mean? Call it back!

610
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,024
Too late. It's been programmed.

611
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:58,426
There's no changing course now.

612
00:33:58,428 --> 00:33:59,827
You said we'd have an hour.

613
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,032
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

614
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,583
The team hasn't gone
through the breach yet.

615
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,432
That team has nothing to do
with us or saving our planet.

616
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:06,901
And everyone who can threaten it

617
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:08,119
is on he other side of that breach.

618
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,487
They are not coming back through.

619
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,930
- General!
- Leo, enough!

620
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,407
I'm not risking any more time.

621
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,675
We are blowing it up.

622
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:20,548
Guys, we have a problem.

623
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,216
What kind of problem?

624
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:25,553
A weapon is heading to
blow up the facility.

625
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:28,022
A weapon? You mean a missile?

626
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,590
Not exactly.

627
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:39,907
Felicity Smoak.

628
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,942
Turn the power back on.

629
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,712
He said...

630
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,466
Felicity!

631
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,770
"Turn the power back on."

632
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,687
Sorry, Eobard. Eobard?

633
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:54,353
- Eobard.
- Eobard.

634
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,691
My Goo, the future sounds weird.

635
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:58,225
That's funny.

636
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:02,630
Sometimes we think we're
more clever than we are.

637
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,398
Because where I come from,

638
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,468
the history books are
filled with stories

639
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,837
of this Age of Heroes:

640
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,939
Green Arrow,

641
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,666
Black Canary,

642
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,543
The Flash.

643
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,979
And yet no one...

644
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:21,849
no one has ever heard

645
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:24,151
of Felicity Smoak.

646
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:25,419
Stop!

647
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,606
Stop. Stop.

648
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:32,660
You came here for me,
so just ake me, please.

649
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,337
Please don't hurt anyone else.

650
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,068
Give them the code.

651
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,400
- If I dd, they'll kill you.
- It's fine.

652
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:46,108
Nobody's gonna die because of me.

653
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:51,146
Latte, Ada, Jonas, 1-1-9-0-0.

654
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,417
Latte?

655
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:58,819
Cute.

656
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,405
Let's go.

657
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:19,740
In ten minutes, Red Tornado's

658
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,409
gonna bring down this entire acility,

659
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,364
and there's nothing we
can do to stop that robot.

660
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:24,733
Then we need to reopen the gateway

661
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,002
before that happens.

662
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:27,548
- Barry, Ray...
- We know.

663
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,116
Stop a flying robot somehow.

664
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:31,318
Good. The rest of us
will open the breach.

665
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
That's the whole plan?

666
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,522
Well, as a Snart we know used to say,

667
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,304
"Make a plan. Execute the plan.

668
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:38,041
Expect the plan to go off the rails.

669
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:39,093
Throw away the plan."

670
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,929
Wow. That is... that is terrible advice.

671
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,998
I always have a plan,
down to the second,

672
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,367
so nothing ever goes wrong.

673
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,869
No, no, no, the only plan now

674
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,804
is not to leave this
Earth... without me.

675
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:51,039
Okay.

676
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,476
Right. Ready for Tornado watch.

677
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,144
Let's do it.

678
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:00,082
I thought it'd be fun if
we put on our costumes.

679
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:04,930
Where'd you get the bow and quiver?

680
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,868
The general collects weapons.

681
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:09,405
Let's go to war.

682
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,134
No one gets to the gateway!

683
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:21,837
No one!

684
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,531
Move! Move!

685
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,059
Here we go.

686
00:38:57,633 --> 00:38:59,366
Okay, we're Nazi-free. Let's go.

687
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:01,302
Hold on. That's an automated power cell.

688
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:03,671
We need to activate it before
using the control console.

689
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,339
I can hot-wire it, no problem.

690
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:07,374
Then I'll turn on the console.

691
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,043
You want to split up? You sure?

692
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:10,277
It's our most favorable odds.

693
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,146
Let's kick some ass, Jefferson.

694
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:37,037
Grey, we got power.

695
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,384
Whoa! Hey!

696
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:52,454
Ray!

697
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:55,055
A little help here!

698
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:27,567
Oh, crap.

699
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:47,498
Well, that's not very fair.

700
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:04,075
I'm pinned down!

701
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,402
Grey! No!

702
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:43,543
