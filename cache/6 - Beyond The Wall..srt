1
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,104
- You all right?
- Hmm.

2
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,653
Never been north before?

3
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,200
Never seen snow before.

4
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,569
Beautiful, eh?

5
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,741
I can breathe again.

6
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,164
Down south,
the air smells like pig shit.

7
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,582
You've never been down south.

8
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,469
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

9
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,288
How'd you live up here?

10
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,027
How'd you keep
your balls from freezing off?

11
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,043
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

12
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,672
Walking's good.

13
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,299
Fighting's better.

14
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,722
Best.

15
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,097
There's not a living woman
within a 100 miles of here.

16
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,269
We have to make do
with what we've got.

17
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,561
This one is maybe not so smart.

18
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,396
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

19
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,731
Good.

20
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,067
That's more important
than being smart.

21
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,948
Smart people don't come up here
looking for the dead.

22
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,911
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

23
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,585
And?

24
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,913
And she'll only fight beside us
if I bend the knee.

25
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,168
You spent too much time
with the free folk.

26
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,046
Now you don't like kneeling.

27
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,305
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

28
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,223
A proud man.

29
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,848
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

30
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,356
How many of his people died
for his pride?

31
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Episode 6 - Beyond The Wall.

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,030
You still mad at us, boy?

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,208
You sold me to a witch.

34
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,580
Priestess.

35
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,587
I'll admit,
it is a subtle distinction.

36
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,665
We're fighting a great war.

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,672
- Wars cost money.
- I wanted to be one of you.

38
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,505
I wanted to join the Brotherhood
but you sold me off.

39
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,884
Like a slave.

40
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,716
Do you know what she did to me?

41
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,302
She strapped me down on a bed,
she stripped me naked...

42
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,137
Sounds all right so far.

43
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,392
...and put leeches on me.

44
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,724
Was she naked, too?

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,103
She needed your blood.

46
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,935
Yes, thank you, I know that.

47
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,110
Could have been worse.

48
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,438
She wanted to kill me.

49
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,593
In fact, they would have killed me
if it wasn't for Davos...

50
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,904
But they didn't, did they?

51
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,701
So what you whinging about?

52
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,245
I'm not whinging.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,156
Your lips are moving, and
you're complaining about something.

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,331
That's whinging.

55
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,874
This one's been killed six times.
You don't hear him bitching about it.

56
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,223
Good lad.

57
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,269
The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

58
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,187
He was a good man.

59
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,144
He deserved a better son.

60
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,272
Were you with him at the end?

61
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,866
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

62
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,243
But we avenged him.

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,281
I want you to know that.
Every mutineer found justice.

64
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,872
Can't think of a worse way
for him to go.

65
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,669
The Night's Watch was his life.

66
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,293
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

67
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,590
And they butchered him.

68
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,713
I hate that he died that way.

69
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,467
My father was
the most honourable man I ever met.

70
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,174
He was good, all the way through.

71
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,931
And he died
on the executioner's block.

72
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,851
Your father wanted
to execute me, you know.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,061
I heard.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,317
He was in the right, of course.

75
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,737
Didn't make me hate him any less.

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,856
Glad he didn't catch you.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,031
Me, too.

78
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,409
Your father gave me this sword.

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,083
Changed the pommel
from a bear to a wolf.

80
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,460
But it's still Longclaw.

81
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,971
Lord Commander Mormont

82
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,804
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

83
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,816
But you are back.

84
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,231
And it's been in your family
for centuries.

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,775
It's not right for me to have it.

86
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,777
He gave it to you.

87
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,738
I'm not his son.

88
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,667
I brought shame onto my house.

89
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,500
I broke my father's heart.

90
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,755
I've forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

91
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,392
It's yours.

92
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,224
May it serve you well,

93
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,639
and your children after you.

94
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,250
Father used to watch us from up here.

95
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,094
He wouldn't say much.

96
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,821
You probably don't remember.
You were inside knitting all the time.

97
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,885
I remember.

98
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,897
One time, the boys were
shooting arrows with Ser Rodrik.

99
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,276
I came out here after

100
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,445
and Bran had left his bow behind.

101
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,860
Just lying on the ground.

102
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,658
Ser Rodrik would have cuffed him
if he saw.

103
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,534
There was one arrow in the target.

104
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,291
There was no one around.

105
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,868
Just like now.

106
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,957
No one to stop me.

107
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,548
So I started shooting.

108
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,377
And every shot, I had to go up there

109
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,962
and get my one arrow and walk back
and shoot it again.

110
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,557
I wasn't very good.

111
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,645
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

112
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,348
Could have been the 20th shot,
or the 50th.

113
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,774
I don't remember.

114
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,190
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this...

115
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,155
I looked up,
and he's standing right here,

116
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,530
smiling down at me.

117
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,744
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

118
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,627
But he was smiling
so I knew it wasn't wrong.

119
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,338
The rules were wrong.

120
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,668
I was doing what I was
meant to be doing and he knew it.

121
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,551
Now he's dead.

122
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,933
Killed by the Lannisters.

123
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,977
With your help.

124
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,141
What?

125
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,277
That's your pretty handwriting.

126
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,683
Septa Mordane
used to crack my knuckles

127
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,323
'cause I couldn't write
as well as you.

128
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,170
"Robb, I write to you today
with heavy heart."

129
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,088
"Our good king Robert is dead."

130
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,570
"Killed from wounds
he took in a boar hunt..."

131
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,130
You don't have to read it. I remember.

132
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,781
"Father has been charged with treason."

133
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,681
"He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey"

134
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,679
"and tried to steal his throne."

135
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,388
"The Lannisters are treating me well
and providing me with every comfort."

136
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,564
"I beg you, come to King's Landing,"

137
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,518
"swear fealty to King Joffrey,
and prevent any strife"

138
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,649
"between the great houses
of Lannister and Stark."

139
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,446
"Your faithful sister, Sansa."

140
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,071
- They forced me to do it.
- Did they?

141
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,697
With a knife at your throat?

142
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,391
Did they put you on the rack
and stretch you

143
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,747
until your bones started to pop?

144
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,826
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

145
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,955
So was I.

146
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,458
I would have let them kill me
before I betrayed my family.

147
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,712
They told me it was the only way
to save Father.

148
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,884
And you were stupid enough
to believe them.

149
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,845
I remember you.

150
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,843
Standing on the platform
with Joffrey and Cersei

151
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,595
while they dragged Father
to the block.

152
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,329
I remember the pretty dress
you were wearing,

153
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,185
I remember the fancy way
you did your hair.

154
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,811
- You were there?
- I was there.

155
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,609
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

156
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,822
And what did you do?
Did you come running to the rescue?

157
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,776
Did you fight off the Lannisters
and save Father?

158
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,406
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't.

159
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,496
Just like me.

160
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,868
I didn't betray him.
I didn't betray Robb.

161
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,577
I didn't betray our entire family
for my beloved Joffrey!

162
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,881
You should be on your knees
thanking me.

163
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,590
We're standing in Winterfell again
because of me.

164
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,970
You didn't win it back.
Jon didn't win it back.

165
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,763
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

166
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,677
The Knights of the Vale won the battle
and they rode north for me.

167
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,683
While you were off, where?
Travelling the world?

168
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,773
I was training.

169
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,519
Training.

170
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,317
Well, while you were training,

171
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,861
I suffered things
you can never imagine.

172
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,236
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

173
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,619
You never would have survived
what I survived.

174
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,747
I guess we'll never know.

175
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,727
What are you going to do
with that letter?

176
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,331
I don't know yet.

177
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,877
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

178
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,337
You're scared, aren't you?

179
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,014
What are you scared of?

180
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,636
You didn't commit any crimes.

181
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,597
No one's going to hang you.

182
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,248
- Arya...
- You're scared I'll show it to Jon

183
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,272
and he'll be angry.

184
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,815
No, that's not Jon.

185
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,231
He'll understand,
you were just a scared little girl.

186
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,899
All alone with the wicked Lannisters.

187
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,733
Do you know how happy Cersei would be
right now if she saw us fighting?

188
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,026
This is exactly what she wants,

189
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,000
it's what she's always wanted,
to tear us apart.

190
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,881
You're scared the Northern lords
will read it.

191
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,625
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

192
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,668
if they knew how she did
Cersei's bidding.

193
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,086
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

194
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,300
She's younger than you were,
when you wrote this.

195
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,425
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child"?

196
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,683
You're angry.

197
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,475
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

198
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,647
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

199
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,898
I'll go with anger.

200
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,639
You're the one they call the Dog.

201
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,138
They told me you were mean.

202
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,690
Were you born mean,
or you just hate wildlings?

203
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,813
I don't give two shits
about wildlings.

204
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,401
- Gingers, I hate.
- Gingers are beautiful.

205
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,739
We are kissed by fire.

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Just like you.

207
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,361
Don't point your finger at me.

208
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,206
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

209
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,170
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

210
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,918
And ever since, you've been mean.

211
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,670
Will you

212
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,592
I don't think you're truly mean.

213
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,340
You have sad eyes.

214
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,134
You want to is that it?

215
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,345
Ah.

216
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,146
I like it.

217
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,180
I bet you do.

218
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,016
Nope, it's for me.

219
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,853
I have a beauty waiting for me
back in Winterfell.

220
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,688
If I ever get back there.

221
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,364
Yellow hair,

222
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,782
blue eyes,

223
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,860
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

224
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,490
Almost as tall as you.

225
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Brienne of Tarth.

226
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,706
You know her?

227
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,993
You're with Brienne of Tarth?

228
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,791
Well, not with her yet.

229
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,622
But I see the way she looks at me.

230
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,048
How does she look at you?

231
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,467
Like she wants to carve you up
and eat your liver?

232
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,131
You do know her.

233
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,633
We've met.

234
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,589
I want to make babies with her.

235
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,801
Think of them. Great big monsters.

236
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,727
They'd conquer the world.

237
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,477
How did a mad like you
live this long?

238
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,982
I'm good at killing people.

239
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,362
You don't look much like him.

240
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,609
Who's that?

241
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,815
Your father.

242
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,781
I suppose you favor your mother.

243
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,870
You knew him?

244
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,161
Of course I did. When he was Hand,

245
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,996
he sent me off hunting
for the Mountain.

246
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,459
Your wildling friend told me
the Red Woman brought you back.

247
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,383
Thoros has brought me back six times.

248
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,546
We both serve the same lord.

249
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,888
I serve the North.

250
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,929
The North didn't raise you
from the dead.

251
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,055
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

252
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,854
I don't know anything about him.
I don't know what he wants from me.

253
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,602
He wants you alive.

254
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:43,984
Why?

255
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,813
I don't know.

256
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,483
That's all anyone can tell me.
"I don't know."

257
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,534
So what's the point in serving a god
if none of us knows what he wants?

258
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,745
I think about that all the time.

259
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,039
I don't think it's our purpose
to understand.

260
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,080
Except one thing.

261
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,831
We're soldiers.

262
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,004
We have to know
what we're fighting for.

263
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm not fighting so some man or woman

264
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,548
I barely know can sit
on a throne made of swords.

265
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,425
So, what are you fighting for?

266
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,305
Life.

267
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,475
Death is the enemy.

268
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,562
The first enemy, and the last.

269
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,817
But we all die.

270
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,690
The enemy always wins.

271
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,064
And we still need to fight him.

272
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,281
That's all I know.

273
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,902
You and I won't find much joy
while we're here.

274
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,696
But we can keep others alive.

275
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,871
We can defend those
who can't defend themselves.

276
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,964
"I am the shield
that guards the realms of men."

277
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,001
Maybe we don't need to understand
any more than that.

278
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,048
Maybe that's enough.

279
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,014
Aye.

280
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Maybe that's enough.

281
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,360
That's what I saw in the fire.

282
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,362
A mountain like an arrowhead.

283
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,737
Are you sure?

284
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,196
We're getting close.

285
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,081
Do you know what I like about you?

286
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,668
I honestly don't.

287
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,128
You're not a hero.

288
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh.

289
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,886
I've been heroic on occasion.

290
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,594
I once charged through the Mud Gate
of King's Landing and...

291
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,270
I don't want you to be a hero.

292
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,140
Heroes do stupid things, and they die.

293
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,107
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...

294
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,030
Jon Snow.

295
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,944
They all try to outdo each other.

296
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,117
Who can do the stupidest,
bravest thing.

297
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,779
It's interesting,
these heroes you name.

298
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,910
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...

299
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,835
Jon Snow.

300
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,164
They all fell in love with you.

301
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,875
Jon Snow's not in love with me.

302
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,456
Oh, my mistake.

303
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,132
I suppose he stares at you longingly

304
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,756
because he's hopeful
for a successful military alliance.

305
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,723
He's too little for me.

306
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,680
I didn't mean...

307
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,932
As heroes go, he is quite little.

308
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,226
I know you're brave.

309
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,225
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

310
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,402
So...

311
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,528
If all goes well,
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

312
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,864
From everything
you've told me about her,

313
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,950
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

314
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,621
Oh...

315
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,837
First she'd torture you
in some horrible way,

316
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,129
then she'd murder you.

317
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,963
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

318
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,670
But if we go to the capital,

319
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,632
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

320
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,886
Anyone touches you,

321
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,389
King's Landing burns down
to the foundation stones.

322
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,471
And right now she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

323
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,600
Of course she is.

324
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,023
And she's wondering what trap
you're laying for her.

325
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,475
Are we?

326
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,981
Laying any traps?

327
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,279
If we want to create
a new and better world,

328
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,203
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder
is the best way to start.

329
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,031
Which war was won
without deceit and mass murder?

330
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,578
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless
if you're going to win the throne.

331
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,709
You'll need to inspire
a degree of fear.

332
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,957
But fear is all Cersei has.

333
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,676
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

334
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,920
It makes their power brittle.

335
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,882
Because everyone beneath them
longs to see them dead.

336
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,135
Aegon Targaryen got
quite a long way on fear.

337
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,310
He did.

338
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,477
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

339
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,057
Aegon built a wheel.

340
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,505
If that's the kind of queen
you want to be,

341
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,529
how are you different

342
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,257
from all the other tyrants
that came before you?

343
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,648
So we walk into the lion's den.

344
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,489
My brother promised me he'd keep
a grip on the Lannister forces.

345
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,788
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

346
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Except yours.

347
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,378
And I promised him I'd keep you
from doing anything impulsive.

348
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,082
Impulsive?

349
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,008
This will be a difficult negotiation.

350
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,007
We are sitting down with people
who want to see us both headless.

351
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,139
My sister's likely to say
something provocative.

352
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,229
And?

353
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,977
And you have been known
to lose your temper from time to time.

354
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,399
As all great leaders do.

355
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,852
When have I lost my temper?

356
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,396
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

357
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,776
That was not impulsive.

358
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,526
That was necessary.

359
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,406
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

360
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,281
Perhaps the father needed to die,
and not the son.

361
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,038
Perhaps they both needed
time to contemplate their mistakes

362
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,368
in the solitude of a cold cell.

363
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,880
We had no time
to discuss the possibilities

364
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,798
before you ended their possibilities.

365
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,237
One could be forgiven for thinking

366
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,989
you're taking your family's side
in this debate.

367
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,005
I am taking their side.

368
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,135
You need to take your enemy's side

369
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,995
if you're going to see things
the way they do.

370
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,726
And you need to see things
the way they do

371
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,849
if you're going to anticipate
their actions,

372
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,101
respond effectively, and beat them.

373
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,476
Which I want you to do very much.

374
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,904
Because I believe in you
and in the world you want to build.

375
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,158
But the world you want to build
doesn't get built all at once.

376
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,236
Probably not in a single lifetime.

377
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,327
How do we ensure your vision endures?

378
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,205
After you break the wheel, how do
we make sure it stays broken?

379
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,916
You want to know who sits
on the Iron Throne after I'm dead.

380
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,170
Is that it?

381
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,799
You say you can't have children.

382
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,965
But there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

383
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,016
The Night's Watch has one method.

384
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,099
The Ironborn, for all
their many flaws, have another.

385
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,292
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

386
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,808
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows
fly towards you

387
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,379
when you fought
on the Blackwater Rush.

388
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,395
And I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

389
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,072
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended you.

390
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,558
You've been thinking about my death
quite a bit, haven't you?

391
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,530
Is this one of the items you discussed
with your brother in King's Landing?

392
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,910
I'm trying to serve you
by planning for the long term.

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,478
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

394
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,664
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

395
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,926
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

396
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,592
Look.

397
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,934
A bear.

398
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,061
Big

399
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,359
Do bears have blue eyes?

400
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,323
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

401
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,197
Flask.

402
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,301
Go on.

403
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,110
You all right?

404
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,201
I just got bit by a dead bear.

405
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,280
Aye. You did.

406
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,325
Funny old life.

407
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,628
Right then.

408
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,337
We're off.

409
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,405
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

410
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,278
She seems very resourceful.

411
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,408
You're worried.

412
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,043
We're asking 20,000 men
to fight with us

413
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,838
in the worst winter
any of them have ever seen.

414
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,792
The weather will be
the least of their problems.

415
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,816
I mean, many of them will be happy
to find a good reason to go home.

416
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,139
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

417
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,550
Jon is not here.
I haven't heard from him in weeks.

418
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,727
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

419
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,684
The King chose you
to rule in his absence.

420
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,229
And rule you have.

421
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,685
Wisely.

422
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,071
Ably.

423
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,731
They see that. They respect you.

424
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,695
Some may even prefer you.

425
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,744
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

426
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,932
then they named him their king

427
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,101
and now they're ready
to turn their backs on him again.

428
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,538
How far would you trust men like that?

429
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,584
They're all bloody wind vanes.

430
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,958
If they found out
that I wrote that letter,

431
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,541
a woman who's already married not one
but two enemies of her house,

432
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,550
by the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

433
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,471
Arya's not like them.

434
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,351
She's your sister.

435
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,017
You may have disagreements
but she would never betray her family.

436
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,816
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

437
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,102
Is that what she thinks?

438
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,687
I don't know what she thinks.

439
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,980
I don't know her anymore.

440
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,284
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

441
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,408
She's sworn to protect
both of Catelyn Stark's girls.

442
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,501
Is she not?

443
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,211
She is.

444
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,763
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

445
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,215
wouldn't she be honour bound
to intercede?

446
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,515
She would.

447
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,742
Something I've always wanted to know.

448
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,828
All right.

449
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,247
How drunk were you when you
charged through the breach on Pyke?

450
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,873
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

451
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,673
Some of the lads told me about it
the next morning.

452
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,590
- Sounded like a good scrap.
- Aye.

453
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,389
It was a proper scrap.

454
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,343
The Ironborn thought
you were some kind of god.

455
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,099
The way you were
waving that flaming sword.

456
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,982
I thought you were the bravest man
I ever saw.

457
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,227
Just the drunkest.

458
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,398
Where's the rest of them?

459
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,696
If we wait long enough,
we'll find out.

460
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,383
Run back to Eastwatch.
Get a raven to Daenerys,

461
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,477
tell her what's happened.

462
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,561
I'm not leaving you.

463
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,853
You're the fastest. Go! Now!

464
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,511
You're faster without the hammer.

465
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,728
Give it.

466
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,899
Give it!

467
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,405
Come on!

468
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,537
Come on!

469
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,912
Stop!

470
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,815
Go!

471
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,776
What happened?

472
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,311
Where are the others?

473
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,612
Raven...

474
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,447
We need to send a raven!

475
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,399
Get the maester! Now!

476
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,150
Thoros.

477
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,075
Thoros.

478
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,475
They say it's one
of the better ways to go.

479
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,983
Lord of Light,

480
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,068
show us the way.

481
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,573
Come to us in our darkness
and lead your servant into the light.

482
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,704
We have to burn his body.

483
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,422
We'll all be close behind him,

484
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,382
unless the Lord of Light is
kind enough to send us a bit of fire.

485
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,519
Lord of Light,
come to us in our darkness.

486
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,776
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

487
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,760
We'll all freeze soon,
and so will the water.

488
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,851
When you killed the White Walker,

489
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,314
almost all the dead
that followed it fell. Why?

490
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,570
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

491
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:35,822
We can go for the Walkers,
maybe we'll stand a chance.

492
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,915
No.

493
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,202
We need to take that thing
back with us.

494
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,794
There's a raven
flying for Dragonstone now.

495
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,261
Daenerys is our only chance.

496
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,339
No. There's another.

497
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,305
Kill him.

498
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,807
He turned them all.

499
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,727
You don't understand.

500
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:11,278
The Lord brought you back.
He brought me back.

501
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,108
No one else, just us.

502
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,821
Did he do it to watch us
freeze to death?

503
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,913
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

504
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,203
This is your last life.

505
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,289
I've been waiting for the end
for a long time.

506
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,879
Maybe the Lord brought me here
to find it.

507
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,882
Every lord I've ever met's
been

508
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,473
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

509
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:50,948
My lady.

510
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,501
My lady?

511
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,997
It's an invitation.

512
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,121
To King's Landing.

513
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,838
My lady,
you are the Lady of Winterfell.

514
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:16,932
I am.

515
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,009
And you will represent my interests
at this gathering as you see them.

516
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,813
They invited you. They want you there.

517
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:29,519
I will not set foot in King's Landing
while Cersei Lannister is queen.

518
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,196
They want another Stark prisoner,
they can come and take me.

519
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,649
Until then,
I'll remain where I belong.

520
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,452
I have work to do here.

521
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,372
It's not safe.

522
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,199
Well, Ser Jaime will be there.

523
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,933
You said
he treated you honourably before.

524
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,837
I'm not worried about me.

525
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,041
It's not safe
leaving you with Littlefinger.

526
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:55,628
I have many guards who'd
happily imprison him or behead him

527
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:56,963
whether or not you're here.

528
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,638
And you trust their loyalty?

529
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,180
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

530
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,355
Let me at least leave Podrick behind
to watch over you.

531
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,793
He has become a competent swordsman...

532
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:12,528
I do not need to be watched over
or minded or cared for.

533
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,902
I'm not a child. I'm the Lady
of Winterfell and I'm home.

534
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,867
This is the safest place for me.

535
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,871
My lady.

536
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,074
I swore an oath
to protect you and your sister.

537
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,334
If I abandon you...

538
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,105
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

539
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,870
and you won't be travelling
on summer roads.

540
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,883
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

541
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,512
Yes, my lady.

542
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:02,621
You can't.

543
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,476
The most important person in the world

544
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,038
can't fly off to
the most dangerous place in the world.

545
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,243
Who else can?

546
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,250
No one.
They knew the risks when they left.

547
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,900
You can't win the throne
if you're dead.

548
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,130
You can't break the wheel
if you're dead.

549
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,463
- So what would you have me do?
- Nothing.

550
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,423
Sometimes nothing
is the hardest thing to do.

551
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,979
If you die, we're all lost.

552
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,391
Everyone. Everything.

553
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,438
You told me to do nothing before
and I listened to you.

554
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,444
I'm not doing nothing again.

555
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,378
Dumb

556
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,856
Oh.

557
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,177
Fall back!

558
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,972
Fall back!

559
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,102
Come on!

560
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,672
Help me!

561
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,037
Jon!

562
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,023
Go!

563
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,525
Go now! Leave!

564
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,368
Uncle Benjen. How?

565
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,085
You ride for the pass.

566
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,705
- Come with me.
- There's no time.

567
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,048
Go!

568
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,915
We'll meet again, Clegane.

569
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,871
Hope not.

570
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,862
It's time to go, Your Grace.

571
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,369
A bit longer.

572
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,235
Open the gate!

573
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,002
Not what you're looking for?

574
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,265
I have hundreds of men here
at Winterfell, all loyal to me.

575
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,685
They're not here now.

576
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,689
What are these?

577
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,025
My faces.

578
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,402
- Where did you get them?
- In Braavos.

579
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,075
While I was training to be
a Faceless Man.

580
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,579
What does that mean?

581
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:14,168
Back in Braavos,
before I got my first face,

582
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,668
there was a game we used to play.
The Game of Faces.

583
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,048
It's simple.
I ask you a question about yourself,

584
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:26,347
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

585
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,800
If you fool me, you win.

586
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,303
If I catch a lie, you lose.

587
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,480
Let's play.

588
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,067
I don't want to play.

589
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,108
How do you feel about Jon being king?

590
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,252
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

591
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,035
Those faces, what are they?

592
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,579
You want to do the asking?

593
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,042
Are you sure?

594
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,438
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

595
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,064
for the last person
who asked me questions.

596
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,954
Tell me what they are.

597
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,303
We both wanted to be other people
when we were younger.

598
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,305
You wanted to be a queen.

599
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,268
To sit next to a handsome young king
on the Iron Throne.

600
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,395
I wanted to be a knight.

601
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:19,226
To pick up a sword like Father
and go off to battle.

602
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,026
Neither of us got to be
the other person, did we?

603
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,316
The world doesn't just let
girls decide

604
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,526
what they're going to be.

605
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,827
But I can now.
With the faces, I can choose.

606
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,205
I can become someone else.

607
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,005
Speak in their voice.

608
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,258
Live in their skin.

609
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,340
I could even become you.

610
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,351
I wonder what it would feel like

611
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,854
to wear those pretty dresses,

612
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,604
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

613
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,408
All I'd need to find out

614
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,612
is your face.

615
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,514
I'm sorry.

616
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,602
I'm so sorry.

617
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,318
I wish I could take it back.

618
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,655
I wish we'd never gone.

619
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,750
I don't.

620
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,086
If we hadn't gone,
I wouldn't have seen.

621
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,873
You have to see it to know.

622
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,218
Now I know.

623
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,511
The dragons are my children.

624
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,635
They're the only children
I'll ever have.

625
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,729
Do you understand?

626
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,022
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

627
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,575
And we'll do it together.

628
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,328
You have my word.

629
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,666
Thank you, Dany.

630
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,754
Dany?

631
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,673
Who was the last person
to call me that?

632
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,465
I'm not sure, was it my brother?

633
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,553
Mmm.

634
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,222
Not the company you want to keep.

635
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,429
All right.

636
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,938
Not "Dany."

637
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,810
How about "my queen"?

638
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,109
I'd bend the knee, but...

639
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,907
What about those
who swore allegiance to you?

640
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,997
They'll all come to see you
for what you are.

641
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,053
I hope I deserve it.

642
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:22,936
You do.

643
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,166
You should get some rest.
