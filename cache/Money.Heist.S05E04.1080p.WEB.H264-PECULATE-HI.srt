[Miguel] Don't shoot!

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla!
I'm a hostage!

485
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,025
[sniper] They're on the roof.
They're taking their masks off.

486
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,791
If anyone goes near
the destroyed roof, shoot.

487
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,833
[sniper] Copy. We'll cover the area.

488
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,583
The robot.
Go in through the front door now.

489
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,083
They can't hold back
the commandos and the hostages.

490
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>- </i>Now's our moment.

[Tokyo] Palermo, give the order.

510
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,166
Give the order now!

511
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,916
- Not yet. We almost got Helsinki out.
- [Tokyo] We don't have much time.

512
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,583
Once he's free, we'll be the bait
to lure them out of the trench.

513
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,916
Chuikov!

514
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,375
Don't get close to the hole
until I tell you to.

[hostages] Don't shoot!

UNKNOWN NUMBER

523
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,708
Sir. All units ready.

524
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,833
Give me a moment.

525
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,166
Who is this?

526
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,041
<i>Go ahead, Professor.</i>

527
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,750
First of all, don't even lift a finger

528
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,416
because I assure you, you don't want
anyone to hear this conversation.

529
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,041
<i>Tell me, Colonel,
do you do yoga or anything like that?</i>

530
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,125
Capoeira.

531
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,625
So <i>that's</i> how you got your flexibility.

532
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,625
Your flexibility to dodge problems,
to dodge regulations and responsibilities.

533
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,958
You must be an excellent lover
with such flexibility.

534
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,291
Actually, I am. But I'm starting
to get disgusted by this conversation.

535
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,375
- <i>Tell me what the fuck you want.</i>
- [typing]

536
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:49,708
Go ahead.

537
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:54,125
[Tamayo]<i> They didn't resuscitate anyone.
They killed him in cold blood.</i>

538
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,875
<i>The best thing that could happen is for
that man to die in the next ten minutes.</i>

539
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,875
<i>They gave us a gift. I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!</i>

540
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,583
<i>We'll shoot them in the back
even if they're on their knees!</i>

541
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,541
<i>But before we do,</i>

542
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,333
<i>I need everyone to believe
they're fucking murderers.</i>

543
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,416
What are you trying to do?

544
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,791
- [inhales] All I want is a fair war.
- That doesn't exist.

545
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,291
Tamayo, you sent
eight elite soldiers inside the bank.

546
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,333
I have ten robbers inside.
I think it's quite balanced.

547
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,333
<i>I don't wanna see any other movement.</i>

548
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,776
You actually think
you're gonna stop me with that recording?

549
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:32,208
Colonel, you started out this race
to save yourself without scruples

550
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,791
or ethics.

551
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:37,125
All I'm asking
is that you keep doing the same.

552
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,083
<i>Either you hold back the second attack,</i>

553
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,000
or I prove that it was you

554
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,541
<i>who fabricated false evidence
against Alicia Sierra,</i>

555
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,708
who ordered the money transactions
from reserved funds,

556
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:49,833
and on top of that,

557
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:53,250
I'll transfer ten million to a company
in the Dutch Antilles in your name.

558
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,708
And I assure you that operation
will link you directly to me.

559
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,416
[breathes deep]

560
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,416
Put a hold on the intervention.

561
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,333
That's not the order I was expecting.

562
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,333
You don't get calls from the president.

563
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,708
You're not held accountable
before the government, right?

564
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,833
Then I think you should
go get some fucking cookies

565
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,916
and let me give the orders around here.

566

- [Manila sobs]
- [hostages shouting]

00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,041
[Denver] What's wrong? Are you okay?

571
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,934
- I'm good.
- [Tokyo] What is it? What happened?

572
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,958
- Nothing happened. [pants]
- Are you okay?

573
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,041
This... This might be
a little too much for me,

574
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,791
but I'm okay, I'm all right.

575
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:07,083
I... I used to rob gas stations, man,
and now the whole army is after me.

576
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,833
Don't worry about it. We're together.

577
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,875
I know, don't worry about it.
We're together. It'll be fine.

578
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:12,875
Go, go, go, go!

579
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,958
[inhales and cries]

580
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,041
- [Denver] Hey.
- [shushes] Hey, hey, hey.

581
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,226
- [exhales]
- [Tokyo] Look at me.

582
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,541
Don't close your eyes, okay?
Just look at me. Just look at me.

583
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,541
- Tell me something.
- [cries] What?

584
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,625
Whatever you want.

585
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,500
- Why'd you come here?
- What? [sobs]

586
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:30,458
Well, because... Because the other heist
had just turned out so well.

587
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,291
But not this one. [laughs]

588
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,291
And I wanted to spend time
with this moron, but...

589
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,375
But from the moment
I got into the monastery,

590
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:42,125
I swear, right there I realized
that this was not gonna go well.

591
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,708
What do you mean?

[hostages clamor in background]

593

<i>like a perfect family, you know? </i>[cries]

595
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,583
And I felt so naive.

596
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,125
Why would you say that?

597
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,041
Because I've been in love
with him all my life. [laughs]

598
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:09,083
Stop messing around.
It's no time for jokes, okay?

599
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,916
It's not a joke, buddy. [laughs]

600
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,500
It's not a joke.
The thing is, since we're gonna die,

601
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,416
because this is getting ugly, you know?

602
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,041
- [Tokyo] Listen to me.
- No, telling you makes me feel calmer.

603
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,625
[Tokyo] No, you gotta listen.

- Nobody is dying, okay?
- Okay.

Yes, Professor.
