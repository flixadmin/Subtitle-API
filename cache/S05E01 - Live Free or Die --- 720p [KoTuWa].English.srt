1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,870
Here you go.

2
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,950
What happened there?

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,900
- It's my birthday.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,900
- Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,830
Birthday meals are free at Denny's.

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,830
All you gotta show is a valid ID.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm good. Thanks.

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,030
Really? Free meal. Free is good.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,990
Even if I was, like, rich,

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,990
free is always good.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Thank you.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,630
Okay.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,030
New Hampshire.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,030
You're a long way from home.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,430
How long a drive is that?

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,480
About 30 hours,

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,480
if all you stop for is gas.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,550
You headed to California?

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,220
No. Here.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,070
Okay.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,990
So, what's here?

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,350
Business.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,110
You know, I was in Boston once. Boston

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,110
and a little town called Swampscott...

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,750
...which is right outside of Boston.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,310
That's kind of near

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,310
New Hampshire, right?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,950
Yeah. More or less.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,950
Yeah, I was maybe 6,

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,950
so I don't really remember it.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,230
I want to say I liked it.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,230
They got this really big aquarium.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,550
Yeah. Great science museum there.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,550
Excuse me.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,710
- Hi.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,710
- Hi.

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,710
My name's Lucy. I'll be your server.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,540
I got your word this won't wind up

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,540
crossing the border?

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,190
It's never leaving town.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,150
Is there a manual? Instruction manual?

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,150
I pulled something off the Internet.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,070
It's in there.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,790
Well...

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,990
...good luck, I guess.

46
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,950
Happy birthday, Mr. Lambert.

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,070
Jesus, Walt, the news here....

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,070
Gus Fring is dead.

49
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,790
He was blown up along with some person

50
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,790
from some Mexican cartel...

51
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,920
...and the DEA has no idea

52
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,920
what to make of it.

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,430
Do you know about this?

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,470
Walt?

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,790
Walt, I need you to--

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,190
It's over. We're safe.

57
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,030
Was this you?

58
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,950
What happened?

59
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,430
I won.

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,550
Oh, God.

61
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,350
Dad.

62
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,190
- Dad.

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,190
- Hey.

64
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,630
Hey.

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,110
Serious-- You don't have the TV on?

66
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,110
Seriously?

67
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,550
No, sorry, I....

68
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,150
You didn't tell him about Mr. Fring?

69
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,110
- He knows.

70
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,110
- Welcome home.

71
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,710
Jesus, Dad, it's all they're talking about.

72
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,390
They haven't said it on TV yet...

73
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,710
...but Uncle Hank says he was

74
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,710
this major, major drug dealer.

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,230
I mean, like, holy shit.

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,750
Your uncle is safe, right?

77
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,750
How do they know that?

78
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,350
Uncle Hank was

79
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,350
after this guy all along.

80
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,790
He didn't tell us, but he was.

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,560
He even took me

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,560
to his restaurant one time...

83
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,510
...just, like, totally toying

84
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,510
with the guy...

85
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,510
...just like, "I got my eye on you."

86
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,510
Like that.

87
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,470
They figure Mr. Fring was the one

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,470
who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.

89
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,110
Just somebody got to him first.

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,710
Yeah, wow.

91
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,190
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.

92
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,560
She didn't want us to leave,

93
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,560
but Mom figured it was time.

94
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,510
There's still some agents over there,

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,510
but they figure it's over.

96
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,140
Like, when this hits the news...

97
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,780
...Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,870
- Yeah.

99
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,870
- I mean, even more so than before.

100
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,110
Seriously.

101
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,070
See-- See if it's on TV.

102
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,430
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

103
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,390
Just give me a couple minutes, huh?

104
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,150
--around the 24-yard-line.

105
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,150
They break huddle--

106
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,070
Hi.

107
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,550
Hi.

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,030
Hi, sweet pea.

109
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,830
Oh, Daddy missed you so much.

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,550
Yes, he did.

111
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,630
I know.

112
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,790
I missed you too.

113
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,120
Well, don't you think

114
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,120
I rate a "hello," at least?

115
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
Hello.

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,070
Hello to you too.

117
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,670
So are you gonna talk to me here?

118
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,310
Are you gonna....

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,750
You gonna show some kind of....

120
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,070
I don't know, some kind of mild relief

121
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,070
that I'm alive?

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,070
I am relieved, Walt.

123
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,590
And scared.

124
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,550
Scared?

125
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,000
Scared of what?

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,110
You.

127
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,070
Hey.

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,350
Hi.

129
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,750
Oh, shit.

130
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,430
Jesus, just say it already.

131
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,030
Tell me "I told you so."

132
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,030
Get it out of your system...

133
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,550
...before you need, like,

134
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,550
dialysis or something.

135
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,910
It's exactly like Boetticher's drawings.

136
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,670
Where were the two bodies?

137
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,230
Over by the freight elevator.

138
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,230
Over there.

139
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,190
- No idea who they were?

140
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,190
- No, not much left.

141
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,830
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn

142
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,830
thing when they get too hot...

143
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,630
...so they tell me.

144
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,870
Whoever torched it did it up right.

145
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,790
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

146
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,160
What do you figure that was?

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,100
I don't know,

148
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,100
some kind of lab equipment?

149
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,910
Maybe a camera?

150
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,110
Come on. Come on, you, be nice.

151
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,110
Be nice.

152
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,790
Come on. Hey. Hey!

153
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,790
You be nice. Just be nice.

154
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,790
Let Wendell in there.

155
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.

156
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah.

157
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,310
It's Gustavo.

158
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,510
He's dead.

159
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,150
Son of a bitch.

160
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,670
Son of a bitch.

161
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,710
- Hold up! Hold up!

162
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,710
- Get out of my way, kid.

163
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,630
- Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.

164
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,630
- I am done listening to this asshole talk.

165
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,350
Now get out of my way.

166
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,750
He's got something you need to hear,

167
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,750
all right?

168
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,190
What'd you do, Jesse?

169
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,190
Do you even know?

170
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,230
Do you even know what you've done?

171
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,910
- Yeah, he saved his own life--

172
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,910
- One more word.

173
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,990
Mike. Mike.

174
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,040
If you kill him, you're gonna

175
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,040
have to kill me. Come on.

176
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,070
Oh, Jesse.

177
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,550
Jesus.

178
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,870
What is it with you guys?

179
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,580
Honest to God.

180
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,100
May I?

181
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,160
Look, whatever differences

182
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,160
you and I have, they'll keep.

183
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,710
Right now we've got

184
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,710
bigger fish to fry.

185
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,830
- Bigger fish.

186
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,830
- The video cameras.

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
Gus kept cameras on us at the lab...

188
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,480
...at the laundry,

189
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,480
God only knows where else.

190
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,470
And of course, when I say "us,"

191
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,470
I'm including you.

192
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,270
Mike.

193
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,940
Mike, if he taped all that shit...

194
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
...us cooking, you picking up....

195
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,150
If Gus had a record of that

196
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,150
and the police get to it before we do....

197
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,470
You son of a bitch.

198
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,680
Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,

199
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,680
or a hard drive.

200
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,630
Where?

201
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,120
Where did he keep it?

202
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,350
He had a laptop in his office.

203
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,350
Kept it in the back of the restaurant.

204
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,790
It all fed straight to there.

205
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,510
What?

206
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,710
Keys, scumbag.

207
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,390
It's the universal symbol for keys.

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,630
Meter fraud.

209
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,630
And yes, yes, it's a big deal.

210
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,870
Guy rigs his meter so he's paying

211
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,870
2 cents less for first-class postage.

212
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,350
I'm here to tell you that the USPS

213
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,350
takes that very seriously.

214
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,590
It's money out of your pocket,

215
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,590
it's money out of my pocket.

216
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,950
I was hoping-- Now, look, sarge.

217
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,910
Do you think we could work together on

218
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,910
this thing? You folks have it over there?

219
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,470
Could you tell me that, at least?

220
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,670
Yeah.

221
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,350
Well, thanks for your help.

222
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,350
Inspector Clark-- Inspector Dave Clark,

223
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,350
like the Dave Clark Five?

224
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,830
Before your time.

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,550
Well, you feel free to call me

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,550
day or night at this number.

227
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,910
Yes, sir. No, you as well.

228
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,510
Thank you.

229
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,470
Oh, yeah.

230
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,110
We're boned.

231
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,510
Well....

232
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,430
You know how they say

233
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,430
"It's been a pleasure"?

234
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,190
It hasn't.

235
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,710
Are you gonna tell us

236
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,710
about the laptop?

237
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,550
- Where you going?

238
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,550
- I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.

239
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,710
And so should you.

240
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,710
It's just a matter of time.

241
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,190
Mike, where is the laptop?

242
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,230
What the hell difference does it make?

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,230
They got it. End of story.

244
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,710
A.P.D., Northwest Area Command

245
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,710
on Second.

246
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,950
They tagged it, they filed it...

247
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,000
...it's in the system,

248
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,000
and they locked it in their evidence room.

249
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,350
All right.

250
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,790
All right. So describe the building.

251
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Describe the....

252
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,510
How about I describe Fort Knox?

253
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,350
And what are you gonna do?

254
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,110
Are you gonna put on your black leotard

255
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,110
and go dangling on a clothesline?

256
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,110
It's a building full of cops.

257
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,110
What else do you need to know?

258
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,190
And why in the hell am I talking to you?

259
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,270
Mike, we gotta do something.

260
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,910
I am doing something.

261
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,750
He's good with this stuff, okay?

262
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,750
Just give him a chance.

263
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,590
Now, you look.

264
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,070
That laptop might as well

265
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,070
be on the moon.

266
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,320
They build these evidence rooms

267
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,320
like bank vaults because guess what...

268
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,350
...lunatics like you

269
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,350
wanna break into them.

270
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,150
But unlike a bank vault, this is a place

271
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,150
that is guarded 24 hours a day...

272
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,110
...by the police.

273
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,840
There's no way you're getting it

274
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,840
out of there.

275
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,230
Who said that we have to

276
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,230
get it out of there?

277
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,400
We just need to destroy what's on it.

278
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,190
Oh, so now you wanna

279
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,190
blow up a police station?

280
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,150
I don't believe I said that, no.

281
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,830
Nursing home full of old folks

282
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,830
just whet your appetite.

283
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,670
Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.

284
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,870
I never said anything

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,870
about killing anybody.

286
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,790
I am, however, considering

287
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,790
the possibility of a device.

288
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,420
- A device.

289
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,420
- Yes, a small device.

290
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,320
Say this device gets filed into evidence.

291
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,150
- Now it is inside that room.

292
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,150
- What about a magnet?

293
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,670
You wanna commit a whole other crime

294
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,670
just to get this bomb into evidence.

295
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,590
- Who said "bomb"? I said "a device."

296
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,590
- What about a magnet?

297
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,510
An incendiary device.

298
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,510
One quick fire is all it would take.

299
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,990
You don't think they have fire

300
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,990
suppression? I'm not talking sprinklers.

301
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,190
I'm talking about halon.

302
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,190
Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.

303
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,870
- A magnet, though, maybe like--

304
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,870
- A bomb then. We plant a bomb outside.

305
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,270
Oh, actually I knew a crew

306
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,270
out of Fort Worth...

307
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,940
...that tried to blow up an evidence room

308
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,940
from outside.

309
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,470
About all they did was take out

310
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,470
a couple of hedges.

311
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,270
You are probably talking about 2 feet

312
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,270
of reinforced concrete.

313
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
Or what about a magnet?

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,390
What magnet? What about it?

315
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,310
You know, just:

316
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,310
So, what do you think?

317
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,640
Expensive.

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,870
Leaving aside engineering...

319
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,600
...rigging some kind of

320
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,600
alternate power source...

321
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,910
...my primary sticking point is

322
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,910
I actually need the thing.

323
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,830
As you gentlemen can see,

324
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,830
it's paying the bills.

325
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,270
But I mean it's feasible, doable?

326
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,630
Hey, we're living in a time

327
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,630
of string theories and God particles.

328
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,630
Feasible, doable?

329
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,630
Yeah, sure, why not?

330
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,870
Expensive.

331
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,110
What would you put it in?

332
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,630
What about that? Does it run?

333
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,950
We can get it running.

334
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,150
What's the box made of?

335
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,390
Plywood and aluminium,

336
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,390
just what you need.

337
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,870
All right, so you wanna talk money?

338
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,270
Step into my office.

339
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,990
Hey, listen.

340
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,390
I don't actually have

341
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,390
any money right now.

342
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,190
My wife.... There's an IRS issue.

343
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,230
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could

344
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,230
spot me my share. I'll pay you back.

345
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,230
Yeah. Whatever.

346
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,110
Right.

347
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,870
You coming?

348
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,550
If you have any brains,

349
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,550
you'll take that money you saved...

350
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,230
...and you'll skip town.

351
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,230
Today. Right now.

352
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,590
You don't think this can work?

353
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,150
Is that a serious question?

354
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,110
Mike, this is a three-man job.

355
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,190
The only way I know it won't work for sure

356
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,190
is if we don't have you.

357
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,600
Come in.

358
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,790
Get in. Close the door.

359
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,400
What did we say

360
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,400
about you coming here?

361
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,280
Yeah, speaking of things

362
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,280
that tend to rile you up...

363
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,190
...the police, they may call.

364
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,350
Let me back up a little. Can I sit down?

365
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,350
I'm gonna sit down.

366
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,980
Okay, why are the police

367
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,980
gonna call?

368
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,070
May call you.

369
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,070
Distant, outside possibility.

370
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,350
But on the off chance,

371
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,350
I want you thinking one thought:

372
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,740
Hogan's Heroes.

373
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,550
Sergeant Schultz.

374
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,550
You remember Sergeant Schultz?

375
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,430
"I know nothing. I see nothing."

376
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,950
You remember how he--

377
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,950
I want you like that.

378
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,630
- Okay, Saul, why are the police--

379
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,630
- There was an incident with Beneke--

380
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,310
Oh, God.

381
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
- And it's--

382
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
- Oh, Jesus.

383
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
- What incident?

384
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
- An act of God.

385
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,630
There's no right. There's no wrong.

386
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,230
I mean, it just-- That's the best phrase.

387
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,470
It fits, but we got a problem.

388
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,350
Ted's dead.

389
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,310
Sorry?

390
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,590
Ted is dead?

391
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,150
No. No, no.

392
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,630
He just woke up.

393
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,990
Right-o, that should do her.

394
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,950
All right, watches off.

395
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,110
Necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets....

396
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,350
Gold. These are nonferrous.

397
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,510
Better hope.

398
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,150
What about that stuff you young guys

399
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,150
wear on the end of your pricks?

400
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,190
Speak now or forever sing soprano.

401
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,190
What's up with that, by the way?

402
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,320
Why would anybody wanna put a metal

403
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,320
ring through the end of their prick?

404
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,750
What are you looking at me for?

405
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,790
All right, guns, knives...

406
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,670
...tools, keys, plates in your head...

407
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,390
...artificial hips.

408
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,550
Check your pockets for me

409
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,550
one more time, please.

410
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,110
Oh, credit cards.

411
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,950
You want that plastic working

412
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,950
come Miller time.

413
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,870
You know, I can foresee

414
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,870
a lot of possible outcomes to this thing...

415
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,430
...and not a single one of them

416
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,430
involves Miller time.

417
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,150
P.M.A.

418
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,790
Positive mental attitude.

419
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,950
Okay, I think we're good to go.

420
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,350
All right, where do you

421
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,350
want me with this?

422
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,270
Start 40 feet out.

423
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,270
That's more than the length of the room.

424
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,270
- Who's doing the honours?

425
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,270
- Me.

426
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,070
Flip that switch, turns it on.

427
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,190
Twist this here.

428
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,190
That's your power control.

429
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,150
- All right.

430
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,150
- Everybody ready?

431
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,830
- Yeah.

432
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,830
- Okay.

433
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,910
Fire in the hole!

434
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,390
All right, you ready?

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,030
Fingers crossed it don't yank

436
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,030
the drive shaft through the floor.

437
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,470
Anything?

438
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,920
Nope. It's still working.

439
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,590
All right, start walking forward slowly.

440
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,630
Wait, wait, wait.

441
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,160
Yeah. That did it.

442
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,310
Yes.

443
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,480
Yeah, bitch!

444
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,990
Magnets!

445
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,390
How many batteries is this?

446
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,760
That there's 21, wired in series,

447
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,760
so 21 times 12.

448
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,320
Two hundred fifty-two volts.

449
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
Can you add 21 more,

450
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
wired in parallel?

451
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,990
Up the amperage?

452
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,700
Everything goes flying

453
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,700
in that evidence room...

454
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,750
...it's gonna make one hell of a noise,

455
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,750
and there goes your element of surprise.

456
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,670
Won't matter.

457
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,830
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

458
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,230
Excuse me.

459
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,590
Hi. Who are you looking for?

460
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,030
Ted Beneke. I'm a friend of his.

461
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,190
But if it's not a good time, I could--

462
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,590
No, no, no, this is fine.

463
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,590
I'm just finishing up. Come on in.

464
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,630
Hey, Ted.

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,590
I tell you, he's been a real champ.

466
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,110
His colour's better

467
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,110
and his blood pressure's up.

468
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,110
We are gonna have you

469
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,110
eating solid food in a day or two...

470
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,790
...I bet you money.

471
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,950
That's wonderful.

472
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,030
All right, I'm just down the hall.

473
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,470
Ted.

474
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,910
Can you hear me?

475
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,670
Yes.

476
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,950
Ted, I just....

477
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't even know--

478
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,030
Skyler.

479
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,350
I haven't said anything...

480
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,830
...to anyone.

481
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,910
I told them it was an accident.

482
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,470
I tripped...

483
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,310
...and fell. That is all they know.

484
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,070
Just....

485
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,950
I've-- I've got children.

486
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,070
Family.

487
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,630
I swear to you.

488
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,990
Please.

489
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,910
I just....

490
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,990
I...

491
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,790
...will never breathe...

492
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,950
...one word of this.

493
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,430
Good.

494
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,750
It should be about a quarter

495
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,750
of the way down on the left.

496
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,070
We'll do a loop and come around

497
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,070
the other side. Turn here.

498
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,230
Right up there.

499
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,510
That's the wall.

500
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,790
What the hell is this?

501
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,790
There's some big-ass hump in the way.

502
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,420
So? Just drive over it.

503
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,150
- All right.

504
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,150
- Come on, you can do it.

505
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,030
Take it easy. Take it easy.

506
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,830
You got it.

507
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,190
Cut it.

508
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,510
It's, like, 8 feet away. Is this cool?

509
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,510
Is this close enough?

510
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,750
It'll work.

511
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,430
- Mr. White, let's go.

512
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,430
- Hold on.

513
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,470
- Let's just go!

514
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,470
- Hang on.

515
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,990
Mr. White, let's get out of here.

516
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,270
Just one minute.

517
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,310
- Turn it off! Turn it off.

518
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,310
- I will.

519
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,500
Jacocks! Jacocks, you okay?

520
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,830
Outside! Outside!

521
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,750
Yeah, bitch!

522
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,870
- Shut up.

523
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,870
- Yeah.

524
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,390
And what exactly are you celebrating?

525
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,390
You left the truck behind.

526
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,750
- So what?

527
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,750
- "So what"?

528
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,590
So what if they find prints?

529
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,790
And what if they trace it back

530
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,790
to the wrecking yard?

531
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,590
They won't.

532
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,710
There's no prints, I made sure of that.

533
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,550
There's no paperwork on the truck,

534
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,550
the magnet or the batteries.

535
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,390
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

536
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,040
I made sure of that too.

537
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,030
Well, you got all the answers.

538
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,910
So you tell me, Answer Man,

539
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,910
did all that even work just now?

540
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,870
Yes. It worked.

541
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,350
And I'm supposed to take that on faith?

542
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,430
Yeah? And why?

543
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
How do we know?

544
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,150
Because I say so.

545
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,870
07-66-26432.

546
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,440
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

547
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,430
Roofing hammer.

548
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,350
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

549
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,430
1 1-58-73321.

550
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,110
Fring, Gustavo.

551
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,270
Samsung laptop computer.

552
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,350
Damaged. Glass screen

553
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,350
is broken and in pieces.

554
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,190
Bag still sealed.

555
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,070
1 1-58-73317.

556
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,430
Fring, Gustavo.

557
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,430
Framed photograph of two men.

558
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,670
Damaged.

559
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,670
The glass is broken...

560
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,990
...and photo has slipped

561
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,990
out of its frame.

562
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,630
Bag appears to be slightly punctured

563
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,630
by broken glass.

564
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,310
Check it out.

565
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,910
That's not on the manifest.

566
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,590
All right, so first off,

567
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,590
I'm not a marriage counsellor.

568
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,470
Nor do I take sides in this thing.

569
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,550
And, not taking sides, mind you...

570
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,950
...but you did put her in charge

571
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,950
of your money...

572
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,750
...which I advised against,

573
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,750
if you'll recall...

574
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,790
...all of which is not to be construed

575
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,790
as an "I told you so."

576
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,630
I'm just walking you through

577
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,630
my mental process, so to speak.

578
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,070
So she comes to me with a problem.

579
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,590
That she's been cooking Beneke's books,

580
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,590
he's in Dutch with the IRS...

581
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,070
...and once they audit,

582
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,070
it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.

583
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,230
To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt

584
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,230
in this discussion."

585
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,110
To which she says,

586
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,110
"No, let's cut Beneke a cheque...

587
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,550
...so's he can pay off the IRS."

588
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,270
Again, not taking sides,

589
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,270
but she really was trying to protect you.

590
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,270
A little feedback here might be nice.

591
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,470
"Let's involve Walt in this discussion."

592
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,630
Yeah, that's what I told her.

593
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,630
She said no.

594
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,030
And you didn't argue the point.

595
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,070
You didn't think to contact me.

596
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,280
You were a tad preoccupied at the time,

597
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,280
if you'll recall.

598
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,870
Okay. So you took it upon yourself...

599
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,750
...to give away $622,000

600
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,750
of my money...

601
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,630
...to a man who had been

602
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,630
sleeping with my wife.

603
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,510
She's my client, same as you.

604
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,550
Does this arrangement

605
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,550
get a little tricky at times?

606
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,790
Absolutely.

607
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,990
But I try my best, you know,

608
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,990
ethically, in my duty--

609
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,950
Ethically?

610
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,230
I'm sorry. I must be hearing things.

611
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,230
Did you actually just use

612
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,230
the word "ethically" in a sentence?

613
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,550
You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.

614
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,480
You're a two-bit bus-bench lawyer.

615
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
And you work for me.

616
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,470
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow

617
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,470
never had a client like you ask him...

618
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,350
...for something...

619
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,110
....like this.

620
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,590
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass

621
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,590
on the line for you.

622
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,150
Huell too.

623
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,750
He's got fingers like hot dogs.

624
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,750
He could've easily busted this in two...

625
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,830
...and killed everyone in the office.

626
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,830
But do I complain?

627
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
No. Beg, borrow or steal,

628
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
I'm your huckleberry.

629
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,110
I go the extra mile.

630
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,110
Only you never told me

631
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,110
that kid would wind up in the hospital.

632
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,190
You know--

633
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,670
Take that thing

634
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,670
and get the hell out of here.

635
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,190
You and me, we're done.

636
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,840
What are you...?

637
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,430
Come on. Hey.

638
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,270
Hey.

639
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,990
We're done when I say we're done.

640
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,510
Yes, you are. Yes.

641
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,750
Hey.

642
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,390
I heard what happened to Ted.

643
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,990
He's not gonna talk.

644
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,990
Yeah.

645
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,270
I forgive you.
