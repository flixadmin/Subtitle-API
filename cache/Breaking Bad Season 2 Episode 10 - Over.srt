2
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,936
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

3
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,771
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

4
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,029
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

5
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,946
Please. You've earned it.

6
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,869
Don't push it.

7
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,200
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

8
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,951
Mom wants to party.

9
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,836
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

10
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,376
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

11
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,465
Just family and a few friends.

12
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,927
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

13
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,473
Sounds good.

14
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,861
Oh, thank you.

15
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,702
Now...

16
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,780
...what are you supposed
to do today?

17
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,332
- Nothing.
- Excellent.

18
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,795
Brownie points for taking a nap.

19
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,430
Can you meet?

20
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,729
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

21
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,404
...kicked.

22
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,939
Signed... Signed off.

23
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,731
I was even checking the obits.

24
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,952
No such luck.

25
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,998
So where does it stand?

26
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,451
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

27
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,542
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

28
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,465
What's the upshot?

29
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,797
The upshot.

30
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:52,141
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

31
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,309
Damn.

32
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,897
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

33
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,484
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

34
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,325
In fact...

35
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,490
...the news is all good.

36
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,248
What do you mean, good?

37
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,879
You mean, like, "good" good?

38
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,172
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

39
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,919
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

40
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,345
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumors.

41
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,100
How significant?

42
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,472
Eighty percent.

43
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,849
Dude. No way.

44
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,151
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

45
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,361
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

46
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,529
That's awesome. Serious?

47
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,450
That's... That's great, man.

48
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,199
I mean, my aunt, she never...
I mean, you know, at your stage...

49
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,625
...I didn't think that could happen.

50
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,296
Yeah.

51
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,998
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

52
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,004
No. You must be so psyched.

53
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,053
Of course. I am.

54
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,638
Okay, now we...

55
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,059
I mean, what do we...?

56
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,227
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

57
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,564
So how do you want to...

58
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,816
...you know, proceed...

59
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,707
...in light of this kick-ass news?

60
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:44,087
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

61
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,290
Sell off what we have.

62
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,133
And then...

63
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,930
Well, then I guess...

64
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,768
...I'm done.

65
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,954
- Batter up.
- Everyone?

66
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,421
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

67
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:29,590
- ...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
- Somebody kill the music.

68
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,636
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

69
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:39,054
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

70
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,558
But then again...

71
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:46,315
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

72
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,690
We really do want to thank you.

73
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,323
These last few months have been...

74
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:00,656
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

75
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,330
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

76
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,663
- All right.
- Honey, I'm so proud of you.

77
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,546
We all are.

78
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,170
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

79
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,346
But it's true. It really is.

80
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,009
And for the first time
in a long time...

81
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,182
...we are so excited about the future.

82
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,812
Okay, anyway...

83
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,697
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

84
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,863
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

85
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,031
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

86
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,990
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

87
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,208
...for those of you
who don't know them, are...

88
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,163
Well, they're heroes.

89
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,295
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

90
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,297
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

91
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,056
And they did.

92
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,851
So...

93
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,055
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

94
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,979
- To Gretchen and Elliot.
- Cheers.

95
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,062
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

96
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,653
- Speech.
- Yes.

97
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,357
- Speech.
- Yeah, Dad.

98
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,945
Come on, Walt. Speech.

99
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,910
Well, it's...

100
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,663
It's kind of funny.

101
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:28,331
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

102
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,706
...I said to myself, you know:

103
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,164
"Why me?"

104
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,929
And then...

105
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,426
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

106
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,971
...I said the same thing.

107
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,778
Anyway.

108
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,992
Thank you for coming.

109
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,788
And enjoy.

110
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,627
- All right, cheers.
- Yeah.

111
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,165
Cheers.

112
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,588
Inspirational.

113
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,044
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

114
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,292
I'll tell you that much.

115
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,095
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

116
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,435
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

117
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,433
Yeah, but why a turtle?

118
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,317
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

119
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,933
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

120
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,814
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a...

121
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,523
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

122
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,864
Anyway...

123
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,829
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

124
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,331
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

125
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:56,254
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

126
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,839
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

127
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,712
Anyway.

128
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,757
Poetic.

129
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,971
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

130
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,095
I guess that's the word.

131
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,162
Go ahead.

132
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,707
Better not let your mom see.

133
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:56,063
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

134
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,398
- There's no worm in this, right?
- No, that would be mescal.

135
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,903
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

136
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,201
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

137
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,780
Had this firearm instructor
who was...

138
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,668
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

139
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,245
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

140
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,085
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

141
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,256
We were drinking mescal stupid.

142
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,591
But... Hey, hey.

143
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,761
Walt, what you doing there?

144
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,678
What does it look like I'm doing?

145
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,937
The kid's 16.

146
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,557
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

147
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,358
What are you looking at him for?

148
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,404
We're celebrating. Come on.

149
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,203
That's all right.

150
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,293
No.

151
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,145
Jesus.

152
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:24,853
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

153
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,240
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

154
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,822
Hey.

155
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,573
Bring the bottle back.

156
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,630
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

157
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,675
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

158
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,556
- It's all right.
- What are you waiting for?

159
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,966
Bring it back.

160
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,686
Why don't we just call it a day?

161
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,530
All right, pal?

162
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,242
- We good?
- The bottle.

163
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,362
Now.

164
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,672
What's going on?

165
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,508
Jesus.

166
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,974
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

167
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,848
Oh, my God.

168
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,060
Okay. Okay.

169
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,614
There you go. Okay. That's it.

170
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,115
Just get it out. That's okay.

171
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,537
This is your brain.

172
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,256
This is your brain on drugs.

173
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,143
You weren't supposed to wake up.

174
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,568
Ever or...?

175
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:34,401
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

176
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,118
You want me to go back to bed?

177
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,912
No, I guess that'd be kind of...

178
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,460
No.

179
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,590
Need some help?

180
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,709
No, I got it.

181
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,013
Just have a seat.

182
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,049
Is there any coffee?

183
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,473
Yeah, shit. One second.

184
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,644
Well, at least let me do that.

185
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,022
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

186
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,610
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

187
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,830
It's huevos rancheros.

188
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,953
- I can tell.
- Yeah?

189
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,001
- Fork.
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,225
There you go.

191
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,976
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

192
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,689
- Whatever that means.
- No.

193
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,362
I'm all yours.

194
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,771
Really?

195
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:39,321
Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.

196
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,867
Hi.

197
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,326
I just wanted to say that...

198
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,742
No.

199
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,792
We'll talk tonight...

200
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,792
...but I wanted to say that...

201
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,805
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

202
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,926
...but it wasn't me.

203
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,314
And I'm sorry.

204
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,312
Love you.

205
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,308
Oh, boy.

206
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,244
I just wanted to say that...

207
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,656
No.

208
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:13,580
We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...

209
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,172
Hey there.

210
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:19,296
- Wow, who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

211
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,963
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

212
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:29,185
They're actually... They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

213
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,305
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

214
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,399
Actually...

215
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,234
...Walt's got...

216
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:42,356
He's been battling cancer.

217
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,072
- Skyler...
- And last week we got good news.

218
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,416
- I'm so sorry.
- But we're really optimistic.

219
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,954
Great.

220
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,786
- Great. Good news is great.
- Yeah.

221
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,461
Yeah, it is. It really is.

222
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,131
Well...

223
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,218
...feel free to bring these any time.

224
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,975
Yeah.

225
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,401
Got some real beauts.

226
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,199
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

227
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,956
Yeah?

228
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,084
Then again, what about tankless?

229
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,420
Sure. We got them.

230
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,252
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

231
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,551
Set you back about 1200.

232
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,968
It's not an issue.

233
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,049
You want installation, right?

234
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,896
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.
- That's what I like to hear.

235
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,656
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

236
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,907
That's Hover Man.

237
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,996
He can surf, skate, glide...

238
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:21,755
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

239
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,458
That's cool. Great lines.

240
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,258
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

241
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,468
That's Kanga-man.

242
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,261
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

243
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,767
- And who's this in his pouch?
- His sidekick, Joey.

244
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,572
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

245
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,361
...fights crime.

246
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,530
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

247
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,156
You know that, right?

248
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,954
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

249
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,627
Yeah, yeah, I know.

250
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,292
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

251
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,794
He's a product of experimentation.

252
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,964
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

253
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:12,550
- And this is?
- It's Backwardo.

254
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,473
Wait, no. I actually...
I changed it to Rewindo.

255
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,764
Anyways, he goes backwards.

256
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,642
He can make everything
go in reverse.

257
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,899
Time and stuff? Like time traveling?

258
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,649
No, he just walks backwards.

259
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,648
He walks backwards?

260
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,035
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

261
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,618
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

262
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,749
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

263
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,245
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

264
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,123
Okay.

265
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,831
Yo, I was a kid...

266
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,593
...when I drew all these.

267
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,337
It was like four years ago.

268
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:54,307
- They all look like you.
- What?

269
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,349
It's you in all of these.

270
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,682
No.

271
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,899
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

272
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,268
Oh, shut up.

273
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,527
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

274
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,288
- Is that your door or mine?
- I don't know.

275
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,501
It sounds like mine.

276
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,719
- I gotta go.
- Where?

277
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,887
Hey, where?

278
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,061
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

279
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,034
Jane.

280
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,457
Jane.

281
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,225
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

282
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,684
Hi, honey.

283
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,854
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

284
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,196
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

285
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,613
Finally realized that
I wasn't the drum track?

286
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,365
- Exactly.
- Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

287
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,331
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

288
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,786
Sure. Yeah.

289
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:46,706
Hey, this your dad?

290
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,667
- Yes.
- Hello.

291
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,128
Hi.

292
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,051
This is the new tenant.

293
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,883
- Donald.
- Jesse.

294
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,556
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

295
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,309
- No.
- Dad, why don't you come in?

296
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,103
It was nice seeing you.

297
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,273
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

298
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,353
Hey, Dad.

299
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,515
- Hey, son. Are you home early?
- No.

300
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,360
Oh, man.

301
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,981
It was a good day?

302
00:26:56,617 --> 00:27:00,199
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

303
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,405
Yes. Yes, indeed.

304
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:06,122
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

305
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,710
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

306
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,000
- Hey, want to take her for a spin?
- Oh, yeah.

307
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,881
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

308
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:18,297
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

309
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,091
Okay.

310
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,059
Pilot in.

311
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,939
Ignition. Bingo.

312
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,725
Okay.

313
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:32,312
- Ready.
- All right. Let her rip.

314
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,403
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

315
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:44,614
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

316
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,239
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draft reducer...

317
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,915
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

318
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,204
Sounds really good, Dad.

319
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,589
And the energy savings. I mean...

320
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,923
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

321
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,923
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

322
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,760
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

323
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,478
Son...

324
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:12,104
- ...about yesterday...
- I'm sorry about the pool.

325
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:17,602
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

326
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,533
See, your...

327
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,324
Your old man embarrassed himself...

328
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:25,779
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

329
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:29,782
I have to say I feel very foolish.

330
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,502
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

331
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:40,050
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

332
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:44,129
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

333
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,637
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

334
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:54,519
I should have used
better judgment all around.

335
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,730
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

336
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,106
...and for that I'm very sorry.

337
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,575
But I kept up, right?

338
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,660
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

339
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,255
I have some tools to put away.

340
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,822
Hey.

341
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,196
Yo.

342
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,568
You want to catch a movie later?

343
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,451
Yo.

344
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,037
- What?
- What was that all about?

345
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,334
What?

346
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,958
Before. With your dad.

347
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,713
It wasn't about anything.

348
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,971
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

349
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,426
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

350
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,223
A favour?

351
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,139
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

352
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,063
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well.

353
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,611
- So, what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

354
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,157
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

355
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:10,905
- How's that?
- I mean...

356
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,201
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

357
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,449
I bought a filter.

358
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,041
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

359
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,295
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

360
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,967
So?

361
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,636
- So?
- You think I'm gonna be all like:

362
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,887
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

363
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,555
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

364
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,306
That's all you think you're doing?

365
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,139
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't.

366
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,646
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

367
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,478
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

368
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,105
- Us.
- Yeah.

369
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:50,322
You and me.

370
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,321
Who's you and me?

371
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,833
I'm out of here.

372
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,193
Oh, boy.

373
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,907
Dad?

374
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,702
Dad? Hello?

375
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,130
What? Oh, hey.

376
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,249
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

377
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,092
- Rot?
- Yeah. Here.

378
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,714
I'll show you. Here.

379
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:19,965
Take a look at that.

380
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,438
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

381
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,398
- It's wood.
- It's wood...

382
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,319
...that contains fruiting bodies.

383
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,228
Fruity what?

384
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,694
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

385
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,950
I don't really see anything.

386
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,614
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

387
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,451
Then you cut it all out.

388
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:48,079
You just cut it out and start fresh.

389
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,884
Well, better get to it.

390
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:55,176
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

391
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,845
Not if I can help it.

392
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,873
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

393
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,955
- Go home already.
- I will. I will.

394
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:36,709
Hey, can I just ask...

395
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,426
- ...the Keller account?
- The Keller account?

396
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:44,306
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

397
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,564
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

398
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:49,805
Oh, God.

399
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:53,228
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

400
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,731
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

401
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,941
...with these little companies.

402
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,743
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

403
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,241
Right.

404
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,953
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

405
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,122
Sky?

406
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,378
Skyler?

407
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,259
Jesus.

408
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,719
No, I'm fine.

409
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,019
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

410
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,057
I'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,614
What's wrong?

412
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,071
I guess it just...

413
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,283
...doesn't feel any different.

414
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,793
The good news?

415
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:03,133
I mean, nothing's really changed.

416
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,973
It's just postponed.

417
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,980
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

418
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,650
But lately, it just feels like...

419
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:22,240
More tunnel.

420
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,486
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,247
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

422
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,038
I don't know.

423
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,625
For me, it was the flu.

424
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,503
- What?
- My dad rallied at the end.

425
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,093
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

426
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,845
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

427
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,684
...we were over the moon.

428
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,145
And right then, I got sick.

429
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,353
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

430
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,439
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

431
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,526
- Great timing, huh?
- Yeah.

432
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,574
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

433
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,365
"Why now?"

434
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,416
Being that rock.

435
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,046
You know...

436
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,967
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

437
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,809
Yeah.

438
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,067
...causing the housing prices
to trend.

439
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:31,784
Foreclosures are being fueled
by a spike in...

440
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:39,003
The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.

441
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,961
With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...

442
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,630
...the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...

443
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,514
...spelling more pain
for the economy.

444
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,309
Yeah.

445
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,080
Are you going to work today?

446
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,629
Skyler, there's rot.

447
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,178
I'm going back.

448
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:11,485
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

449
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,946
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night.

450
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,368
Oh, damn.

451
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,332
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

452
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,790
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

453
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,413
Get organized. Storage containers
to meet every need...

454
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,199
...big or small, on Aisle 3.

455
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,085
Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.

456
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,311
Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.

457
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:28,689
Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?

458
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:31,522
Go to Aisle 10 to go green.

459
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,867
Get a manager
on Checkout 4, please.

460
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:41,200
Manager to Checkout 4.

461
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,796
Pest problems? No problem.

462
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:56,792
Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.

463
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,218
You're buying the wrong matches.

464
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,883
- What?
- Those matches.

465
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,345
They're the wrong kind.

466
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,719
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

467
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,812
...not the matches themselves.

468
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,725
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

469
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,907
More striker strips. You understand?

470
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,866
Those only have the one.

471
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,570
And don't buy everything
in one place.

472
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,035
Do it piecemeal.

473
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,701
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

474
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:35,174
Are you following me here?

475
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:43,424
You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.

476
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:46,180
We have everything you need
to do the job right.

477
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:52,852
- Thanks.
- Sure.

478
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,108
- Next.
- Hi. Here you go.

479
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,473
- You didn't buy my stuff?
- No, I didn't.

480
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,264
We don't have time for this.

481
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,985
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

482
00:45:56,798 --> 00:46:00,132
Stay out of my territory.
