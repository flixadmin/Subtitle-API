<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,335
You've got too much
wood in there.

3
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,172
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

4
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,216
It needs to breathe.

5
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,134
<i>Take off that big log.</i>

6
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,981
Huh.
You know your fires.

7
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,576
Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

8
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,453
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

9
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,165
And there were
servants, of course.

10
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,668
I knew you were highborn.

11
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,925
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

12
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,471
Buried treasure.

13
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,057
Thousands of years old.

14
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,642
I think.

15
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,770
What does it do?

16
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,399
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,818
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

18
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,070
( baby coos )

19
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,913
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

20
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,290
A few more days.

21
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,627
Is the Wall
as big as they say?

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,587
Bigger.

23
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,799
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

24
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,676
It's hidden in clouds.

25
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,221
You're playing with me.

26
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

27
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,603
all made of ice.

28
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,439
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

29
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,322
Castle Black
is nice enough.

30
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,784
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

31
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,452
day and night.

32
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,706
And Hobb makes
venison stew

33
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,458
with onions.

34
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,834
Very tasty.

35
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,255
Sometimes, one of
the brothers will sing.

36
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,800
Dareon sings best.

37
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,969
- Do you sing?
- No.

38
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,680
No, no, no.
Not very well.

39
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,434
Sing me a song.

40
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,980
Oh, all right.

41
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,148
Let's see.

42
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,900
( baby coos )

43
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,695

That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,194
I know how
to skin a rabbit.

54
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,780
Not by the looks of it.

55
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,715
You grow up
north of the Wall,

56
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,425
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

57
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,844
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

58
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,723
If I had a bow,
I could have shot
a dozen rabbits.

59
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,475
Well, I made
this bow myself.

60
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,268
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north
of the Wall.

61
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,395
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

62
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,522
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

63
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,066
I had someone else in mind.

64
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,567
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

65
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,070
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

66
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,822
Some of us are just
a little better.

67
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,908
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

68
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,743
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

69
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,953
Or don't they teach
you to say thank you
north of the Wall?

70
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,707
You've got
a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

71
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,751
- Bran: Stop it!
- Hodor.

72
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,337
You've been fighting
since you met.
Just stop it.

73
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,256
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

74
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,716
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,219
You've been nasty
to her every day.

76
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,595
Of course she's nasty back.

77
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,263
Me? It's my fault?

78
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,432
First time I met her,
she put a knife
to my throat.

79
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,643
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

80
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,563
We can't fight each other.

81
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,816
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

82
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,568
I want you both
to make peace.

83
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,913
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

84
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,415
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

85
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,796
You're a good
little hunter.

86
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,172
Thank you.

87
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,632
See?

88
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,425
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

89
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,844
Don't push me.

90
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,595
<i>( Jojen gasping )</i>

91
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,189
Shh.

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
I'm right here with you.

93
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,318
What's happening?

94
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,362
I'm right here with you.

95
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,532
What's wrong with him?

96
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,496
The visions
take their toll.

97
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,833
He's having one now?

98
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,230
I saw Jon Snow.

99
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
You saw him?

100
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,610
At Castle Black?

101
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,614
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

102
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,949
surrounded by enemies.

103
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,046
Used to be you couldn't
find a tree within
a mile of the Wall.

104
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,299
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

105
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,056
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

106
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,356
You ever climbed it before?

107
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,566
No.

108
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,486
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,244
You're afraid.

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,248
- Aren't you?
-<i> Aye.</i>

111
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,209
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

112
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,670
But I've waited
my whole life

113
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,463
to see the world
from up there.

114
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,971
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

115
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,475
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

116
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,352
You kill someone
for them?

117
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,479
Nah.

118
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,564
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

119
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,525
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

120
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,535
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

121
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,831
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

122
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,834
Can we not talk
about that here?

123
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,211
( mocking )
"Can we not talk
about that here?

124
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,297
I'm Jon Snow.

125
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,382
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

126
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,509
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

127
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,969
Did I seem scared
the other day?

128
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,637
You were trembling
like a leaf.

129
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,055
Only in the beginning.

130
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,682
( chuckles )

131
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,684
Only in the beginning.

132
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,605
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

133
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,567
And don't worry.

134
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,569
Your secret's safe
with me.

135
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,904
What secret?

136
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,408
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

137
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,370
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

138
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,498
You're loyal
and you're brave.

139
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,338
You didn't stop
being a crow

140
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,007
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

141
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,974
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

142
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,688
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

143
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,154
The Night's Watch
don't care if you
live or die.

144
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,657
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

145
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,326
We're just soldiers
in their armies

146
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,536
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

147
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,880
It's you and me

148
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,925
that matters
to me and you.

149
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,889
Don't ever betray me.

150
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,648
I won't.

151
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,901
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

152
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,070
and wear it
'round my neck.

153
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,917
Sink your metal deep

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,212
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

155
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,923
And if you fall,

156
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,675
don't scream.

157
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,303
You don't want that
to be the last thing
she remembers.

158
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,556
( laughs )

159
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,776
Arya:
<i>Joffrey.</i>

160
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,615
Cersei.

161
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,367
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

162
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,829
You're good.

163
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,003
You're not as good
as you think you are.

164
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,299
Face, tits, balls--

165
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,967
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

166
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,637
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

167
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,308
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

168
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,645
Show me your position.

169
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,983
Keep your elbow high.

170
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,903
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

171
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,282
You're holding.

172
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,867
Never hold.

173
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,786
- What?
- Your muscles tense up
when you hold.

174
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,080
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

175
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,707
and release.

176
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,626
Never hold.

177
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,711
But I have to aim.

178
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,338
Never aim.

179
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,797
Never aim?

180
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,676
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

181
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,929
Trust your eye.

182
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
There's someone out there.

183
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,997
That's about far enough.

184
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,504
We come as friends.

185
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,047
Anguy:<i> Begging</i>
<i>your pardon, m'lady,</i>

186
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,466
but we'll be
the judge of that.

187
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,136
Valar morghulis.

188
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,305
Thoros:
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

189
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,394
( speaking Valyrian )

190
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,969
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

191
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>Why are you here,</i>
<i>my lady?</i>

192
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,946
Forgive my manners.

193
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,532
I don't see many ladies
these days.

194
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,868
Lucky for the ladies.

195
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,066
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

196
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,151
Six.

197
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,906
( speaks Valyrian )

198
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,096
I've always been
a terrible priest.

199
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,016
Drank too much rum.

200
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,851
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

201
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,938
It's a terrible
thing to say,

202
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,983
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't
believe in our Lord.

203
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,239
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

204
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,034
<i>were stories we told</i>
<i>the children to make</i>
<i>them behave.</i>

205
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,664
So I wore the robes
and every now and then
I'd recite the prayers,

206
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,917
but it was just for show.

207
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,547
A spectacle
for the locals.

208
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,925
Until the Mountain
drove a lance through
this one's heart.

209
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,725
I knelt beside
his cold body

210
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,393
and said the old words.

211
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,146
Not because I believed
in them, but...

212
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,401
he was my friend

213
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,862
and he was dead.

214
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,406
And they were
the only words I knew.

215
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,494
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

216
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,331
Beric's eyes opened

217
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,084
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

218
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,671
Our god
is the one true god.

219
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,342
And all men
must serve Him.

220
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,436
You've been
to the other side.

221
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,439
The other side?

222
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,318
There is no other side.

223
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,197
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

224
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,953
He sent you to us
for a reason.

225
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,165
You have someone
He needs.

226
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,211
Anguy:
Bodkin point.

227
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,963
Penetrates plate
at 200 yards.

228
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,969
Can you make 'em?

229
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,263
Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.

230
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,682
Just need decent steel.

231
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,142
I'll get you the steel.

232
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,186
Man:
<i>Come on.</i>

233
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,439
Arya:
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

234
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,361
That's 'cause
you're a girl.

235
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,071
What does that have
to do with anything?

236
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,954
Forgive me, lad.

237
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,961
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

238
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,629
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

239
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,464
He wants to be one of you.

240
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,716
He wants to join
the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

241
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,969
We serve
the Lord of Light

242
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,137
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

243
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,682
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

244
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,066
You're not doing this
for your god.

245
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,651
You're doing it for gold.

246
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,820
We're doing it
for both, girl.

247
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,198
We can't defend the people
without weapons

248
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,409
and horses and food.

249
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,079
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food
without gold.

250
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,999
Gendry:
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

251
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,668
You told me
I could be one of you.

252
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,093
You are more
than they can ever be.

253
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,971
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

254
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,599
You will make kings
rise and fall.

255
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,572
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

256
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,829
I see a darkness in you.

257
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,417
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

258
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,461
brown eyes,

259
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,756
blue eyes,
green eyes.

260
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,842
Eyes you'll shut forever.

261
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,640
We will meet again.

262
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,686
-<i> ( horse neighs )</i>
<i>- ( wheels squeaking )</i>

263
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,406
( pickaxes clanging )

264
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,342
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

265
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,014
Look out!

266
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,104
You all right?

267
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,277
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

268
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,779
<i>( laughing )</i>

269
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,702
( horn blowing )

270
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,620
( gasps )

271
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,002
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

272
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,171
Wa--

273
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,967
Wa--? Wa--?

274
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,346
Water?

275
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,972
You want some water.

276
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,352
I wish I had
some for you.

277
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,273
( whimpering )

278
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,786
So let's play a game.

279
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,082
Which body part
do you need the least?

280
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,045
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

281
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,339
I'll tell you everything,
please.

282
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:07,010
But you've already
told me everything.

283
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,429
<i>Remember?</i>

284
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,224
Your daddy
was mean to you.

285
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,185
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

286
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,314
One good bit, though.

287
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,358
The Stark boys,

288
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,819
they're still alive.

289
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:29,282
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

290
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,911
You failed,
but I'm a better
hunter than you.

291
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,790
<i>Now...</i>

292
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,792
how about
your little finger?

293
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,627
You don't use that
for much, do you?

294
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,005
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

295
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,053
( groans )

296
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,601
You've been wondering
why you're here.

297
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,479
<i>Haven't you?</i>

298
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,981
<i>Where you are.</i>

299
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,066
Who I am.

300
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,027
Why I'm doing
this to you.

301
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,698
So guess.

302
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,741
<i>If you guess right,</i>

303
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,702
I'll tell you.

304
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,204
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

305
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,041
You win the game

306
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,169
if you can
figure out who I am

307
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,004
and why
I'm torturing you

308
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,673
and I win the game
if you beg me to cut
off your finger.

309
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,345
If I win,
you'll let me go?

310
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,642
If you think this has
a happy ending,

311
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,604
you haven't been
paying attention.

312
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,897
Please.

313
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,817
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

314
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,865
You first.

315
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,117
Where are we?

316
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,287
- The North.
- Too vague.

317
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,372
Deepwood Motte.

318
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,458
( laughing )

319
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,877
Terrible guess.

320
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,132
( crying out )

321
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,137
Now, where?

322
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,932
Last Hearth.

323
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,018
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

324
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,313
( screams )

325
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,273
Karhold!

326
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,074
Karhold?

327
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,620
How did you know that?

328
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,124
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

329
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,292
No.

330
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,878
It was just a guess.

331
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,882
Very good, Lord Theon.

332
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,803
And who am I?

333
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,014
Torrhen Karstark.

334
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,808
He's dead.

335
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,602
Strangled by
the Kingslayer.

336
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
He was your brother.

337
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,156
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

338
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,460
- You swore
to tell me if I--
- You're right.

339
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,715
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

340
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,718
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

341
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:38,805
That's why you're
torturing me.

342
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,767
Yes.

343
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,355
You win.

344
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,536
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

345
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,123
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

346
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,962
( screams )

347
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,506
I'm afraid I am.

348
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,258
( screaming )

349
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,803
Everything I told you
is a lie.

350
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,514
( screaming )

351
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,351
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

352
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,771
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

353
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,232
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

354
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,944
( screaming )

355
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,907
I win.

356
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,659
Robb:
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

357
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,162
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

358
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,998
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats
and bandits.

359
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,627
But when the King
of the North summons us,
we come.

360
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,962
Lothar:
<i>Our father has</i>
<i>instructed us to tell you</i>

361
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,757
that his alliance
with the North can continue

362
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,593
if his terms are met.

363
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,554
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

364
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,431
for your violation
of your sacred oath

365
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,974
to marry one
of his daughters.

366
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,769
Of course.
He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

367
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,188
As restitution
for this betrayal,

368
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,733
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

369
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,736
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

370
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,073
Harrenhal is not
in the North.

371
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,618
It is his
once the war is over

372
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,413
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

373
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,833
And there's
something else.

374
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,877
We will do whatever
we can to give Lord Frey
what he needs.

375
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,381
Not what, whom.

376
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,801
What?

377
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,766
( chuckles )
No.

378
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,102
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

379
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,104
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

380
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,064
How old is she?

381
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,357
19.

382
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,775
Could I see her first?

383
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,235
You want to count
her teeth?

384
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,904
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

385
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,781
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

386
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,783
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

387
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,452
or this alliance
is at an end.

388
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,288
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

389
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,291
Father is old.

390
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,251
It will put
his heart at peace

391
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,129
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

392
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,090
And his recent experience
has made him wary

393
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,967
<i>of long engagements.</i>

394
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,427
He has every right to be.

395
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,055
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

396
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,909
Why should I let
that old ferret choose
my bride for me?

397
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,078
At the very least,
I should be offered
the same choice you were.

398
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,872
I'm his liege lord.

399
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,124
Robb:
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

400
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,168
I didn't wound him.

401
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,377
My answer is no.

402
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,467
Listen to me

403
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,512
and listen
very carefully.
You--

404
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,181
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

405
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,517
No man can compel
another man to marry.

406
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,353
The laws of my fist
are about to compel
your teeth.

407
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,564
It's all right.
You heard him.

408
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,567
If you refuse,
our alliance with
the Freys is dead.

409
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,196
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters
since I was 12.

410
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,865
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

411
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,409
When I say no,
he will come back

412
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,245
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

413
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,247
You're willing to risk
our freedom

414
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,707
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

415
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,085
I have a war to fight.

416
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,212
We can't win it
without them.

417
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,922
I have no time to haggle.

418
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,216
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

419
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,053
You recall that
heroic engagement?

420
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,060
I had something
less permanent in mind.

421
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,437
I've won every battle,

422
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,314
but I'm losing this war.

423
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,403
If we don't do this
and do it now,

424
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,446
we're lost.

425
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,245
I'll marry her.

426
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,748
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

427
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,585
It's not fair or right.

428
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,336
I'll remember it.

429
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,094
Roose:
<i>I see my men have</i>
<i>finally found you</i>

430
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,138
<i>something appropriate</i>
<i>to wear.</i>

431
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,142
Brienne:
Yes. Most kind of them.

432
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,144
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

433
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,771
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

434
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,898
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

435
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,527
When King Robb
left Harrenhal, his mother
was his prisoner.

436
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,279
If she wasn't his mother,

437
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,364
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

438
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,874
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

439
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,126
You should.

440
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,587
But instead,
you're sitting here

441
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,214
watching me fail at dinner.

442
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,467
Why might that be?

443
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,427
Wars cost money.

444
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,346
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

445
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,057
We both know
who would pay the most.

446
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,143
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

447
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,811
if he found out
you had captured me

448
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,147
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

449
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,483
You're right.

450
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,362
Perhaps the safest thing
to do is to kill you both
and burn your bodies.

451
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,322
It would be,

452
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,492
if you honestly believed
my father would never
find out about it.

453
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,495
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

454
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,789
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

455
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,916
He'll make time for you.

456
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,962
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

457
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,465
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

458
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,094
as restitution
for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

459
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,722
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

460
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,141
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

461
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,776
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

462
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,198
You do understand
how suspicious that is
to ordinary people?

463
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,743
Very well.

464
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,870
My lady,

465
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,832
may our journey continue
without further incident.

466
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,500
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

467
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,420
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

468
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,047
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

469
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,341
I'm afraid I must insist.

470
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,885
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

471
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,221
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

472
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,850
about overplaying
your position.

473
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,064
- Olenna:<i> Impossible.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

474
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,567
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

475
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

476
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,239
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

477
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:57,118
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

478
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,121
and the mother
of the king.

479
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,414
Old.

480
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,499
Old?

481
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,502
Old.

482
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,172
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

483
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,424
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

484
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,094
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

485
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,056
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

486
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,600
but this is another
matter entirely.

487
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,895
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

488
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:30,693
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

489
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,487
The only thing
that might turn it

490
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,115
are details
of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

491
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,452
-<i> Do you deny them?</i>
<i>- Oh, not at all.</i>

492
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,329
A sword swallower
through and through.

493
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,289
And a boy
with his affliction

494
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,124
should be grateful
for the opportunity

495
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,085
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

496
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,296
and remove the stain
from his name.

497
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,466
Did you grow up
with boy cousins,
Lord Tywin?

498
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,593
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

499
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,345
squires, stable boys?

500
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,639
Of course.

501
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,934
And you never...

502
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,977
No.

503
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,063
Not once?

504
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,606
Not in any way?

505
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,566
Never.

506
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,569
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

507
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,696
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

508
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,490
at each other
beneath the sheets.

509
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,076
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

510
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,994
for unnatural behavior.

511
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,412
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

512
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,623
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

513
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,793
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

514
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,547
brothers and sisters--

515
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,300
where I come from,
that stain

516
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,678
would be very difficult
to wash out.

517
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,472
I will not breathe
further life

518
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,724
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

519
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,520
Lie or not,

520
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,731
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

521
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,234
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

522
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,278
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

523
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,281
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

524
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,449
I don't care
what people believe.

525
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,369
And neither do you.

526
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,831
( chuckles )
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

527
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,252
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

528
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,005
then Joffrey
is no king at all

529
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,342
and House Tyrell
is throwing its prized
flower into the dirt.

530
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,013
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

531
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:26,309
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

532
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,770
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

533
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,231
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

534
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,610
All right.

535
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,237
I'll remove it for you.

536
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,990
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

537
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,868
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

538
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,413
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

539
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,498
He will never marry.

540
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,334
- He will never
have children.
- Oh...

541
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,169
<i>The Tyrell name</i>
<i>will fade.</i>

542
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,963
And Highgarden will go
to the children

543
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,381
of Joffrey
and Margaery.

544
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,967
You would have
your grandson protected

545
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,761
by someone
who disgusts you?

546
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,431
I would have
my grandson protected
by a skilled warrior

547
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,768
who takes his vows
seriously.

548
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,520
So, shall I draw up
the order?

549
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,483
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

550
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,281
It's a rare enough thing--

551
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:26,369
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

552
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,083
- ( men shouting )
- ( wind howling )

553
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,149
( cracking )

554
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,043
( screaming )

555
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,673
No!

556
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,217
( screams )

557
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,469
( screaming )

558
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,556
- ( grunts )
- ( screaming )

559
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,062
( grunting, shouting )

560
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,902
We've gotta cut them loose!

561
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,988
No!

562
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,088
( grunts )

563
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,553
( grunts )

564
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,226
( screams )

565
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,231
- ( grunts )
- ( yelling )

566
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,901
( grunting )

567
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,660
Take my hand!

568
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,878
( panting )

569
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,281
Sansa:
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

570
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,993
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

571
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,416
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

572
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,467
I'm very happy about...

573
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,136
Uh, yes.

574
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,555
I-I am as well.

575
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,809
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

576
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,229
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

577
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,940
I've dreamed of
a large wedding since
I was quite young.

578
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,275
The guests,

579
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,319
the food,
the tournaments.

580
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,366
And the bride,
of course.

581
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,415
The most beautiful bride
in the world

582
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,958
in a beautiful
gown of gold

583
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,502
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

584
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,257
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

585
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,135
No. I had never
left Winterfell

586
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,221
before I came
to King's Landing.

587
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,723
But it sounds wonderful.

588
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,267
I can't wait to see it.

589
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,436
And to leave this place.

590
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,397
It's terrible,
isn't it?

591
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,319
The most terrible
place there is.

592
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,207
Tyrion:<i> I don't suppose</i>
<i>there's anything we</i>
<i>can do about this.</i>

593
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,459
We can have them
both killed.

594
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,213
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

595
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,132
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

596
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,218
Probably Sansa.

597
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,136
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

598
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,847
a deep and singular misery.

599
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,725
Father doesn't
discriminate.

600
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,561
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

601
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,605
On a boat you built.

602
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,733
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

603
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,361
I did what I did
to protect our family.

604
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,529
I'm your family.

605
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,324
A member of your family

606
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,410
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

607
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,455
Whether or not
you or Father

608
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,332
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

609
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,584
I do admit it.

610
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,379
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

611
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,548
Stannis would have
sacked the city before
Father got here.

612
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,885
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

613
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:39,098
Trying to have me
killed is an odd way
of saying thank you.

614
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,435
There are two people
in King's Landing

615
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,437
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

616
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,482
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

617
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:51,610
<i>to kill me</i>
<i>during the Battle</i>
<i>of the Blackwater?</i>

618
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,455
The impulse I understand.

619
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,668
He hates me
because I'm the only one

620
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,504
who tells him
what he really is.

621
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:18,012
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

622
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,888
But his stupidity?

623
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:24,018
He could have had me
poisoned and no one
would have known.

624
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,438
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

625
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,690
to murder
the Hand of the King

626
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,650
in full view
of his own army.

627
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,319
The boy's an idiot.

628
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,112
What do you
want me to say?

629
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,781
I want you
to tell me if my life
is still in danger.

630
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,491
Probably.

631
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,243
But not from Joffrey.

632
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,454
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

633
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,666
Seven kingdoms
united in fear

634
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,918
of Tywin Lannister.

635
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,171
Not the Tyrells.

636
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,381
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

637
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,758
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

638
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,593
the little
doe-eyed whore.

639
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,679
And so will his children
and their children.

640
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,890
History will be taken
from our hands.

641
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,644
You may escape,
at least.

642
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,396
Once Jaime gets back,

643
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,899
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

644
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,027
of sword through bowels.

645
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,071
When Jaime gets back, yes.

646
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,822
But when do we think
that's going to be?

647
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,449
He's out there somewhere.

648
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,372
Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.

649
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,627
Who's going to tell her?

650
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,339
Do you think
people will like it?

651
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,758
I don't think they
will even notice it.

652
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,344
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

653
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,389
Anyway, from what
I can tell,

654
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,432
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

655
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,309
to the ones
in King's Landing.

656
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,270
They'd never make me
anything as dull as this
for my wedding.

657
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,316
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

658
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm sure he does.

659
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,571
Will they let me
invite my family?

660
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,241
They haven't asked
my opinion.

661
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,618
But do you think
they will?

662
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,203
No.

663
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,753
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

664
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,589
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon,
my lady.

665
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,050
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

666
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,803
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

667
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,767
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

668
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,186
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

669
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,438
Of course.

670
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,982
Alone, if I may.

671
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,192
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

672
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,819
Shae.

673
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.

674
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,364
<i>She's not from here.</i>

675
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,615
But I trust her,

676
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,492
even though
she tells me not to.

677
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,956
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

678
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,084
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

679
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,171
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

680
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,465
under entirely
different circumstances.

681
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,258
It's all right, really.

682
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,972
How to begin?

683
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,269
It's-- this--

684
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,522
this-- this is awkward.

685
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,860
1,000 blades

686
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,613
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

687
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,617
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

688
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,328
There aren't
1,000 blades.

689
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,872
There aren't even 200.

690
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,499
I've counted.

691
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,834
Ha, I'm sure you have.

692
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,754
Ugly old thing.

693
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,924
Yet it has
a certain appeal.

694
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,009
The Lysa Arryn
of chairs.

695
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,304
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

696
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,181
Early days, my friend.

697
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,142
It is flattering,
really...

698
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,522
you feeling such dread

699
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,857
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

700
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,902
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

701
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,695
I promise you.

702
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,990
Although who doesn't
like to see their friends
fail now and then?

703
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,242
You're so right.

704
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,369
For instance,

705
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,995
when I thwarted
your plan

706
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,872
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

707
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,333
If I'm going
to be honest,

708
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,293
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

709
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,380
of enjoyment there.

710
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,258
But your confidant,

711
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,719
the one who
fed you information
about my plans,

712
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,639
the one you swore
to protect...

713
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,560
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

714
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,147
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

715
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,401
She was a bad
investment on my part.

716
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,239
Luckily, I have a friend

717
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,408
who wanted to try
something new.

718
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:53,120
Something daring.

719
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,707
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

720
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,294
this fresh experience.

721
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,925
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

722
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,595
The realm?

723
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,347
Do you know
what the realm is?

724
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,935
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

725
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:22,316
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

726
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,943
till we forget
that it's a lie.

727
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:29,364
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

728
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,408
Chaos.

729
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,202
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

730
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,623
Chaos isn't a pit.

731
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,625
Chaos is a ladder.

732
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,171
<i>Many who try</i>
<i>to climb it fail</i>

733
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,715
<i>and never get</i>
<i>to try again.</i>

734
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,552
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

735
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,731
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

736
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,233
<i>but they refuse.</i>

737
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,570
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

738
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,656
<i>or the gods</i>

739
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,116
<i>or love.</i>

740
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,369
<i>Illusions.</i>

741
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,664
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

742
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,668
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>

743
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,670
( wind howling )

744
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,923
( panting )

745
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,940
( grunts )

746
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,961
( screeching )

747
00:52:02,661 --> 00:53:21,281
<i>( music playing )</i>
