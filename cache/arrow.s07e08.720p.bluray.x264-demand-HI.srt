163

just like we don't
do that anymore.

Dinah's right.

I'm very much enjoying not
being in prison.

166

to help the city,

it's the best one in town.

with her now?

Actually, we should all
really be thanking Laurel.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,536
I mean, she is the one
who did the trade

180
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
to get Oliver out of prison.

181

I'm very grateful.

always given you

the benefit
of the doubt, so...

really Felicity

who was willing to do
anything to stop Diaz.

this evening's honoree,

I used to believe
that justice was

197
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,518
as simple as putting
criminals behind bars...

198
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,434
But then I spent
some time in prison,

199
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,672
and I realized that
the truth is

200
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,399
nowhere near
that black and white.

201
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,079
The truth is that
our institutions have

202
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,435
a long way to go

203
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
before they achieve
true justice.

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,956
The attack perpetrated by
the Green Arrow this evening

209
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,713
is further proof
why we, as a city,

210
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,355
cannot trust men
that hide behind masks.

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,672
There is a reason why the
anti-vigilante law exists.

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,989
Thank you.

how this looks,

214
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,112
but this wasn't
the new Green Arrow.

215
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,554
He hasn't murdered
anyone.

216
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
That
you know of.

217
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,896
Has anyone actually seen
who's behind the mask?

218
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,389
Well, no. But whoever it is
has been helping the city.

219
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
And helped us
take down Diaz.

220
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,111
This was
cold-blooded murder.

221
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,510
Now, I appreciate how
all of you feel as though

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,239
the new Green Arrow
is an ally,

223
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
but I would like to be sure.

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,995
And how are you
gonna do that

225
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,793
if you're a no-go
on the Arrow?

226
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,872
Is there a law against
me consulting?

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,296
You mean an investigative consultant,
like <i>The Mentalist?</i>

228
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,356
I love that show.

229
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,318
I can't think of
a better way to investigate

230
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,056
a copycat Green Arrow than
with the original.

231

because I'm not
sitting this one out.

so go home.

compiled on the vigilante...

It's all there.

It says here
the SCPD

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,056
nearly arrested him
last month.

243
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,514
But he had
an accomplice?

244

Uh, yeah, that...
that was me.

I, uh,

246
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,432
I didn't want Dinah
to lock him up.

247

Oh, I bet she really
appreciated that.

248

She threw my ass in jail.

I'm really sad
I missed that.

What else do we
know?

251
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,920
Rene: Uh, he's definitely
not a rookie. I know that.

252
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,839
I mean, the guy's efficient,
disciplined, precise.

253
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,096
I mean,
he works the bow and Arrow

254
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,839
about as well as you do.

255
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
That takes

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,832
a very specific
type of training.

already suspect.

Oliver: Well, they're both
handmade.

265
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,154
The materials in the Arrowhead
seem to match.

266
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,799
This would be difficult
to replicate.

267
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,872
But not impossible,
right?

268
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,679

footage?

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,275
Yeah, but you're
not gonna find much.

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,680
The killer was
off-camera.

271
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,399
His Arrows weren't.

272
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,256
If this guy is as precise
with a bow and Arrow

273
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,715
as Rene says, then he
would've had a target.

274
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,753
Based on trajectory,
that guy.

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,956
Oh, wait a minute. That's...
that's Clayton Ford.

He's a rich dude who
actually helped The Glades.

277
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,155
He funded a clinic.

278
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,435
This makes no sense.

the motive?

directly.

innocent. So we'll be fine.

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,956
Why not?

482
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,311
We can toast your new club.

483
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,110
Hey. Toast to your new prison-and
Green Arrow-free life.

484
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,277
It's really got to piss
you off, though, huh?

485
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,511
Seeing some lame copycat
screw up

486
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,478
everything you
sacrificed for.

487
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,074
I wanted to speak with you
about that.

488
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,391
The last two murders weren't
connected to the vigilante.

489
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,918
So the rumors are true.

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,231
You are helping the cops
investigate this.

491
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,913
How can I help?

492
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,992
You were a member of
the scroll and key

493
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,116
back at Yale.

494
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
Allegedly.

495
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,320
It is a secret society.

496
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,595
Fair point.

497
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
How well did you
know Clayton Ford

498
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,269
and Sam Hutchinson?

499
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,556
Clay and hutch.

500
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Well enough to mourn them.

501
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Mm-hmm.

502
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,873
But we'd sort of fallen
out of touch.

503
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,776
Ford looked like he was
trying to skip town

504
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,359
before he died,

505
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,715
like he knew the hit
was coming,

506
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,593
but we just... we
don't know how.

507
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,239
You're looking for
skeletons.

508
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
And are we gonna
find any?

509
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,816
I know you're not supposed
to talk ill of the dead

510
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,958
or whatever, but, you know,
there were always rumors

511
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,816
that they had shady
business dealings going on

512
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,912
with the triad, I believe.

513
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,277
So who knows? Maybe they got
in over their heads.

514
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,437
Probably.

515
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,113
I won't take up any
more of your time.

516
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,230
Thank you, Max.

517
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,436
You mind if I ask you
a question?

518
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,752
They sent you to prison
for helping this city.

519
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,154
Why the hell should you
care about any of this?

520
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,719
Old habits.

521
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,195
I guess some people don't
change that much after all.

522
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,237
[Chuckles softly]

523
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,795
Hey.

524
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,749
Sorry I'm late.

525
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,479
That's OK.

526
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,439
I'm still getting used to
you coming home at all.

527
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,591
How did things go
with Fuller?

528
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,319
Max Fuller is
hiding something.

529
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,039
Do you mind looking
into it?

530
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,998
Of course.

531
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,918
Hey, you just came in
the front door,

532
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,469
and none of my security
measures triggered.

533
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,630
You sure?

534
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,552
[Typing]

535
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,874
Felicity!

536
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,359
Who are you?

537
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,274
My husband asked you
a question.

538
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,589
Where'd you get that?

539
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,558
We'll talk about it later.

540
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,233
Stay down!

541
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,674
Hey, hey.

542
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,776
Dinah: All right. As soon
as the doc gives the OK,

543
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,536
we'll take him into
the station for questioning.

544
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,553
In the meantime, we'll go through his
effects, see what we can find out.

545
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,915
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

546
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,719
Oh, hey, and just
a bit of advice.

547
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Yeah.

548
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,720
You probably shouldn't be shooting
people your first week out of prison.

549
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,956
- That's a good tip.
- Yeah.

550
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,552
He must've somehow
countered my alarm

551
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,016
by sonically hacking
into the sensors.

552
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Felicity.

553
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
That is a design flaw that
could take weeks to fix.

554
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,396
- We need to talk about this.
- No. We need to be safe.

555
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,256
This security system was
supposed to bring peace of mind.

556
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,033
- You mean like owning a gun?
- Yeah.

557
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,553
Where'd you even get a gun?

558
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,160
Your best new friend
Laurel?

559
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,993
Of course not.

560
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,833
I got it from your
ex-best friend, Anatoly.

561
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,196
You what?

562
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,476
I've barely been gone
7 months,

563
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,710
and you've aligned yourself

564
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,792
with two of the most immoral
people we know?

565
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,599
Oliver, you don't
get to judge me.

566
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,056
You just shot a man in
our living room.

567
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,912
Something you've done
a million times.

568
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,559
Hey, this isn't you.

569
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,519
You don't obsess over
security.

570
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,557
You certainly
don't carry a gun.

571
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,199
This is me, Oliver,

572
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,896
not because I was influenced
by Laurel or Anatoly.

573
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,559
This is me
because of you.

574
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,472
You were the one
that decided

575
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,841
all on your own that you were
going to sacrifice yourself,

576
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,872
leaving your son
and your wife

577
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,077
alone at home as
sitting ducks for Diaz.

578
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,000
And the best part about
the whole thing is that

579
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,000
you didn't even ask us
about how we felt about it.

580
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
I've already apologized
for this.

581
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't know how many times
you need me to apologize.

582
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,800
What am I supposed to do
with an apology, Oliver?

583
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,678
I'm just supposed
to move on?

584
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
While you were gone,

585
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,112
I had to figure out
how to survive.

586
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,838
And I am glad that
I did

587
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,913
because the old me,
she was weak.

588
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,037
How could you possibly
think that?

589
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,995
The old you was the person
I fell in love with.

590
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,034
Well...

591
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,754
She's gone.

592
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,351
And she's not
coming back.

593
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,558
[Laughter in distance]

594
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,479
I thought you didn't drink.

595
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,994
Yeah, well, it's been
a tough week.

596
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,399
I know the feeling.

597
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,755
You know, Roy told me

598
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,274
this would only
bring me pain,

599
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,399
and he was right.

600
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,392
[Chuckles softly]

601
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,519
I'm going home.

602
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,752
Just like that, huh,
without any answers?

603
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,990
Felicity is dead.

604
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,390
And before that,
she had a plan to blow up an entire city.

605
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,437
So I'm not sure exactly
why I'm supposed to care

606
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,438
about what happened
to her.

607
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,038
I'm just sorry I dragged
you all into this.

608
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,072
You need to see something.

609
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,032
It's called
the mark of four.

610
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,873
Your dad came up with it.

611
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,869
I don't remember that.

612
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,360
You were already gone.

613
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,478
It was right before
everything.

614
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,996
It symbolizes the 4 pillars
of heroism...

615
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,919
courage, compassion,
selflessness, and loyalty.

616
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,193
We all got them as
a reminder that

617
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,751
no matter what happened,
if one of us was in trouble,

618
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,400
the other ones would
be there.

619
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,191
That's why Roy came with
you back to Star City.

620
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,998
He saw the symbol written on the
inside of your father's bow.

621
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,035
So that's why you're
helping us?

622
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,831
I didn't know what to
make of you at first.

623
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,115
[Scoffs]

624
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,389
Trust doesn't come
so easily to me.

625
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah? So what changed?

626
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,876
I started seeing the best
parts of your dad in you...

627
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,077
the strength that
made him a hero.

628
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,350
I am not that.

629
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,238
You sure about that?

630
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,236
'Cause your dad,
he had this way of looking into things,

631
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,391
of seeing beyond
the evidence.

632
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,158
So what does your gut
tell you about Blackstar?

633
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,792
That she isn't telling
us the whole story.

634
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,193
Good. Let's find out
what she's hiding.

635
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,073
Hey, hey.
Who's hungry?

636
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,516
Ohh. You're a life saver.

637
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,831
It's not often I get to buy
the police captain dinner.

638
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Yeah?

639
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,997
Well, you'd better get
your fill in now

640
