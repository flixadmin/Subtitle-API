1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,170
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,211
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S. T.A.R. Labs</i>

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,047
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,348
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,177
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,559
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,107
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,310
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,979
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,656
The Quark Sphere, filled with
Barry's unique genetic marker,

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,483
and programmed to track his specific DNA

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,364
using the electrical current
of the Speed Force.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,411
Once we track Barry
and we pull him out,

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,740
the Quark Sphere will trick
the Speed Force

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,823
into thinking he's still there.

17
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:43,999
What's happening?

18
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,999
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

19
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,126
- Flash?
- Flash.

20
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,707
I'm your father's doppelganger.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,090
- Jesse, you're a speedster.
<i>- Yeah. It's pretty cool, right?</i>

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,466
- Everything okay with Jesse?
- Yes.

23
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,391
I just spent the summer
assembling a support staff for her,

24
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,433
but then Jesse goes
and kicks me off the team.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,977
They took a vote, I'm out.

26
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,599
I don't even have
a home to return to now.

27
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,671
- Oh, Barry. What...
- Iris.

28
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,015
- I'm...
- You're moving with me, okay.

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,512
- What?
- You're moving as fast as I am,

30
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,844
like in the courtroom.

31
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,927
Why? Didn't you...

32
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,482
- I can't. I can't.
- What's wrong? What?

33
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,478
I can't save us this time.

34
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,662
Ready when you are, Barry.

35
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,964
<i>- I'm ready.</i>
- Are you serious?

36
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,337
Come on, Cisco, just one more.

37
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,884
"She said, two hours ago."

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,587
Look, you know he's not gonna stop
until he makes it through.

39
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,631
Come on. You know how Barry gets.

40
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,224
- One more.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,427
All right. Here we go.

42
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:35,608
Three, two, one. Now!

43
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,653
- Damn it! One more.
- Iris.

44
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,405
Uh, Barry. Look, why don't we take five?

45
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,278
No. Not until I get this. All right?
Come on.

46
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,533
- Listen, Miyagi.
- What?

47
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,660
I've been here all day
opening breaches, all right?

48
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,707
So unless you wanna
rub your hands together

49
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,001
and do some magic shoulder pop...

50
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,579
- I'm not rubbing your shoulder.
- That's what I thought. I'm taking five.

51
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,835
- Hey, come on.
- I'm taking five!

52
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,961
I don't understand
why I can't get this.

53
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,468
Well, probably because
you've been up all night.

54
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,638
But that shouldn't matter.

55
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,138
Look, Barry.
A breach closes in three picoseconds.

56
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,595
DeVoe's could shut even faster.

57
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,979
Look, I'm just saying that this
might not even be

58
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,648
the best plan to catch him anyway.

59
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,724
It's a plan, you know.

60
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,855
It's the only one we have, right now.

61
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,186
And what if he uses his force field
against you?

62
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,480
You don't know how to get out of it yet.

63
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,610
I don't know, Iris, but, I mean,
we need something.

64
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,281
We have no leads
on the next three bus metas.

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,203
No way to track DeVoe.
No way to stop him.

66
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,871
I mean, he can't be this smart.

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,168
I'm sorry, but, I mean,
we've been at this for months,

68
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,586
and we have nothing.

69
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,747
I mean, maybe that's the problem.

70
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,043
You know,
sometimes you have to take a breather

71
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,924
and let the answer come to you.
Do something else for a bit.

72
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,254
Like what?

73
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,058
Like date night, for starters?

74
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,897
You know,
we haven't had any quality time,

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,522
just you and me, since our honeymoon.

76
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,193
Which was severely cut short.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,359
- I know we're the Flash, but...
- We're also Barry and Iris.

78
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,369
No, you're right.

79
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,785
All right. I'm gonna make
a reservation, tonight.

80
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,413
Someplace very romantic.

81
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,539
Mmm.

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,666
Sounds perfect.

83
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,917
How is it we live together,
work together,

84
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,424
sleep in the same bed together,
but it still feels like

85
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,005
we don't spend any real time
as husband and wife?

86
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,093
<i>Allen. West-Allen.
Cortex, now!</i>

87
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,682
I have no idea.

88
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,645
Let's go.

89
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,733
What is this?

90
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,490
This is a signature field
mapping every time

91
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,448
DeVoe's gone in and out of his lair
in a pocket dimension.

92
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,533
- All of these?
- All of them.

93
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,868
So, how did you do this?

94
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,623
I didn't do it, actually. Ramon did.

95
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,423
But all I did was just come up with
a really complex and eloquent algorithm

96
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,545
to track the warping signatures...

97
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,625
Don't do that, all right? Don't do that.

98
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,176
Don't be modest, all right?
It's unbecoming.

99
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,798
- You're unbecoming.
- You wish I was unbecoming.

100
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,050
Do you know that these are DeVoe?

101
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,472
These are DeVoe, all right?

102
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,424
This is when Marlize
grabbed him from Izzy at Lawrence Hills.

103
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,976
This is when he showed up
at Iron Heights Prison...

104
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,269
This is DeVoe's house.

105
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,891
And this is the alleyway
in the city center

106
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,971
where he abducted you.

107
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,275
- How long has this been going on?
- Wait for it.

108
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,444
- The past three years.
- Three years?

109
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,113
DeVoe orchestrated everything
to get the people he wanted on the bus.

110
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,031
He's been planning this a long time.

111
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,325
We've got a planner, just like Thawne.

112
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,365
Just like Thawne.

113
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,536
So, how do we use this?

114
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,034
All we can do right now

115
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,331
is just wait for the next marker
to appear.

116
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,407
Try to get the jump on him.

117
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,119
That, and keep an eye on Ralph,
using the old buddy system.

118
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,374
Has anyone seen Ralph today?

119
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,502
No, he's downstairs moving in.
He's very nervous.

120
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,049
- I don't know why.
- I don't know why either.

121
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,296
He's a superhero.

122
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,174
People with powers
are ready for anything.

123
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,505
God! Son of a breach!

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,134
- Sorry.
- Jesse?

125
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,807
Just came in through the breach room.

126
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,135
Hey, Jesse. Welcome back.
What are you doing here?

127
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,351
Wally's not here.

128
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,989
Uh, you know an apology cube
usually works better

129
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,866
when there's an actual apology on it?

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,621
You get the sentiment.

131
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,707
What's this?

132
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,537
That is a mental activity dampener.

133
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,250
It's for DA Cecile Horton.

134
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,047
It keeps her from hearing
other people's thoughts.

135
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,758
Kinda clunky.

136
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,757
That's what she said.
Literally, that's what she said.

137
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,554
The second version is more streamlined.

138
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,303
- And what's all this?
- Those are thoughts.

139
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,010
Musings how to stop DeVoe.

140
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,721
Wow. He's really in your head, isn't he?

141
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,149
Yeah. A lot of people are nowadays.
Thanks to you.

142
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,060
Look, I thought you wanted me
to come here

143
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,144
so we could talk about this.

144
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,321
No, I want you to stop
bringing up your mother.

145
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,320
I will, once you deal with her death.

146
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,526
- I have.
- No, you haven't.

147
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,986
Yes, I have. She died!

148
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,154
Years ago, she died.

149
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,455
There's nothing I could do to save her.

150
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,873
End of story. Life goes on.

151
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,075
Yeah, for everyone but you.

152
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,246
Look, Dad, when Mom died,
you didn't talk about it.

153
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,922
- There's nothing...
- Ever.

154
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,544
And you've been upset
ever since.

155
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,625
You've been miserable.

156
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,381
You make everyone around you miserable.

157
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,928
I mean, why do you think
I asked you to leave my team?

158
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,004
Your team is a bunch of idiots.

159
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,134
- Okay.
- No offense.

160
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,590
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

161
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,095
I came here to stop DeVoe.

162
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,802
No, you stayed because of DeVoe.

163
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,057
A distinction without a difference.

164
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,935
Dad, there's always going to be
some bad guy to stop,

165
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,015
or algorithm to write,

166
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,441
- Yeah.
- or problem to solve.

167
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,768
Yeah. That's my point exactly.

168
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,691
Look...

169
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,284
I didn't want to talk about her death,
but I did.

170
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,236
And it helped a lot.

171
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,955
Trust me. You're never
going to be able to move on

172
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,532
with your life
until you talk about this.

173
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,745
Jesse! I can't! I...

174
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,423
Look, Jesse.

175
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,351
Your mother...

176
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,150
You'll never understand.

177
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,237
Yeah. I guess I won't.

178
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,005
What?

179
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,059
Get down!

180
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,288
- You all right, Jonesy?
- I'll live.

181
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,045
Here, put pressure on it.
Help's on the way.

182
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,585
Who the hell are these guys?
They came out of nowhere.

183
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,387
I don't know. But they want
whatever is in that container.

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,090
Where is that?

185
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,472
One of the hangars out at Wade airfield.

186
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,552
My Dad said

187
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,933
CCPD was escorting A.R.G.U.S. there
this morning for something.

188
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,936
- He's there, Barry.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

189
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,437
- We'll meet you there?
- Cool.

190
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,517
I'll come, too.

191
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,857
I could use the distraction.

192
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,608
Come on, Flash.

193
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,132
Guys, seven officers
and A.R.G.U.S. agents down.

194
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,051
They just blew open
an A.R.G.U.S. transport container.

195
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,379
West side of the hangar,
one armed assailant inside.

196
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,463
<i>Got it.</i>

197
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,846
Come on.

198
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,107
It's ready.

199
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,283
Stay down! Hands, head!

200
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,456
Move, move!

201
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,257
Just you and us now.

202
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,723
Nice work, everyone.

203
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,803
It's over.

204
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,062
For all of Central City.

205
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,776
No.

206
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,832
Barry?

207
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,086
We're too late.

208
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,393
- That's a nuclear bomb.
- I know.

209
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,065
And its core
has already gone critical.

210
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,142
I know.

211
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,602
The second we slow down, it's over.

212
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,187
I know. That's not helping.

213
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,199
Well, how long do you think we have?

214
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,738
We just have to keep moving
until we figure out a way to stop it.

215
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,831
Okay, we could run it to the Badlands.

216
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,205
No. If we run that long,
it will speed up the reaction.

217
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,082
We won't make it outside the city
before it explodes.

218
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,708
But we can't run everyone
outside the city.

219
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,879
I know.

220
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,252
We're talking
hundreds of thousands of people.

221
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,800
Even if there were
more than just the two of us,

222
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,876
there's not enough time.

223
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,175
Wait, that's it. Jay Garrick.

224
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,473
- What about him?
- He might know what to do.

225
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,016
Go to Earth-3, get him,

226
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,434
bring him back here as fast as you can.

227
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,510
- Okay?
- Okay.

228
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,534
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

229
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,751
I need you right now, man.

230
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,671
Hey.

231
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,716
Whoa. What is going on?

232
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,551
You're moving with me at super-speed.

233
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,353
What? Is this what it looks like
when you run?

234
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,429
More or less.

235
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,015
I have to say, it's a little uneventful.

236
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,941
Hey. Come with me.

237
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,449
I'm guessing
this is our Ark of the Covenant.

238
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,071
Something like that, yeah.

239
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,990
Whoa.

240
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,160
Yeah, that will definitely
melt your face.

241
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,293
That looks like

242
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,338
an experimental fission engine,
deuterium isotopes.

243
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,791
That would make this
an inertial confinement cage

244
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,965
to stop the radiation.

245
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,337
But with enough pressure,
the isotopes inside, they split,

246
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,842
they produce heat, they produce light.

247
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,016
Starts out blue, turns yellow,

248
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,685
turns purple and then it's game over.

249
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,307
Just please tell me
there's a way we can undo it.

250
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,640
I think we are way past that point.

251
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,226
- We have to do something.
- I...

252
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,940
What if...
what if I breach it to a dead Earth?

253
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,647
- Like I did with Fallout.
- Of course. Yeah.

254
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,777
That's a great idea.

255
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,857
All right. Do it.

256
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,824
What's wrong?

257
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,332
I think I might be all breached out.

258
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,256
I don't know. I think I breached
one too many times today.

259
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,086
No, that's not it. The breach is
a folding of space-time, right?

260
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,340
So when we're moving this fast...

261
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,138
When we're moving this fast,
when we're moving in Flashtime,

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,718
then we don't have the time necessary
for a breach to form.

263
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,928
- Exactly.
- Then that means I can't...

264
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,269
That means I can't...

265
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,734
Hey, hey. What's wrong?

266
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,903
I don't know.

267
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,940
You're not a speedster.

268
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,071
Your body can't handle
moving this fast very long.

269
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,244
I gotta let go, all right? Come here.

270
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,659
All right.

271
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,618
Wait. Ask Harry. He'll know.

272
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,494
All right.

273
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,372
I hope so.

274
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,186
- Wells...
- How...

275
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,771
- Allen. Why are you touching me? The...
- Hey.

276
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,855
Listen.

277
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,940
Am I in... Am I in...

278
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,991
- Yes, you're in Flashtime. Yes.
- "Flashtime"?

279
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,489
- What is Flashtime?
- Cisco just came up with it.

280
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,787
Wait. You did this with Ramon
before you did this with me?

281
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,205
- Hey, hey, we don't have time!
- Listen, the alarm...

282
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,327
Yes, the alarm that we left for

283
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,580
was an A.R.G.U.S. transport,
it had a fission engine in it.

284
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,285
And it exploded?

285
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,167
That's why I'm in this Flashtime...

286
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,624
Wait. Jesse. Where is Jesse?

287
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,299
No, she's fine. She left. She went to...

288
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,422
Okay, Allen. That's great.

289
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,174
Because if this city is gonna explode,
you need to send her

290
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,550
as far away from here as possible.

291
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,097
Listen. Listen. She went to Earth-3
to get Jay Garrick.

292
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,469
- She's coming back?
- Yes. We need his help.

293
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,394
- Allen, no, no, no. You cannot let her...
- Right now, I need your help, okay?

294
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,142
- How do I stop the reaction?
- You can't stop it, this.

295
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,222
What do you mean? Then what do I do?

296
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,557
You have to send it away from here.

297
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,641
- I can't. We tried.
- Cisco...

298
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,897
- Open... open a...
- Cisco can't open a breach. He can't.

299
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,104
- Because there's no time.
- Exactly.

300
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,358
- But you can.
- What do you mean?

301
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,439
- Allen, you can.
- No, I can't.

302
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,608
- Listen to me. Allen, listen to me!
- What are you talking about?

303
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,445
Space-time breaches
and the portal to the Speed Force

304
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,619
operate under different physics.

305
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,244
You open a portal to the Speed Force,

306
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,869
you send it there.

307
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,368
What will it do to the Speed Force?

308
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,671
- What is... Why am I weak?
- Wells. I know. Wells...

309
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,292
- It's the speed.
- Hey. Listen to me.

310
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,794
- Will an explosion that... I know.
- The speed's affecting...

311
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,672
Will an explosion that big
affect the Speed Force?

312
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,253
I don't think so.

313
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,009
What? What do you mean,
you don't think so?

314
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,715
- Wells, hey...
- What the heck?

315
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,479
Get her out of here. Allen. Allen...

316
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,144
How'd you do that?

317
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,224
Um, I'm not sure.

318
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,686
I've been able to do it ever since
I came out of the Speed Force.

319
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,895
That's a hell of a new trick.

320
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,571
- Look, right now...
- I know.

321
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,148
Jesse showed me the nuke.

322
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,657
We're in trouble, kid.

323
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,701
Well, I don't know. Wells has an idea
that he thinks might work.

324
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,777
Yeah, what is it?

325
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,659
We send the bomb into the Speed Force.

326
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,990
Let it detonate in there.

327
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,541
- Like hell, you will.
- What do you mean? Why not?

328
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,870
Because, Flash, if you do that,

329
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,829
we may lose the Speed Force forever.

330
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,093
What do you mean,
we might lose the Speed Force?

331
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,425
An explosion of that size
could destroy it completely.

332
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,603
If that were to happen,
every speedster across space and time

333
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,520
would lose access
to their speed instantly.

334
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,598
Every speedster?

335
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,940
Even if it got rid of Thawne
and every other evil speedster

336
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,238
in the multi-verse, you cannot do this.

337
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,148
I won't let you.

338
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,193
Well, I'm sorry, Jay.

339
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,280
If this is the only way to save
everyone in the city, I have to.

340
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,884
Barry, listen to me.

341
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,674
Harry didn't know anything
about the Speed Force, okay?

342
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,136
None of us really do
and this isn't just about speed.

343
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,971
You're talking about destroying
an essential element

344
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,181
of the multi-verse.

345
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,858
Nobody knows
what the consequences will be.

346
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,936
You were trapped in there
longer than I was.

347
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,270
If anyone can understand...

348
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,071
Then what, Jay?
What's your idea?

349
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,323
Okay, look. I mean,
did my dad have any other ideas?

350
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,330
No, but we couldn't talk
for very long.

351
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,626
Jay, I'm sorry. I just...

352
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,457
No. That's all right, kid. I get it.

353
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,093
All right. Back to basics.

354
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,843
In nuclear fission,
enormous energy is created

355
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,097
by a chain reaction of atoms
splitting and releasing neutrons.

356
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,892
It's nearly impossible
to reverse this process.

357
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:32,192
But theoretically,
you could restore stability.

358
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,102
How?

359
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,610
One way is to offset the loss
of mass by nuclear fusion.

360
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,192
Great.
You have some sort of machine

361
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,993
lying around here
that can generate that kind of energy?

362
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,321
- No, we don't.
- But the other way,

363
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,328
considering our predicament,
seems more promising.

364
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,499
Which is what?

365
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,703
Cooling it down.

366
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,210
We need to hurry.

367
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,509
Hey.

368
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,851
I see all these frozen people
around me, Flash,

369
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,522
and this time it's not my fault.

370
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,816
We need your help.

371
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,689
Three of you, now. What's going on?

372
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,271
- The cargo in this container...
- It's a nuclear bomb.

373
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,776
Yeah, and it went kaboom.

374
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,865
- Dandy.
- Come here.

375
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,945
It's toasty in here.

376
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,450
We need you to cool it down.

377
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,203
You want me to cool down
a nuclear reaction

378
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,001
that's already gone critical?

379
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,382
- You're serious?
- Quickly, please, Miss Frost.

380
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,759
All right. Let's give it a whirl.

381
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,180
Didn't go quite how I expected.

382
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,686
Try... try again.

383
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,194
No, no.

384
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,072
So that's what heat feels like.

385
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,123
You're burning up. Come on.

386
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,373
All right. It's okay. All right.

387
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,089
I have to let you go. All right?

388
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,042
Barry...

389
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,378
Don't let Caity die.

390
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,090
Okay.

391
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,802
Now what?

392
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,479
Guess we have to find
that fusion machine after all.

393
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,856
- Wait a second.
- What?

394
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,355
What if we're the machine?

395
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,522
How so?

396
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,906
Well, you said that we could
offset the energy of the bomb

397
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,282
with the energy from nuclear fusion.

398
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,408
Theoretically.

399
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,956
Right, and the reaction
that container is giving off,

400
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,079
I don't know,
three million tons of energy?

401
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,331
Give or take.

402
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,415
So, three megatons of energy,
that's three billion joules.

403
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,000
Each lightning bolt gives off
roughly one billion joules, so...

404
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,960
So if we all throw a lightning bolt
at the same time...

405
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,135
It could be enough.

406
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,931
That's enough.
That will work. Let's do it.

407
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,817
Jay! Hey.

408
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,861
Hey.

409
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,233
I'm not used to going this long.

410
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,650
- Hey, hey. It's okay. It's all right.
- Damn legs.

411
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,201
Don't work like they once did.

412
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,277
It's okay.

413
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,862
I'm not gonna be able
to finish this one, Flash.

414
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,572
- I'm sorry.
- Just rest.

415
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,959
I'm so sorry.

416
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,726
Barry, the two of us can't produce
enough lightning power

417
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,600
to offset the energy from that bomb.

418
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,729
I mean, even if we had full speed,
which we don't... At least, I don't.

419
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,895
We have to send it into the Speed Force.

420
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,943
You heard what Jay said.

421
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,319
And Harry said it would be fine.

422
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,492
No, he said he thinks it would be fine.

423
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,036
Barry, my dad never thinks anything,
he knows.

424
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,747
Jay was right. We can't do it.

425
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,285
Damn it!

426
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,920
Okay, what if... I don't know,

427
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,376
what if we run back in time

428
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,302
and stop this bomb from ever going off?

429
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,880
No, Jesse. We can't do that.

430
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:30,964
Yeah, well,
it's kind of our only option.

431
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,048
It's not an option.

432
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,724
Even if it saves the city
and everyone in it?

433
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,097
It's not saving them, okay?

434
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,473
The second you alter the timeline,

435
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,272
everything changes,
especially the people you love.

436
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,441
Trust me. I learned that the hard way.

437
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,019
Well, maybe a new version of my dad
isn't the worst thing in the world.

438
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,656
Look, Jesse,
whatever problems you two have,

439
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,982
they're not gonna get solved
by forcing him

440
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,068
to do something he doesn't want to.

441
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,572
He has to make that decision.

442
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,493
Oh, God.

443
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,541
The reaction's combustion's
reached its final phase.

444
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,713
I think we're slowing down.

445
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,920
So everything else is speeding up.

446
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,214
Barry, I don't have any more ideas.

447
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,298
Me either.

448
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,846
I don't know how much longer I can run.

449
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,352
You have to get out of here.

450
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,642
Use the speed you have left
to get back to Earth-2.

451
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,895
- Your dad wanted you to leave.
- Yeah, I heard.

452
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,018
So you'd be safe, Jesse.

453
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,021
He loves you, all right?
More than anything.

454
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,689
Go.

455
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,615
- No, I can't just...
- Go.

456
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,958
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,894
I wish I could tell you this
while you could still hear me.

458
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,151
I know how happy Mom made you,

459
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,653
and how sad you are now that she's gone.

460
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,703
But I just... I don't know why
you won't talk about it.

461
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,035
I don't know, maybe you don't need to.

462
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,035
I just want you to be happy again.

463
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,789
That's all I've ever wanted.

464
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,203
<i>And I don't know
the PSI...</i>

465
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,287
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

466
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,665
<i>No, this won't work. Damn!</i>

467
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,347
<i>Oh, God,
I think it's happening.</i>

468
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,214
- Oh, Barry. What...
- Iris.

469
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,299
- I'm...
- You're moving as fast as I am,

470
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,633
like in the courtroom.

471
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,968
What? Why, didn't you...

472
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,644
- I can't.
- Oh, my God. What?

473
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,720
I can't.

474
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,396
I can't save us this time.

475
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,449
What do you mean you can't save us?

476
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,875
- There's a bomb.
- What?

477
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,044
A nuke. It's already gone off.
I can't stop it.

478
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,962
Wait... but... there's got to be
something that you can do...

479
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,414
No, I tried. We tried everything.

480
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,091
We tried lightning,
we tried cooling it down,

481
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,090
breaching it to a dead Earth.
There's nothing that would work.

482
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,181
- I don't know what to do.
- Okay.

483
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,384
- As soon as I stop, it's gonna...
- I know. I know.

484
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,310
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

485
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,480
I don't know how much longer
I can hold out.

486
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,063
- I'm so tired.
- Okay. It's okay, Barry.

487
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,644
Oh, my God, you're burning up.

488
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,774
- I've been at this for a while. For me.
- Okay.

489
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,737
- Hey. Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm sorry.

490
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,614
No, don't be sorry.
Look at me, be here with me.

491
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:47,038
- I'm...
- I love you. Okay?

492
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,419
This isn't exactly the quality time
I was imagining,

493
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,465
but it's still nice.

494
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,924
Every moment with you, Barry,
has always been nice.

495
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,175
Every moment.

496
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,058
You're my lightning rod, Iris.

497
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,263
What?

498
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,390
What?

499
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,189
You said
you tried to use lightning. How?

500
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,611
We tried. It didn't work.

501
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,315
If it was powerful enough,
it could've fused the split atoms,

502
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,945
it could've negated the effects
of the bomb.

503
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,238
But I can't do it alone.

504
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,695
I can't generate that kind of energy.

505
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,622
No, you can't, but the Speed Force can.

506
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,745
What?

507
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,703
When you went into the Speed Force,
the lightning from the storm...

508
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,664
One of those bolts would be
more than enough,

509
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,379
but I can't...
How could I draw that out?

510
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,301
No, listen. When we freed you,

511
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,549
Cisco and Caitlin,
they used a Quark Sphere

512
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,630
programmed with your genetic marker

513
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,137
to trick the Speed Force into thinking
that you were still in there.

514
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,468
- I just need to get that sphere.
- Yeah.

515
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,394
The storm will chase me.

516
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,930
It's like you said.

517
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,273
A lightning rod
to bring out the lightning.

518
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,614
- Come back to me.
- As fast as I can.

519
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,133
Here we go.

520
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,299
Jesse.

521
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,010
You're here.

522
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,887
I'm here.

523
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:55,779
Barry? Barry! Barry!

524
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,163
Flash! Flash!

525
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,377
Flash.

526
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,048
Are we dead?

527
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,058
- No.
- That's good.

528
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,278
<i>Today, I showed you
how easy a city can fall.</i>

529
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,238
<i>Mark my words.</i>

530
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,579
<i>Nuclear power will bring
only destruction to the world.</i>

531
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,910
<i>You'll see it again.</i>

532
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,333
<i>And when you do,</i>

533
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,002
<i>you'll all remember
the name Veronica Dale,</i>

534
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,421
<i>and fully understand my actions.</i>

535
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,134
<i>Eden Corps. Eden Corps!</i>

536
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,843
<i>Eden Corps!</i>

537
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,884
I feel like she's saying, "Eden Corps."

538
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,017
As in blasting everybody back
to the days of the Garden of Eden.

539
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,311
This was to air after the city fell.

540
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,184
Found her manifesto at her apartment.

541
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,516
Environmental activist
turned animal-liberator,

542
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,771
turned domestic terrorist.

543
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,851
Turned cray-cray.

544
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,441
How did she find out about
the A.R.G.U.S. drop, anyway?

545
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,897
Somebody must have tipped her off.

546
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,148
DeVoe.

547
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,858
But why would he, or she, whoever...

548
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,568
Why blow up the whole city?

549
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,698
Why kill nearly everyone here?

550
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,404
Maybe there is no method to the madness.

551
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,742
Well, this was fun, as usual.

552
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,669
But it's time for the old crimson comet
to head back home.

553
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,087
Thanks for your help, Jay.

554
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,415
Yeah. If it wasn't
for you two and Jesse,

555
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,126
it'd be a completely different story
in the news right now.

556
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,008
You were a big part of that, Iris.

557
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,508
Credit where credit's due.

558
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,931
My sentiments exactly.

559
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,554
So when you get home, you need to rest.

560
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,136
Your glucose levels are pretty low.

561
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,766
Thanks. When I get back,

562
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,848
I think I'll be doing nothing
but getting rest.

563
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,182
Meaning?

564
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,485
I've been at this hero game a long time.

565
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,653
A long, long time, and after today,

566
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,402
I'm thinking about trying my hand
at something new.

567
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,612
Like what?

568
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,368
For starters,
training someone to take over.

569
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,325
There's another Flash on your Earth?

570
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,870
There will be,
as soon as I'm done training her.

571
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,497
Her?

572
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,668
What, do you think we're good
with the Speed Force?

573
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,049
Well, if not,
we'll find out soon enough.

574
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,058
- Always a pleasure, Flash.
- Always.

575
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,603
So, you need to rest as well, mister.

576
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,567
No running, no Flash.
Your system's taxed.

577
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,192
- I'm good.
- You will be, but you're not yet.

578
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,899
That's right.
Anything comes up, we got it.

579
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,243
Iris, make sure this man rests.

580
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,655
I'm on it.

581
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,996
- Long time.
- Yes, it was.

582
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,872
You know,

583
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,299
I realized a couple of things
when I was in Flashtime.

584
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,921
Yeah, what's that?

585
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,929
Well, I'm more than fast enough
to catch DeVoe.

586
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,097
We just need to know

587
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,719
when he's coming out
of the pocket dimension sooner.

588
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,262
Yeah. We'll figure that out.

589
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,356
What's the other thing?

590
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,770
You were right about taking a breather.

591
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:22,944
Just a moment with you,
being grounded again.

592
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,696
Everything becomes more clear.

593
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,124
Scooch over.

594
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,708
Sorry about date night.

595
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,838
Don't be.

596
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:43,343
Power bars and sweatpants.
It's all I really need.

597
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,111
Uh, this is my exit.

598
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,941
You... oh.

599
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,409
- Right.
- Yeah.

600
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:14,541
Jesse, the reason
that I can't talk about...

601
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:18,170
You know what? It's okay.
You don't have to explain.

602
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,335
I don't... I don't?
I thought that's what you wanted.

603
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,846
Yeah, um...

604
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,057
I don't know, I thought making you

605
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,682
confront all the emotions
that you have with losing Mom

606
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,812
would help you move on
and be happy again.

607
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,441
But I can't decide when you're
ready to do that. Only you can.

608
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,615
- So, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry. It's okay.

609
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,030
I do want you to know though,

610
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:50,286
if the time comes
and you want to talk about it,

611
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,456
I'm here.

612
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,838
Actually, if that's the case,

613
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,668
why don't you stick around
for a little bit longer?

614
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,469
- What, you wanna talk now?
- No. I'd like you to listen.

615
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,099
Have a seat.

616
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,927
I'm gonna fix this to your forehead.

617
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,052
What is that?

618
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,308
It's the streamlined version

619
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,640
of DA Cecile Horton's
mental activity dampener.

620
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,606
- Nice upgrade.
- Thank you.

621
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:23,235
But I thought this was supposed
to block out people's thoughts?

622
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,314
Not anymore.

623
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,198
Now, it allows you to hear them.

624
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,787
Your mother.

625
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,004
I don't know how... I don't...

626
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,724
You see, when you have a love,
had a love,

627
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,562
like your mother and I had,
and you lose that love...

628
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,115
Anyway, um,

629
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,362
maybe this will help you understand
why it's been so hard for me.

630
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,590
<i>Because, in the vast night sky,</i>

631
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,007
<i>you are the only star I see.</i>

632
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,837
Mom.

633
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,650
<i>She's a miracle.</i>

634
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,356
<i>Jesse.</i>

635
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,909
<i>She's just like me.</i>

636
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,790
<i>Sweetie, come here.</i>

637
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,374
<i>Be with me.</i>

638
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,213
Thank you, Allie.

639
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,299
- So...
- So.

640
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,551
Jesse seemed better when she left.

641
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,635
So do you.

642
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,429
Did you guys have a nice talk?

643
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,483
Well, it was actually more of
a listening session than a talk,

644
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,105
but we're good. Yeah. Both of us.

645
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,236
That's good, Harry.

646
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,735
- Yeah. And what about you?
- What?

647
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:30,862
Come on. I know you well enough to know

648
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,944
that something's on your mind.
What is it?

649
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,285
It's Killer Frost.

650
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,365
What about Killer Frost?

651
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,453
I don't know anything
that she says or does.

652
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,291
It's scary and alarming
to have this person

653
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,421
that you know nothing about
living inside of you.

654
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,964
But for the first time,

655
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,922
I remember what she did.

656
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,220
What do you remember?

657
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,391
Barry taking her into Flashtime,
trying to freeze the bomb...

658
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,470
Mmm-hmm.

659
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:04,647
And Killer Frost being worried.

660
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,445
Worried about what, about dying?

661
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,355
About me.

662
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,691
Interesting.

663
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,946
Oh, my gosh.

664
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,903
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to drop that.

665
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,239
- It just slipped out of my hands.
- It's okay.

666
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,950
My first Killer Frost

667
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,285
and I go and ruin it.

668
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,835
- That's...
- Typical... typical me.

669
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,083
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

670
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,789
I just get so clumsy when I'm nervous.

671
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:27,873
What are you nervous about?

672
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,218
I'm supposed to be meeting
some people here for the first time

673
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,340
and I've got the jitters.

674
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,387
Which
is what this place is called.

675
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,590
Hey, it is.

676
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,675
- Apt name, don't you think?
- I do.

677
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,936
It's funny. You know, you get nervous,
you get the jitters, you go for coffee

678
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,058
and the caffeine acts as a stimulant,

679
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,980
which makes you shaky,
which could also be known as...

680
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,308
- The jitters.
- Exactly.

681
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,942
Okay, right. I get it.

682
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,988
Okay. We're gonna go.

683
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,190
- Okay.
- Yeah.

684
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,527
- I'm really very, very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

685
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,782
Good luck with your meeting.
