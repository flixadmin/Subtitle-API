FIND IT IN YOUR HEART

<i>BUT THE TALES</i>

65

<i>IT WOULD BE AN HONOR</i>

I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH

102
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,756
YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.

103
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,425
YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MANY THINGS.

104
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,594
HE'LL STILL ENJOY
BEATING YOU.

105
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,680
AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE A WOMAN,

106
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,642
HE'LL BE ABLE TO ENJOY YOU
IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL.

HE'LL LET YOU GO HOME?

109

JOFFREY'S NOT THE SORT OF BOY
WHO GIVES AWAY HIS TOYS.

110

YOU HAVE A TENDER HEART,

111

JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER
DID AT YOUR AGE.

112
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,827
I CAN SEE SO MUCH

YOU SURE?

128

MOST MEN LIKE

129

IF YOU DON'T WANT
WHAT MOST MEN WANT,

132
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,359
THEN YOU'D BETTER TELL ME
WHAT YOU'D LIKE ME TO DO.

133
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,988
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME
IF WORKING FOR LORD BAELISH

134
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,324
HAS BEEN ALL YOU'D
HOPED IT WOULD BE.

136
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,580
YOU WOULDN'T
REMEMBER ME IF WE HAD?

137
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,332
I MEET A LOT OF MEN.

138
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,917
AND I THINK YOU
REMEMBER ALL OF THEM.

139
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,546
I THINK YOUR TRUE TALENTS
ARE WASTED ON THEM.

140
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,382
YOU'RE VERY KIND,
MY LORD.

141
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,843
ALLOW ME TO RETURN
THE FAVOR.

142
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,268
YOU'RE AFRAID.

143
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,146
WHY?
NOTHING DANGEROUS
DOWN THERE.

144
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,357
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,651
AND, UNLIKE YOUR
CURRENT EMPLOYER,

146
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,488
I PROTECT THOSE
WHO WORK FOR ME.

147
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,407
I DON'T ABUSE THEM
TO SATISFY ROYAL WHIMS

148
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,202
OR FORCE THEM
TO ABUSE EACH OTHER.

149
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,912
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

150
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,582
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU KNEW WHO I WAS.

151
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,461
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
LORD VARYS?

152
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,101
LITTLEFINGER LOOKS AT YOU

153
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,520
AND SEES A COLLECTION
OF PROFITABLE HOLES.

154
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:32,108
I SEE A POTENTIAL
PARTNER.

155
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,070
- I'M AFRAID OF HIM.
- OH, YOU SHOULD BE.

156
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,906
HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN.

157
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,201
BUT EVERYONE HAS
THEIR WEAKNESSES.

158
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,288
YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER
HIDES HIS VERY WELL,

159
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,833
BUT NOT AS WELL
AS HE THINKS.

160
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,631
YOU'RE A VIRGIN,
I TAKE IT?

161
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,633
WALK.

162
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,470
CHILDHOOD MUST HAVE
BEEN AWFUL FOR YOU.

163
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,640
WERE YOU A FOOT TALLER
THAN ALL THE BOYS?

164
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,643
THEY LAUGHED AT YOU,
CALLED YOU NAMES?

165
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,895
SOME BOYS
LIKE A CHALLENGE.

166
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,399
ONE OR TWO MUST HAVE
TRIED TO GET INSIDE
BIG BRIENNE.

167
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,527
- ONE OR TWO TRIED.
- AH.

168
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,696
BUT YOU FOUGHT THEM OFF.

169
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,824
BUT MAYBE YOU WISHED ONE
OF THEM COULD OVERPOWER YOU,

170
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,410
FLING YOU DOWN,
TEAR OFF YOUR CLOTHES.

171
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,662
BUT NONE OF THEM
WERE STRONG ENOUGH.

172
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,914
- I'M STRONG ENOUGH.
- NOT INTERESTED.

173
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,583
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

174
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,461
YOU'D LOVE TO KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE A WOMAN.

175
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,925
<i>AH. "THEY LAY</i>
<i>WITH LIONS."</i>

176
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,469
TAVERN GIRLS, I'D SAY.

177
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,513
PROBABLY SERVED
MY FATHER'S SOLDIERS.

178
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,808
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
GAVE UP A KISS AND A FEEL.

179
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,352
THAT'S HOW
THEY EARNED THIS.

180
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,273
THE GLORIOUS WORK
OF THE NORTHERN
FREEDOM FIGHTERS.

181
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,567
MUST MAKE YOU PROUD
TO SERVE THE STARKS.

182
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,529
I DON'T SERVE THE STARKS.
I SERVE LADY CATELYN.

183
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,657
TELL YOURSELF THAT TONIGHT
WHEN THEY SWING IN YOUR DREAMS.

184
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,660
( groans )

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,164
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- BURYING THEM.

186
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,584
WE SHOULDN'T STAY HERE.
WE SHOULD GET BACK ON
THE RIVER.

187
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,920
I THINK THESE WOMEN
WOULD UNDERSTAND IF--

188
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,338
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK.

189
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,839
Man:
<i>I DIDN'T LEAVE IT HERE.</i>

190
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,467
UNTIE ME NOW.

191
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,011
Man:<i> I GAVE IT TO YOU TO CUT</i>
<i>THE ROPE, AND NOW I DON'T</i>
<i>HAVE ME DAGGER NO MORE.</i>

192
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,472
SO UNLESS IT GOT
STUCK IN YOUR ASS
ON ITS WAY TO YOUR CUNT,

193
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,517
IT STANDS TO REASON
THAT IT'S GONE-- WHOA!

194
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,770
WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS HERE?

195
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,813
TRAVELING A PRISONER.

196
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,107
( laughing )

197
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,569
YOU'RE A WOMAN.
A WOMAN!

198
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,571
<i>WELL, FUCK ME!</i>

199
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,324
IF YOU'VE QUITE
FINISHED UP--

200
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,243
( laughing )

201
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,203
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL BE GOING.

202
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,997
WHOA, WHOA.

203
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,707
WHO DO YOU FIGHT FOR?

204
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,210
THE STARKS.

205
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,422
WHAT DID HE DO?

206
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,551
APPARENTLY EATING
IS NOW A CRIME.
WHO KNEW?

207
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,261
NO, STEALING IS A CRIME.

208
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,513
BUT IT'S NOT
A CRIME TO STARVE.
THAT'S JUSTICE FOR YOU.

209
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,723
-<i> WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM?</i>
<i>- TO RIVERRUN.</i>

210
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,559
WHY RIVERRUN?

211
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,270
STEAL FROM THE TULLYS,
IT'S THEIR DUNGEONS
YOU ROT IN.

212
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,772
- WHY NOT KILL HIM?
- FOR STEALING A PIG?

213
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,774
I DON'T GIVE THE ORDERS.

214
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,484
HE MUST BE IMPORTANT
TO SOMEONE.

215
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,446
SENDING HIM WITH YOU?
HOW IMPORTANT COULD HE BE?

216
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,283
ALL RIGHT,
HAVE IT YOUR WAY,

217
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,451
M'LADY.

218
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,416
- DO I KNOW YOU?
- HAVE YOU BEEN TO ASHEMARK?

219
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,626
-<i> NO.</i>
<i>- THEN YOU DON'T KNOW ME.</i>

220
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,838
DO YOU EVER GO TO THE RIVER
MARKET AT SALT ROCK?

221
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,424
- IS IT NEAR ASHEMARK?
-<i> NO.</i>

222
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,925
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

223
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,636
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THESE BEAUTIES?

224
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,140
I HOPE YOU GAVE THEM
QUICK DEATHS.

225
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,268
TWO OF THEM WE DID, YEAH.

226
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,772
WAIT.

227
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,444
I DO KNOW YOU.

228
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,571
THAT'S JAIME LANNISTER.

229
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,324
I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME.
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO STEAL THAT PIG.

230
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,826
IF THIS IS THE KINGSLAYER,
I THINK I'D KNOW ABOUT IT.

231
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,661
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE KINGSLAYER LOOKS LIKE?

232
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,997
I WAS AT WHISPERING WOOD.
I SAW HIM.

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT</i>
<i>OF THE WOODS AND THREW HIM</i>
<i>DOWN BEFORE THE KING.</i>

234
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,294
HE'S NOT THE KINGSLAYER.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

235
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,421
IF HE WAS, I'D ONLY
BE TRAVELING HIS HEAD.

236
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,590
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU BOTH.

237
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,842
AND I WANT YOU TO ANSWER IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

238
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,553
<i>I COUNT TO THREE,</i>
<i>YOU BOTH ANSWER.</i>

239
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,139
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

240
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,516
ONE.

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,227
<i>TWO. THREE.</i>

242
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,911
TWO QUICK DEATHS.

243
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,791
<i>( man grunts )</i>

244
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,004
<i>( slowly slicing )</i>

245
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,066
THOSE WERE STARK MEN.

246
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,152
I DON'T SERVE THE STARKS.

247
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,946
I SERVE LADY CATELYN.

248
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
I TOLD HER I'D TAKE YOU
TO KING'S LANDING,

249
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,617
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

250
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,162
STAY.

251
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,587
( grunts )

252
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,173
-<i> ( bodies thud )</i>
<i>- ( groans )</i>

253
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,933
WALDER FREY IS A DANGEROUS
MAN TO CROSS.

254
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,393
I KNOW THAT.

255
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,687
AND YOU MEAN
TO DO IT ANYWAY?

256
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,609
I LOVE HER.

257
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,154
I KNOW THAT SEEMS
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

258
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,030
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

259
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,369
YOUR FATHER DIDN'T LOVE
ME WHEN WE MARRIED.

260
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,664
HE HARDLY KNEW ME
OR I HIM.

261
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,586
LOVE DIDN'T JUST
HAPPEN TO US.

262
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,297
WE BUILT IT SLOWLY
OVER THE YEARS,

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,466
STONE BY STONE,

264
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,885
FOR YOU, FOR YOUR
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

265
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,387
FOR ALL OF US.

266
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,433
IT'S NOT AS EXCITING
AS SECRET PASSION
IN THE WOODS,

267
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,394
BUT IT IS STRONGER.

268
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,397
IT LASTS LONGER.

269
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,649
AND THAT IS WHAT
WOULD BE IN STORE FOR ME

270
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,443
WITH ONE OF
WALDER FREY'S DAUGHTERS,

271
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,196
- WHAT YOU AND FATHER HAD?
- WHY NOT?

272
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,156
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT BEAUTIFUL?

273
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,200
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT EXOTIC
AND EXCITING?

274
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,203
NOW YOU'RE ARGUING
JUST TO ARGUE BECAUSE
YOU ARRANGED IT.

275
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,289
AND YOU AGREED TO IT.

276
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,124
YOU GAVE HIM YOUR WORD.

277
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:09,046
TREAT YOUR OATHS
RECKLESSLY AND YOUR
PEOPLE WILL DO THE SAME.

278
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,964
IF YOUR FATHER LIVED
HIS LIFE FOR ONE THING--

279
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,008
MY FATHER IS DEAD.

280
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:17,846
AND THE ONLY PARENT
I HAVE LEFT HAS NO RIGHT
TO CALL ANYONE RECKLESS.

281
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

282
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,077
YOU SAID YOU SAW
MY VICTORY IN THE FLAMES.

283
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,120
Melisandre:
<i>I DID.</i>

284
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,541
- I STILL SEE IT.
- THE FLAMES LIED.

285
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,710
AND I'M NO BETTER
THAN A SAVAGE

286
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,796
TRUSTING IN A FIRE GOD.

287
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,843
I FOUGHT FOR YOUR GOD
IN BLACKWATER BAY.

288
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,263
I LED MY MEN TO THE GATES
OF THE SEVENTH HELL

289
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,474
AS THEIR BROTHERS BURNED
ALIVE, AND FOR WHAT?

290
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,478
ATTACKED FROM BEHIND
BY TYWIN LANNISTER
AND THE TYRELLS.

291
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,605
IF YOU SEE
SO MUCH IN YOUR FLAMES,
WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN ME?

292
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,566
THE LORD OF LIGHT
ONLY ALLOWS ME GLIMPSES.

293
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,860
YOU CLAIMED TO SPEAK
FOR A GOD.

294
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,362
WILL YOU QUIT THE WAR
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE LOST
A BATTLE?

295
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,239
YOU TALK ABOUT WAR
AS IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT.

296
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,324
<i>I'VE BEEN FIGHTING</i>
<i>FAR LONGER THAN YOU.</i>

297
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,619
HAVE YOU?
SHOW ME HOW YOU FIGHT.

298
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,163
( gasping )

299
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,293
SHOW ME.

300
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,009
WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW?

301
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,095
WILL HE SAVE YOU?

302
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,015
WHERE IS YOUR GOD?

303
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,644
INSIDE YOU.

304
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,398
( groans )

305
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,817
( breathing heavily )

306
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,906
I MURDERED MY BROTHER.

307
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

308
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,750
WE MURDERED HIM.

309
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,501
SHARE THE WEIGHT
WITH ME.

310
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,962
HE WASN'T YOUR BROTHER.

311
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,969
THIS WAR
HAS JUST BEGUN.

312
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,305
IT WILL LAST FOR YEARS.

313
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,643
THOUSANDS WILL DIE
AT YOUR COMMAND.

314
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,979
YOU WILL BETRAY
THE MEN SERVING YOU.

315
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,982
YOU WILL BETRAY
YOUR FAMILY.

316
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,527
YOU WILL BETRAY EVERYTHING
YOU ONCE HELD DEAR.

317
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,282
AND IT WILL ALL
BE WORTH IT

318
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,452
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE SON OF FIRE.

319
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,705
YOU ARE THE WARRIOR
OF LIGHT.

320
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,378
YOU WILL SWEEP ASIDE
THIS PRETENDER AND THAT ONE.

321
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,923
YOU WILL BE KING.

322
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,846
YOU PROMISE
THESE THINGS, BUT...

323
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,724
YOU DON'T KNOW.

324
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,893
NONE OF US KNOW.

325
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,020
LET ME SHOW YOU.

326
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,031
LOOK INTO THE FIRE,
MY KING.

327
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,575
LOOK.

328
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,578
I SEE FIRE.

329
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,747
KEEP LOOKING.

330
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>( flame roaring )</i>

331
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,090
DO YOU SEE?

332
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,759
DO YOU SEE, MY KING?

333
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,905
YES.

334
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,831
<i>( horn blows )</i>

335
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,169
I WILL KILL THAT MAN.

336
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,838
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY ARROWS
THEY FEATHER ME WITH,

337
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,257
HOW MANY SPEARS
THEY RUN THROUGH ME,

338
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,427
I WILL KILL
THAT HORN-BLOWING
CUNT BEFORE I FALL.

339
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,096
THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU'RE SURROUNDED.

340
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,223
I KNOW I'M SURROUNDED.

341
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,101
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I STOOD
ON THE BATTLEMENTS

342
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,936
AND SAW I WAS SURROUNDED.

343
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,605
<i>THEY DON'T WANT</i>
<i>YOU TO SLEEP.</i>

344
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,648
THEY WANT TO SAP
YOUR SPIRIT BEFORE--

345
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,194
THANK YOU, WISE BALD MAN.

346
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,489
THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING
SIEGE TACTICS TO ME.

347
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,950
<i>( horn continues )</i>

348
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,244
NO WORD FROM MY FATHER?

349
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,790
NO.

350
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,167
SEND MORE RAVENS.

351
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,505
YOU KILLED
ALL THE RAVENS.

352
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,802
THE FIRST TIME
I SAW WINTERFELL...

353
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,763
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

354
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,769
THE FIRST TIME
I SAW WINTERFELL,

355
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:20,190
IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING
THAT HAD BEEN HERE FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS

356
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,275
AND WOULD BE HERE
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS

357
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,736
AFTER I WAS DEAD.

358
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,116
I SAW IT
AND I THOUGHT,

359
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,827
"OF COURSE NED STARK
CRUSHED OUR REBELLION

360
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,579
AND KILLED MY BROTHERS.

361
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,124
WE NEVER STOOD
A CHANCE AGAINST
A MAN WHO LIVES HERE."

362
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,835
LORD STARK
WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO MAKE IT YOUR HOME.

363
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,254
YES, MY CAPTORS WERE
SO VERY KIND TO ME.

364
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,756
YOU LOVE
REMINDING ME OF THAT.

365
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,468
EVERYONE IN THIS
FROZEN PILE OF SHIT

366
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,179
HAS ALWAYS LOVED
REMINDING ME OF THAT.

367
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,059
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE TOLD HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

368
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,061
TO BE SOMEONE'S PRISONER?

369
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,899
TO BE TOLD HOW MUCH
YOU OWE THEM?

370
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,446
AND THEN TO GO BACK HOME
TO YOUR REAL FATHER...

371
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,325
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

372
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,077
I WILL KILL THAT MAN.

373
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,453
I SWEAR IT TO
THE DROWNED GOD,

374
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,539
THE OLD GODS,
THE NEW GODS,

375
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,042
TO EVERY FUCKING GOD
IN EVERY FUCKING HEAVEN,
I WILL KILL THAT MAN.

376
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,837
THEON, LISTEN TO ME.

377
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,047
I SERVE WINTERFELL.

378
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,259
NOW WINTERFELL IS YOURS.

379
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,678
I'M BOUND BY OATH
TO SERVE YOU.

380
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,598
AND WHAT'S YOUR COUNSEL,
TRUSTED FRIEND?

381
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,725
RUN.

382
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,188
500 NORTHMEN WAIT
OUTSIDE THE WALLS.
YOU HAVE 20 MEN.

383
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,064
YOU CAN'T WIN.

384
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,358
WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL
AND RUN.

385
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,903
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN.

386
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,863
I'D NEVER MAKE IT BACK
TO THE IRON ISLANDS.

387
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,532
AND EVEN IF I DID,
EVEN IF BY SOME MIRACLE

388
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,535
I SLIPPED THROUGH THE LINES
AND MADE IT HOME,

389
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,913
I'D BE A COWARD.

390
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,540
THE GREYJOY WHO RAN.

391
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,461
THE SHAME OF THE FAMILY.

392
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,215
DON'T GO HOME.

393
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,426
<i>JOIN THE NIGHT'S WATCH.</i>

394
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,555
ONCE A MAN
HAS TAKEN THE BLACK...

395
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,936
HE'S BEYOND REACH
OF THE LAW.

396
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,105
ALL HIS PAST CRIMES
ARE FORGIVEN.

397
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,109
I WON'T MAKE IT
TO THE WALL.

398
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,446
I WON'T MAKE IT 10 FEET
PAST THE WINTERFELL GATES.

399
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,531
THERE ARE WAYS.

400
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,576
HIDDEN PASSAGEWAYS BUILT
SO THE LORDS OF WINTERFELL

401
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,037
COULD ESCAPE.

402
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,581
THE ROAD WILL BE DANGEROUS.

403
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,127
BUT WITH A LITTLE LUCK...

404
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:53,843
THE NIGHT'S WATCH
IS AN ANCIENT,
HONORABLE ORDER.

405
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,640
YOU'LL HAVE
OPPORTUNITIES THERE.

406
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,936
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR JON SNOW
TO CUT MY THROAT IN MY SLEEP.

407
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,065
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
AMENDS FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

408
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,444
I'VE DONE A LOT,
HAVEN'T I?

409
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,323
THINGS I NEVER
IMAGINED MYSELF DOING.

410
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,955
I'VE KNOWN YOU MANY YEARS,
THEON GREYJOY.

411
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,627
YOU'RE NOT THE MAN
YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE.

412
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,589
NOT YET.

413
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,095
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

414
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,767
BUT I'VE GONE TOO FAR
TO PRETEND TO BE
ANYTHING ELSE.

<i>( horn blowing )</i>

416
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,238

417
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,283
THAT'S THE MATING CALL
OF THE NORTHMEN.

418
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,328
THEY WANT TO FUCK US.

419
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,455
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD
A GOOD FUCK IN WEEKS.

420

- I'M READY FOR ONE.
- ( men laugh )

421
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,878

IRONBORN MAN IS WORTH
A DOZEN FROM THE MAINLAND.

Men:
AYE!

- YOU THINK THEY'RE RIGHT?
- Men: AYE.

00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,512
WE DIE TODAY, BROTHERS.

00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,682
WE DIE BLEEDING
FROM 100 WOUNDS

WITH ARROWS IN OUR NECKS
AND SPEARS IN OUR GUTS,

BUT OUR WAR CRIES WILL ECHO
THROUGH ETERNITY.

THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL

UNTIL THE IRON ISLANDS HAVE
SLIPPED BENEATH THE WAVES.

430
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,368
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD
WILL KNOW WHO WE WERE

516
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,695
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

517
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,280
SO DO IT.

518
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,532
YOUR FATHER, YOUR SISTER,
ALL THESE BAD PEOPLE,

519
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,451
THEY CAN'T STOP YOU.

520
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,745
FORGET ABOUT THEM.
COME WITH ME.

521
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,083
I CAN'T.

522
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,835
I DO BELONG HERE.

523
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
THESE BAD PEOPLE

524
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,674
ARE WHAT I'M GOOD AT.

525
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,301
OUTTALKING THEM,
OUTTHINKING THEM.

526
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,595
IT'S WHAT I AM.

527
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,391
AND I LIKE IT.

528
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,936
I LIKE IT MORE THAN
ANYTHING I'VE EVER DONE.

529
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,943
ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE?

530
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,159
YOU HAVE A SHIT MEMORY.

531
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,123
I AM YOURS
AND YOU ARE MINE.

532
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,333

534
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,142
I HEREBY SEAL
THESE TWO SOULS,

535
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:43,896
BINDING THEM AS ONE

536
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,113
LOOK UPON ONE ANOTHER
AND SAY THE WORDS.

537
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,785
Both:
FATHER, SMITH,

538
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,704
WARRIOR, MOTHER,

539
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:03,332
MAIDEN, CRONE,
STRANGER...

540
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,127
- I AM HERS AND SHE IS MINE...
- I AM HIS AND HE IS MINE...

541
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,797
FROM THIS DAY
UNTIL THE END OF MY DAYS.

542
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:38,242
( speaking Dothraki )

543
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,159
IS THIS A RIDDLE?

544
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,660
KHALEESI!

545
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,413
KHALEESI!

546
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,376
Jorah:
<i>KHALEESI!</i>

547
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,257
ARE YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
WITH MAGIC TRICKS?

548
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,135
YOU WANT ME?
HERE I AM.

549
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,095
ARE YOU AFRAID
OF A LITTLE GIRL?

550
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,682
<i>( dragons screeching )</i>

551
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,354

553
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,981
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

554
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,775
WAITING FOR YOU.

555
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,402
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE'D COME THIS WAY?

556
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,321
AFTER ALL THE THINGS
YOU HAVE SEEN,

557
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,323
THIS IS YOUR QUESTION?

558
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,992
HOW DID YOU
KILL THOSE GUARDS?

559
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,536
WAS IT HARD?

560
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,331
NO HARDER
THAN TAKING A NEW NAME
IF YOU KNOW THE WAY.

561
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,918
SHOW ME HOW.
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO DO IT, TOO.

562
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,045
IF YOU WOULD LEARN,
YOU MUST COME WITH ME.

563
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,672
WHERE?

564
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,008
FAR AND AWAY ACROSS
THE NARROW SEA TO BRAAVOS.

565
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,969
MY DANCING MASTER
WAS FROM BRAAVOS.

566
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,679
( chuckles )

567
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,263
TO BE A DANCING MASTER
IS A SPECIAL THING,

568
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,016
BUT TO BE A FACELESS MAN--

569
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,977
THAT IS SOMETHING
ELSE ENTIRELY.

570
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,271
A GIRL HAS MANY NAMES
ON HER LIPS--

571
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,441
JOFFREY, CERSEI,
TYWIN LANNISTER,

572
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,485
ILYN PAYNE, THE HOUND.

573
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,863
NAMES TO OFFER UP
TO THE RED GOD.

574
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,659
SHE COULD OFFER THEM ALL
ONE BY ONE.

575
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,997
I WANT TO.

576
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,918
BUT I CAN'T.

577
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,088
I NEED TO FIND
MY BROTHER AND MOTHER.

578
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,882
AND MY SISTER.

579
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,469
I NEED TO FIND
HER, TOO.

580
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,306
THEN WE MUST PART.

581
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,433
A MAN HAS DUTIES AS WELL.

582
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,976
HERE.

583
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,936
WHAT IS IT?

584
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,981
A COIN OF GREAT VALUE.

585
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,483
COULD IT BUY A HORSE?

586
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,528
IT IS NOT MEANT
FOR THE BUYING OF HORSES.

587
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,071
THEN WHAT GOOD IS IT?

588
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,907
IF THE DAY COMES WHEN
YOU MUST FIND ME AGAIN,

589
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,909
JUST GIVE THAT COIN
TO ANY MAN FROM BRAAVOS

590
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,619
AND SAY THESE WORDS TO HIM,

591
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,705
"VALAR MORGHULIS."

592
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,291
VALAR MORGHULIS.

593
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,922
PLEASE DON'T GO, JAQEN.

594
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,219
JAQEN IS DEAD.

595
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,056
SAY IT AGAIN.
VALAR MORGHULIS.

596
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,517
VALAR MORGHULIS.

597
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,603
GOOD.

598
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,612
FAREWELL, ARYA STARK.

599
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,931
OSHA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

600
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,180
<i>( wolves whining )</i>

602
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,392
TELL US WHAT MEDICINE
TO GET FROM YOUR CHAMBERS.

603
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:21,145
- WE'LL MAKE YOU BETTER.
- I FEEL JUST FINE.

604
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,401
THEY BURNED IT DOWN.
THEY BURNED EVERYTHING.

605
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:30,988
NOT EVERYTHING.
NOT YOU.

606
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,574

607
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,826
BUT THEY MAY COME BACK.
YOU HAVE TO GO.

608
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,620
PUT ON YOUR
WARMEST CLOTHES.

609
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,080
PACK AS MUCH FOOD AS YOU
CAN CARRY AND GO NORTH.

610
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,082
Osha:
NORTH'S THE WRONG WAY.

611
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,084
THEIR MOTHER AND BROTHER
ARE SOUTH.

612
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,003
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE.

613
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,881
THERE ARE TOO MANY ENEMIES
IN THE SOUTH.

614
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,091
GO TO THE WALL
TO JON.

615
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,802
<i>HE'LL LOOK AFTER YOU</i>
<i>AND LET YOUR MOTHER</i>
<i>KNOW YOU'RE SAFE.</i>

616
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,680
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU.

617
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,433
NO MORE THAN I WANT
TO LEAVE YOU.

618
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,270
I PULLED YOU
INTO THE WORLD.

619
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,939
BOTH OF YOU.

620
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,442
I'VE SEEN BOTH YOUR FACES
ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE.

621
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:13,447
AND FOR THAT, I CONSIDER
MYSELF VERY, VERY LUCKY.

622
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,533
GO NOW WITH HODOR.

623
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,619

OSHA.

627
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,633
YOU MUST PROTECT THEM.

628
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,302
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN.

629
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,808
YOU MAY HAVE TO PROTECT
THEM AGAINST YOUR OWN KIND.

630
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,560
I'VE GOT NO GREAT LOVE
FOR MY OWN KIND.

632
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,440
I'LL GET YOU MILK

MILK OF THE POPPY.
