1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Nothing.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,680
There's gotta be some spell,
some potion,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,840
something to give us the power

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,240
so we can touch the Loom
without turning extra-crispy.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,280
There's also the question
of who's gonna use it with me.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,760
The Loom requires three weavers
who are as powerful as Gods.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I'm not leaving my mom's life
in the hands of you idiots.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,280
Wow. Okay, well, that's one person.
What do you think, Sara?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm already a blind time-traveling
Paragon who can see the future.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,000
So, might as well just add
wannabe God to the list.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,360
Speaking of which,

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,080
can you use your Sara-Vision
to tell me

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
if what I need is in this book?

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,000
Nothing there. You know,
you could just read the book.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,680
You know I would do anything
to save Behrad, but this is faster.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,360
These are all the spell books
in the manor you asked for.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,520
Yes, you're a good man, Gary.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,600
And these...

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,000
are for you.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,400
Can you just give them to me?

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Thank you.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
- Shouldn't you be resting?
- Shouldn't you get out of my face?

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,040
- Yeah.
- No, he's right, love.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,880
Getting some rest
wouldn't be a bad thing.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,080
Not gonna happen.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Look, the sooner we find
this magical cure-all,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,480
then the sooner we can use the Loom
and get my sight back.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
Wait, wait, wait. This book says

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,400
that Merlin used
the Philosopher's Stone.

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
That thing's as real as Santa.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Gary's in the room.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,440
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait.

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
The Chalice of Dionysus.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
It says here that the Chalice was
gifted to an Olympian, Dionysus,

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
by his father, Zeus.

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,760
Whoever drinks from it becomes a God.

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
But only for a day.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,840
Look, don't get your hopes up,
all right?

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,160
The Olympians fed off devotion,

40
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,400
so once they lost their followers,
they just died off,

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,840
and their enchanted objects.

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Lost to time.

43
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I've seen that.

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,800
I've seen that.
I've seen that in college.

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,520
Okay, your degree
is finally paying off.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,160
What class did you see it in?

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,560
That was not in a class.

48
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,960
<i>It's called the Chug Cup.</i>

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Chug! Chug! Chug!

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>Right, campus legend said
that whoever drank from it</i>

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,280
<i>became invincible for a day.</i>

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,200
<i>Now, I went to a rival school,</i>

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,320
<i>so the only way I could get a taste
of it is if we, you know...</i>

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
- Hey!
- Drink.

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Who's that?

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,400
Hudson sucks, Brixton rules!

59
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah!

60
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Stole it.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,000
We really think
that Dionysus' Chalice

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
- is with bunch of frat boys?
- Yes.

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,480
<i>A scan of social media
confirms that a Chalice</i>

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,880
<i>matching that of Dionysus
is currently in possession</i>

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,800
<i>of the Sigma Psi Phi fraternity
at Hudson University.</i>

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
So, we get that,
I become immortal, use the Loom,

67
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,040
and I can forget
I ever knew you people.

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Well, then, Legends,

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,840
you better get your togas dry-cleaned
because we are going Greek.

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
So, babe, all right.

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
{\an5}Every year, the Chug Cup
is presented at the student fair.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
And then, apparently,
fraternities and sororities

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
{\an5}compete for the right to drink in it
in something

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,160
called the Chug Challenge.

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,560
{\an5}Definitely our best place
to try to steal the Chalice.

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Truth.

77
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay, I can get around the ship,

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
but I'm not so sure
about navigating my way

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
through a bunch
of drunk college kids, so...

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
- You got this.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,800
Team loves you. Don't worry.

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,240
{\an5}Okay, I'm not... I'm not really
worried about them accepting me.

83
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
The college kids,
on the other hand...

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Hi, Aunt Ava, Sara.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,880
{\an5}Lita, honey, I am so, so glad
that you're still here.

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
I need you to help me with something.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,720
What are the, like,
kids into these days?

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,000
{\an5}Like, I need them to think I'm cool.

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
{\an5}- Mission's at Hudson U.
- Yeah.

90
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,120
Oh, my guidance counselor
told me to apply there.

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
- Sweetie, that's amazing.
- I can't afford it.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,040
You should do it.

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,400
If you want to do it,
I can make it happen.

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Yeah, I mean,
it could be cool to take a tour.

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,240
We're here, right?

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,280
{\an5}Yeah, yeah. The mission's all good.
Rory, you should definitely do that.

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Okay. Thanks.

98
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,400
If you want kids to think
you're cool, I wouldn't wear that.

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
They're gonna think
you look like a narc.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm... What...

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
When Sisters.

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,440
9 12

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,680
{\an5}Welcome to Hudson University.

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
You smell that?

105
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,360
That smells like the good ol' days.

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
I've had it. I can't breathe in here.

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Maybe it was for the better.
What is that smell?

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,280
{\an5}Okay, so the Sigmas hosted the games.
We find them, we find the cup.

109
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,000
{\an5}Great. Let's fan out.
Zari, thank you.

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,240
Nate, take up the north end.

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
{\an5}Thank you.
Astra, Charlie, you guys...

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,800
{\an5}Let's just find this Chalice,
so we can get this over with.

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
I wasn't finished, but...

114
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
{\an5}- I'll go after her.
- Thank you.

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Pledge Theta. Find your girl gang.

116
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,480
{\an5}Maybe you can tell me where
I can find the Chalice of Dionysus.

117
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,000
{\an5}Sorry, we're just really excited
about the Chug Challenge.

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
Why are we even doing this?

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
We should just take it by force.

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,440
{\an5}Listen to me.
In order to use the Loom,

121
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
{\an5}the weavers have to be in sync.

122
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
Now, I'm not gonna let you use it

123
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,960
unless you can prove
that you can work as a team.

124
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Let me?

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,800
{\an5}I left Hell because I was done
working for a Fate.

126
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,600
{\an5}And that was Quincy Hall,
our economics building.

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,960
{\an5}Hudson has the top program
in the country.

128
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,680
- Did you hear that, Henry?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,840
He's majoring in finance.

130
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,960
I told him, you have to go to Hudson.

131
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,600
You know
that's not the only reason, Gene.

132
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Guilty.

133
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,480
I want him to follow
in Dad's footsteps.

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm an alumnus,
you probably noticed the scarf.

135
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,720
I'd like to wring your neck with it.

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
What was that?

138
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I said...

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
{\an5}I said it's a great building.

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,920
{\an5}Good brick structure, fire-resistant.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,880
Oh, you really know your
architecture.

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
- Where did you study?
- Iron Heights.

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Haven't heard of it.

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,680
It's a super prestigious art school.

145
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah.

146
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Just go with it.

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
I can't believe I'm back here.

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
They used to call me Shotgun Nate.

149
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
I think I know why, but why?

150
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Is that true, Pops?

151
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,160
Show us what you got.

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Pops?

153
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
Pops. Pops.

154
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Pops.

155
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
And I also turn to steel.

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Okay, come on, Grandpa.

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
{\an5}- We gotta keep looking.
- Yeah.

158
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,680
Sigma Psi Phi! Sigma Psi Phi!

159
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

160
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

161
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
Ava, I think we found the Sigmas.

162
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
Ava? Hello?

163
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,360
Bake

164
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm on my way.

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi! Sigma Psi Phi!

166
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,240
{\an5}That was just like my entrance
to the 2044 VMAs.

167
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,720
What's up, Hudson hedonists?

168
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,440
Welcome to the Chug Challenge's
pre-game!

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
- That's the Chalice.
- Wait, wait, wait.

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,200
That's Dion.

171
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,960
He was the head of the Sigmas
when I was in school.

172
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,360
The guy hasn't aged a day.

173
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
We have so much in common.

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,760
Dude, that's because your Dion
is Dionysus.

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
This is the Greek God of wine
and revelry.

176
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
God, the guy's a riot, honestly.

177
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,560
Now, as chug keeper,

178
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,240
I get the honor of announcing
our 2020 Challenges.

179
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,560
I will reveal the first round tonight
at the Sigma rager.

180
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,200
Now let the Challenge begin!

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
Look, just leave this to me,
all right?

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oi, Dion.

183
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Or should I say, Dionysus.

184
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,720
- It's me, Clotho.
- Clotho?

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,600
- Yes.
- Damn, it's really you.

186
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,880
My God.

187
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,400
The Loombreaker is in the house!

188
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Dude, back before people had
free will,

189
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
the Gods were always reining
in the party.

190
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
But look at me now.

191
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,280
You're in college.

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah, I know. I'm a lifer.

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,160
I found a place where the party
doesn't stop,

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
and I haven't left since.

195
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
Honestly, they worship me here,

196
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,360
and they don't even know
that I'm the party God.

197
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,120
- Hey, listen, man...
- Yeah.

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,800
I kind of wanted
to ask a little favor of you.

199
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah, anything
for the Loombreaker, and...

200
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,680
- Sick, is this your squad?
- Yeah.

201
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they call me Shotgun Nate.

202
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,880
- I went to Brixton, but...
- All right, enough of this.

203
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Hey.

204
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,280
So, that's why you're really here.

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,800
Wanted to give your gang
a little taste of immortality.

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Is that what it is?
Well, here's the thing.

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,000
To pick this up, you gotta be Greek,
and I gotta deem you worthy.

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay, how are we supposed to do that?

209
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Good question.
You gotta either join a sorority,

210
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,720
a fraternity or a frorority,
and you gotta win the Chug Challenge.

211
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,080
This is ridiculous.

212
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
And that's what makes it fun.

213
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
See you, Clotho.

214
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
He's still so...

215
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,160
Just stop. I need to focus.

216
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
I need to think of something.

217
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
- I have an idea.
- No.

218
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,800
Something that does not involve
maiming.

219
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,680
OAP

220
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,240
Since the Chalice belongs to Dion,
we've gotta follow his rules.

221
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
You guys, we're gonna win that cup.

222
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
So, what you're saying
is in order to use the Loom of Fate,

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,960
we have to join a sorority?

224
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Finally. A mission I can get behind.

225
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Luckily for us, the Thetas
are hosting a pledge social today.

226
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,680
This cannot be your plan.

227
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Look, as long as Dion's got the cup,
we've gotta play by his rules.

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,040
Counterpoint. You don't get anywhere
playing by the rules.

229
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh, really? Because I think
I was about to win him over

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
before you tried to nab the cup.

231
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
Hey, okay.

232
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,760
So, who wants to rush
Theta Lambda Rho?

233
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,680
- No, no, no. Just stop.
- No.

234
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,560
Charlie, Astra, you'll pledge Theta.

235
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Just try to remember
you're on the same side, yeah?

236
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Yeah.

237
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah. Sure we are.

238
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
She's exhausting.

239
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,600
So, I'm doing track and debate,
plus my dad got me this internship.

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,440
What are your extracurriculars?

241
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,760
I was in band for a while, but I quit

242
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,800
because no one else wanted
to play The Replacements.

243
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,080
And I have a part-time job.

244
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I heard that helps.

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,000
Actually, to get into a place
like this,

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,360
you'll really want to build out
your application.

247
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
And here we are at Neuman Hall.

248
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
The name might sound familiar
to some families on this tour.

249
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,440
Oh, Henry Neuman.

250
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,120
This is actually
my grandfather's building,

251
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,560
which should help my chances
of getting in here.

252
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Hey, hope I didn't miss
too much of the tour.

253
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,480
Just to be super clear,
I'm not a prospective student.

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,280
Okay, my name is Dr. Nate Heywood.

255
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,520
I got my PhD from Brixton.

256
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Go, Big Red.

257
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
- Oh, a doctor.
- Yeah.

258
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
And Lita's dad.

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
- What?
- What?

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
Just go with it.

261
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,600
Thank you for your enquiry.
I think it's really important...

262
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,880
- Hi, how's it going?
- Be yourself.

263
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Hi.

264
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,960
I can't believe we are this close
to becoming Thetas.

265
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,520
I don't even know you,
but we could be sisters.

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm only here as a performance.

267
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Notice my empty teacup,

268
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,600
a commentary on the emptiness
of this charade.

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, my God.
We should start a group text.

270
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
What are your numbers?

271
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,760
Welcome to the Theta luncheon.

272
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,840
Everybody, look around you.

273
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,120
This could be your new family,

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,360
the ones you turn to for support,
sisterhood, guidance.

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,160
That is, as long as you make the cut.

276
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,880
So, bid Theta.

277
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
For real?

278
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
What are you doing?

279
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,440
Come on, we gotta try and convince
these people, no matter what.

280
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,720
Now, just try and fit in, please.

281
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,920
Fine. You want me to fit in?

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,320
Waiter, replace this drink.

283
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,440
If I wanted weak tea, I'd rush Omega.

284
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
This girl's fire. I like that.

285
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
We're gonna start with your table.

286
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,960
This here is the house paddle,
our most sacred object.

287
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm going to ask a question,

288
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,160
and when you're holding the paddle,
it's your turn to answer.

289
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Okay?

290
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,640
What did you do before college?

291
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
So, I grew up in Hell,

292
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,840
had minions do my bidding
and rose to power

293
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,560
until I practically ran the place.

294
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, and she's ambitious.

295
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,080
- Now you go.
- Okay.

296
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,800
Well, I traveled around the world
with a bunch of friends.

297
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
More like rejects.

298
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
But before that, I was actually
in this really cool punk band.

299
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Yeah, Thetas don't really do punk.

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,920
Yeah, I know her type.

301
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,680
You pretend like you're
all about bucking the system,

302
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,080
and then you get pissed when people
don't fall in line behind you.

303
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,960
You think you're better
than the sisters you ran away from,

304
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
but the truth is...

305
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,480
you're all the same.

306
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
That's a little bit rich, isn't it?

307
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Coming from my sister's lapdog.

308
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
No.

309
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
No.

310
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,280
Theta, no.

311
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,520
You know what?

312
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,640
This whole table is exiled.

313
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,280
None of you are Theta material.

314
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,880
How'd the mission go?
You immortal sorority girls yet?

315
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,560
I need a drink.

316
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,440
The refreshing sound of failure.

317
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480
We would be well on our way
to using the Loom right now

318
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,520
if someone hadn't blown it.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,200
Our cover was blown because you
decided to go Hell mode on us.

320
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,960
Oh, you think that was Hell mode?
Honey...

321
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,560
Call me honey again.
Go on, I dare you.

322
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,280
Try me
and you'll wish you were immortal.

323
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

324
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
No one's killing anyone.

325
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,880
Astra was definitely gonna go for it.

326
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
Zari, hide that fork.

327
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,880
Charlie, just chill. Please sit down.

328
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Just take a breath, yeah?

329
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
All right. You good?

330
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Okay.

331
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,120
All right, we need to find
another way to get the Chalice.

332
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,480
You can't defy a God.

333
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
We have to win as a sorority.

334
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,080
And with no sorority...

335
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
- We're screwed.
- Yeah.

336
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,960
Ladies, we're gonna start our own.

337
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,480
I can't tell, is she serious?

338
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,760
I think so.

339
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,000
Becoming an official sorority
by tonight?

340
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
I mean, the paperwork alone would...

341
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

342
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Why not?

343
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I really should've killed you all
when I had the chance.

344
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,040
Go, sisters.

345
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
We'll get there.

346
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
B

347
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
- Do you think my dad's okay?
- Oh, yeah.

348
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
He comes and goes as he pleases.

349
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,400
It's really part of his charm.

350
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,360
Bright side is I get to show you
what college is all about.

351
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,200
This is Greek Row.

352
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,960
This is where the fraternities
and the sororities live.

353
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,680
They're the most influential people
on campus.

354
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
These are the guys
that have the Chalice?

355
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Wish I could be more impressed.

356
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Yeah.

357
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,840
Call the Bro Patrol.

358
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,680
- Looks like somebody wants to party.
- Is he talking to us?

359
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
- Act cool. Be cool. Shut up.
- I don't...

360
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,160
This is Agent Heywood to Bro Patrol.

361
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,680
Desire to party confirmed.

362
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,480
- How cool was that?
- Do you have a man-crush?

363
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,000
- No. It's unrequited.
- It's okay.

364
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
- You should tell him.
- Shut up.

365
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,240
Super-stoked that you're here.

366
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,520
Anyone who's a friend
of the Loombreaker is chill with me.

367
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,000
So snag some bags and some brews.

368
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,440
Oh, and fear not, we have energy
drinks for the little ones.

369
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,120
It's all peers,
no pressure at Casa de Sigma.

370
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I want to say that's tight,
but, I got responsibilities.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,360
Well, hey, come by anytime,
and we'll party like it's 1999.

372
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Wait, hold on.

373
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,680
You said these are the guys
that have the Chalice, right?

374
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,800
So, why don't you go inside
and get requited,

375
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
and I can do some scouting
and find out where they keep it.

376
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
Only if your dad doesn't try to set
me on fire while I'm asleep.

377
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,760
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal.

378
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,960
All right, so what are we doing?
League rules?

379
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,640
All right, two points
for those overhangs!

380
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Okay, I call to order the charter
meeting of Delta Chi Sigma,

381
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,960
Sisterhood of Legends.

382
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,240
Let's make a sorority.

383
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,080
First up, we need a house.

384
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,360
I say we steal the Thetas' place.

385
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
You disable
the carbon monoxide detector,

386
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,080
I'll go in, cut the power...

387
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,080
Or I have a more non-fatal idea.

388
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,120
There's a place that's been empty
since Pi Epsilon's last rager.

389
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,120
Something about a de-Jell-O-ing?

390
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,840
- Oh, that is really foul.
- Yeah.

391
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
But with a little trickery,

392
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,840
I'll just open up a portal,
instant remodel.

393
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
They'll never know the difference.

394
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

395
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,680
It's not my fault you can't resist
my effortless charms.

396
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Obviously,
we're gonna have to redecorate.

397
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Well, you lot have fun.

398
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,600
I can't bear
to watch you desecrate this place.

399
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,080
Oh, and watch out for these bad boys.

400
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
They bite.

401
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
So do I.

402
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,880
Okay, so, in order
to be an official sorority,

403
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
we need three more sisters.

404
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,920
And if we wanna win that Chalice,
they gotta be good.

405
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,480
So, Gideon, what do you got?

406
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,440
<i>Inez Martin was voted out of pep
squad for being too enthusiastic.</i>

407
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,440
Hey. How's it going? What's up?

408
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,000
Hi. Hey, there.

409
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,000
- Oh, Inez, right?
- Yes.

410
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,520
This is weird, but I was just
wondering if you wanted to join...

411
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Definitely.

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
- You don't even know what I...
- It doesn't matter.

413
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Where can I meet you?

414
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,600
<i>Lisa Lindhome. Aspiring influencer,</i>

415
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,000
<i>shunned after becoming the subject
of a viral video</i>

416
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,480
<i>entitled Girl Snarts at Party.</i>

417
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Wait.

418
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,560
What is a snart?

419
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,160
- It's when you sneeze and...
- And let's not.

420
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,680
Let's just ease Astra
back onto Earth, all right?

421
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Fair.

422
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,440
<i>Silvia Hines created
her own major in performance art.</i>

423
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,160
You're the ones who tried
to kill each other at the tea party.

424
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,480
Yeah, about that.

425
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
We've actually started
our own sorority and...

426
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,880
What is the point of partying
with a bunch of brain-dead wasteoids?

427
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I get it.

428
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,880
Seems impossible
to feel any kind of power in a cruel,

429
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,360
dying world, right?

430
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
But have you considered
that winning the masses

431
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,120
over with the illusion of fun

432
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,920
might be the perfect way to ply them
to do your bidding?

433
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm in.

434
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,240
<i>Unfortunately, Captain,
the pool of Theta rejects is slim.</i>

435
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- I like 'em.

436
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,840
We chose you
because we know what it's like,

437
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,600
looking for a place to belong.

438
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,800
Because we, too,
were there at your age.

439
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,520
That's why we've created that place.

440
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,000
And as of today, you are Deltas.

441
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,800
Welcome to the sisterhood.

442
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,920
- Wait, are you blind?
- Yes.

443
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,960
I love it. Deltas are so inclusive.

444
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,440
But don't we need a motto?

445
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
We can't do anything without a motto.

446
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,480
Yeah. The sisters...

447
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,960
Are the glue.

448
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,360
Glue that greases the wheels of...

449
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
time.

450
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
That doesn't make any sense.

451
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
It's called avant-garde.

452
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
What about...

453
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,320
we might not have it all together,
but together we have it all?

454
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Okay, I need that on a T-shirt,
like, now.

455
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,680
- Okay, go, sisters.
- Sisters.

456
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,960
Sisters.

457
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm telling you, I can take it.

458
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Dude, it's 2020.

459
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,480
We don't do that anymore.

460
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,920
- Just do it.
- Yeah.

461
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,600
It's like his ass is made of steel.

462
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
Because it is.

463
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Keg's here, D.

464
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,320
Hey. So glad that you found us.

465
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
I knew that you had bro-tential
the second I saw you.

466
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,120
- That's nice of you.
- I wanted to mark the occasion.

467
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
It's my special stash.

468
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,600
I brew it out back.
I hope you like IPAs.

469
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,640
Bro, I am all about the IPAs.

470
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,040
- Yeah?
- You mind?

471
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,080
- My man.
- So good.

472
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,680
- Yeah, that brew right there,
- Yeah.

473
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,480
honestly, will just take you back
to the glory days.

474
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Make you forget all about that stupid
and stressful world out there.

475
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,200
- Honestly, it's magic, bro.
- Yeah.

476
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,480
I, I just need to check up.

477
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
I feel awesome.

478
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
- I knew you would.
- Thank you.

479
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,280
- Hey, I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

480
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
Why did you and your friends
really end up here, of all places?

481
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,160
Oh, man, they're cool.

482
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,520
We just wanted to take your Chalice,
so we can use the Loom of Fate.

483
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,120
Are you saying that the Loombreaker
is a Loomfaker?

484
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,440
Bro, you're a looker and a cooker.

485
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,800
Right, but she puts
that Loom together...

486
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,160
I mean, there, there goes free will.

487
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
There goes the party.

488
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
God.

489
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,080
And that is very not tight.

490
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,800
<i>Our name is Delta Chi Sigma.</i>

491
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,680
<i>We've assembled
an elite team of women...</i>

492
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
<i>to save this campus
from the cliques and cruelty</i>

493
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
<i>of the common Greek house.</i>

494
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,280
<i>And together,
we will display true sisterhood.</i>

495
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
<i>And win the Chug Challenge.</i>

496
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,960
Ready and throw.

497
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,360
<i>And then...</i>

498
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
<i>Party.</i>

499
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,560
<i>But please, don't call us heroes.</i>

500
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,160
Call us Deltas.

501
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,760
And... post.

502
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,160
All right, we are officially a part
of the Chug Challenge.

503
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,680
- Yeah.
- This should scare the competition.

504
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,640
Yeah, and put us well on track
to using the Loom.

505
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay, I think this calls
for a snack party.

506
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Who wants nachos?

507
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
It's my brother's special recipe.

508
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,320
Hey, I just wanted to say thank you.

509
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,760
I've just always been so focused
on changing the world at all costs

510
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,520
that I just push people away.

511
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,960
So... thanks.

512
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,560
Oh, I mean,
they're really the ones who...

513
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
thank you.

514
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Loom or no Loom,
at least some things are changing.

515
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,400
I can still put a stiletto
through your head.

516
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,320
But your plan does seem
to be working.

517
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,480
I still think it's the stupidest way
to get what we want, but...

518
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
'Sup, ladies?

519
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
Heard there was a new sorority
on the block.

520
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,880
Had to come and hit y'all
with that Big D welcome.

521
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
What?

522
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,360
You guys tricked out this place.

523
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,320
Gargoyles in sunglasses? Sick.

524
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,560
So sick.

525
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,240
- Nate, what the hell are you...
- No, it's Shotgun Nate.

526
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,480
You guys have got to come to Dion's.

527
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,760
I mean, it makes me wonder
why I ever left college.

528
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,520
Dionysus has the power to put people
in a constant state of ecstasy.

529
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,760
- Nate's under his spell.
- You mean Shotgun Nate.

530
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,400
Yeah, we're gonna go train
for your dumb challenge,

531
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,000
so go bother some other house.

532
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
Oh, right.

533
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,160
I'm not here
just to meet the new neighbors.

534
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,960
I also wanted to tell you...

535
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,160
that you're disqualified
from the Chug Challenges.

536
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,440
There's no way you're getting
that Chalice.

537
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,680
The hell are you on about?

538
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
Shotgun told me
why you're really here.

539
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,720
And the thing is, I just can't
have you using that Loom.

540
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,320
Thing's a total buzzkill.

541
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,280
We did everything you said,
played by every stupid rule.

542
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,640
You can't just change them on us now.

543
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
Well, yeah, I can.

544
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,600
I mean,
who says that you have to play fair?

545
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm a God.

546
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
I just gotta keep it whimsical, bro.

547
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,280
Let's roll.

548
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
Whimsy! Whimsy!

549
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,240
Whimsy! Whimsy! Whimsy!
Whimsy! Whimsy!

550
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,720
Who was at the door? What's wrong?

551
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,320
We're not getting the Chalice,
that's what.

552
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,640
Dion's refusing to let us participate
in the challenges.

553
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,640
He somehow got to Nate,
figured out what we're doing.

554
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,400
Of course he did.

555
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
It's okay, we will figure this out.

556
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,200
I am done trying to figure this out
with you people.

557
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,160
I should've done this my way
from the start,

558
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,080
so I'm taking that Chalice by force.

559
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,600
Look, even if you tried,
that won't work.

560
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
You can't defy a God.

561
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,200
And there is no way you're using
the Loom on your own.

562
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,600
Being a grown-up sounds weird.

563
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,000
If I can't get Dion's cup,
I can at least make him suffer.

564
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,240
Him and all his bros,

565
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,480
including your
hyp-bro-tized friend, Nate.

566
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,480
Hold on a minute. You can't do that.

567
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
We're a sisterhood, remember?

568
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,120
You can stop feeding me
that line right now.

569
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,400
You pretend we're sisters,

570
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
but all you do
is expect me to change.

571
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm only your sister
if I become more like you.

572
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,760
- Astra, calm down, that's not...
- You never listen to my ideas,

573
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,400
and I see how you all look at me.

574
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,440
I might be new to this,
but that is not sisterhood,

575
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,960
and I am done trying to fit in.

576
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,640
- Hey, got your text.
- Hey.

577
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Where were you?

578
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
Trying to get you into this place.

579
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
What do you think?

580
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,640
What? Dad, how'd you do this?

581
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,600
Went back in time. Donated.

582
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
You're as good as in.

583
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Thank you,
but I didn't really need a building.

584
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,000
I just needed you here.

585
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,560
Well, I thought you were embarrassed
to be with me.

586
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,480
I don't belong with these people.

587
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
I didn't want to ruin your chances.

588
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,440
I'm sorry, it wasn't about you.
I was just ashamed of me.

589
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,480
What are you talking about?

590
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,760
Don't be stupid. You're great.

591
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,240
Yeah, but I don't belong
with them either.

592
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
I mean, the only reason
that I survived high school

593
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
was because I was imagining

594
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,800
that one day I would get out
and find my people.

595
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,960
They're never gonna take me
as one of them.

596
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,160
I don't really want to be.

597
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,760
You don't have to impress
these idiots, these leeches.

598
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,640
You're twice the person
they'd ever be.

599
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,800
Yeah, but so are you.

600
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,680
I mean, you fought a demon dog.

601
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,360
And these people think
that they're better than us

602
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
because they have whales
on their shorts?

603
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,680
What do you say we find a way
to piss off some rich kids?

604
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
I like the sound of that.

605
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Give me that.

606
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,560
Wait, Astra, no, no, no.
You don't have to do this.

607
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,080
I am done listening to you.

608
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,320
Fine, then don't listen to me.

609
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,480
Listen to yourself.

610
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,480
Come on, you know this isn't right.

611
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,600
Yeah, that's the thing,
I don't know that.

612
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,040
Where I'm from,
I had to fight to survive.

613
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,040
This is all I know.
This is what life has made me.

614
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,320
I am not gonna change.

615
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,040
Blimey, no, we don't want you
to give up who you are.

616
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,960
Look, when I joined the Legends,
I was a punk.

617
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,080
All right? And there wasn't a rule
that I couldn't break.

618
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,680
And guess what? I still am.

619
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,720
I just don't need to hurt people
to survive anymore,

620
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,880
because I have them.

621
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Fine, so I don't burn down a house.

622
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
But what if I never wanna dress
as a moose,

623
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,040
or sit through one
of your interminable team meetings?

624
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,000
Then we've still got a place for you.

625
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,840
Did you come to party down?

626
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,160
No, we've come
to get the Chalice and you.

627
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,960
- Come on, Nate, you can't stay here.
- Sure, I can.

628
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,960
Dion says
as long as he has followers,

629
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,360
he has the power to run this place
and grant people that cup.

630
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,360
Thought that'd be useful information
for you.

631
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,160
Can't really remember why.

632
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,640
Either way, I'm very important here,
so excuse me.

633
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,120
Shotgun Nate!

634
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
Shotgun Nate!

635
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,480
- Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!
- Wait.

636
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
Shotgun Nate!

637
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,200
The Olympians feed off devotion,
right?

638
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
So that means that Dion
only has his followers

639
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,920
for as long as they worship him
as the party God.

640
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,080
So, if we take away
all these followers from him,

641
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,760
that's it, the Chalice is released
from his grasp.

642
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,440
Okay, but the party
isn't slowing down.

643
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,480
No, but there is one way
to get college kids to leave a party.

644
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,240
Oh, wait, no, no, please don't say...

645
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,800
And that is to throw
an even bigger party.

646
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,040
Which means.

647
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,800
- What is wrong with you people?
- Come on.

648
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,840
The Deltas
have got to out-party Dionysus.

649
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,080
I am still in Hell, aren't I?

650
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Come on.

651
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
2739

652
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,680
I can't believe it.
Delta's very first house party.

653
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,440
You know, I'm actually excited.
I get it now.

654
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,160
Parties aren't just
about getting drunk.

655
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
They're about building community.

656
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,400
This is so much better
than just some frat party.

657
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Yeah, it would be
if anyone were here to see it.

658
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,440
- So, where is everybody?
- You know what? I think I know.

659
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,480
I don't know why we thought
we could out-party Dion.

660
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,480
You know what? Let's not give up yet.

661
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,840
Why not?
We have drinks, games, music.

662
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,680
We did everything
we were supposed to,

663
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,360
and no one came.

664
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
That's right.

665
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,920
We did everything
that we were supposed to.

666
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,960
But maybe we should ask ourselves,
what would Astra do?

667
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
If you really want to win,

668
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
it is not enough to be good
at your own game.

669
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,480
You also have to take
out the competition.

670
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,320
So, I am talking...

671
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,720
- sabotage.
- Yeah.

672
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,040
All right, what's the plan?

673
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,320
First, we take Dion out of play.

674
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,720
Now, I scoped out his place
when I was gonna burn it down,

675
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,880
and I have an idea.

676
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
'Sup, Charlie?

677
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,520
- Big D!
- Yeah.

678
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,480
Now that I got my team out
of your hair,

679
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,000
how about we get
a fresh keg and celebrate?

680
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,160
I like how you think, Shotgun.

681
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,400
<i>Once he's out,
we mess with his party.</i>

682
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,040
<i>Anything we can do to kill the vibe.</i>

683
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,280
Hacking into Dion's accounts and...

684
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>Buh-bye, party playlist.</i>

685
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,680
Hey. Who cut the music?

686
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
What the hell is this?

687
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,720
<i>Then we take out his booze.</i>

688
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,520
And this is where
all the magic happens.

689
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,480
So, are these all lagers?

690
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm sorry, bro.

691
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,520
No hard feelings, yeah?

692
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Dad, now!

693
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,480
And now the keg is tapped.

694
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,000
So, final phase, hijack the party.

695
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,480
Hey, guys, I heard there's a rager
at Delta Chi Sigma.

696
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,120
So, what are we waiting for?

697
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Let's go party.

698
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,480
I gotta say it,
you Legends do know how to party.

699
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,800
Rory, are you able
to lift the Chalice yet?

700
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,560
It's still not giving.

701
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,160
That doesn't make sense.

702
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,160
All of his followers are here.

703
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,680
Cool little trick you pulled
back there.

704
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,680
Gotta appreciate a good stunt.

705
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,200
Still, I heard there was a party
that I wasn't invited to,

706
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,120
and that hurts.

707
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,760
We're getting that Chalice, Dion.

708
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,400
As long as I have my followers,
my Chug Cup isn't going anywhere.

709
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,520
And bros are bros for life.

710
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,920
Bros are bros for life!
Bros are bros for life!

711
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,560
Bros are bros for life!

712
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,840
- Bros are bros for life!
- Hey!

713
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,680
Your reign on this campus is over.

714
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,400
I challenge you...

715
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,640
to beer pong.

716
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,120
You do know I'm undefeated
in all my years on campus, right?

717
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,360
Yeah, but it might be pretty hard
to hold on to all your followers

718
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,000
once they watch me demolish you.

719
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,080
So come on, D-Bag.

720
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,720
What do you say?

721
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,360
Winner takes all.

722
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,120
Dartmouth rules.

723
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,240
You know I can't say no
to a challenge.

724
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
Stupid whimsy. You're on.

725
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,680
But if I win,
Delta House gets shut down.

726
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,160
No sorority and no Chug Cup.

727
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,440
Yeah!

728
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,200
You sure about this, babe?

729
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,440
Because, you know, you can't see.

730
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,160
Oh, I've played some beer pong
in my life.

731
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,000
And plus, superpowers, remember?

732
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,880
The game is beer pong.

733
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,160
Now, sink a ball into a cup
and the other player drinks it.

734
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,120
And to make it even more fun,
body saves are fair game.

735
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
So remember, everybody,

736
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,760
the first player to clear
the other's cups takes it all.

737
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,720
Now, opponents, please shake hands.

738
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,760
May the best player win.

739
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Whatever.

740
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
And pong!

741
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,960
Chug!

742
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Chug!

743
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,360
Chug!

744
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Okay.

745
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,160
Chug! Chug! Chug!

746
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Chug!

747
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Yes.

748
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,600
This point wins it.

749
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,120
All right. Let's do this.

750
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sorry, dude.

751
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,320
Yes!

752
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,080
Our winner!

753
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
We gotta give it to her.

754
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,280
Wait, wait, wait.
What happened to Bros for life?

755
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
I...

756
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,560
Come on. I know you wanna say it.

757
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,760
- I will not.
- Come on.

758
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,160
Then I will.

759
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,560
Go, sisters!

760
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Got your cup.

761
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,880
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

762
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
Best father-daughter weekend ever.

763
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,720
I can't believe that actually worked.

764
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,960
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

765
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,760
We couldn't have done it
without the three of you.

766
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,240
Yeah, thanks for sticking with us
even when we were right gits.

767
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,080
It's been real, ladies.

768
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,280
I'm sorry this chapter
of Delta Chi Sigma

769
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,640
has to come to an end.

770
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,760
Oh, it's not over.

771
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,400
We're gonna keep Delta House going.

772
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,120
- What?
- After the party,

773
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,880
I applied for a house on Greek Row.

774
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
Fitting in is hard enough.

775
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
So many people telling you
what to do and what to wear.

776
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,840
Now there's a space for people
to figure it out for themselves.

777
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,280
Thanks to you guys.

778
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
I get it. You're welcome.

779
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,600
- All right, ladies.
- Oi.

780
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,160
- What?
- One for the road?

781
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Go.

782
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,240
Deltas.

783
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,040
- We'll miss you. We'll miss you.
- Say no to drugs, kids.

784
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,000
- Don't do it. It's not worth it.
- Yeah.

785
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I need a nap.

786
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
You guys earned the good stuff.

787
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,920
You won the Chalice and, with it,
immortality for a day.

788
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,960
All right, guess it's time to chug.

789
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,160
To Behrad and to your mum.

790
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,400
Well, it's actually quite a lot
of responsibility, really.

791
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,480
And that is a lot of wine.

792
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,880
Why don't we all just drink from it?

793
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,920
I mean, who says there only has
to be three Fates, right?

794
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
Yeah, we could
all use the Loom together.

795
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah, you're not alone in this, love.

796
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,240
Yeah, immortality sounds pretty epic.

797
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,520
Let's drink.

798
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,480
Let's all do it, then.

799
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,880
- Yeah.
- All right.

800
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah, I'm not gonna drink,
super haram,

801
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,840
but I trust all of you to bring
my baby brother back.

802
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,840
Here goes nothing.

803
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Oh, hey.

804
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
That's it.

805
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,720
Well, not exactly, bro.

806
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,000
You are all glowing.

807
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,760
Oh, must be the moisturizer
you recommended.

808
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,920
My skin feels tighter.

809
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,920
Literally, you're literally glowing.

810
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,400
Guys, we did it.

811
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,160
Come on, let's go and use that Loom.

812
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,600
And remember, no looming anything
that'll ruin my party.

813
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,880
Not that you would, Clotho.

814
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
- I can tell you're still chill.
- That's right.

815
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,840
Later days, Shotgun.

816
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,120
Later days, Dion.

817
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,040
You guys got some trippy art here.

818
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,720
- This cane was yelling at me.
- Yeah.

819
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,560
I'll take that. Nice one, love.

820
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,040
Sounds like someone's had
too much to drink.

821
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,560
Let's get you out of here.

822
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

823
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,960
Wow, I miss it.

824
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,600
Hello, traitor.

825
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,320
Just the woman I wanted to see.

826
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
Don't bother trying to win me back.

827
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,400
I don't need you anymore.

828
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,320
When you asked for my help
killing John Constantine,

829
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,720
I warned you,
you would be in my debt.

830
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,560
Well, honey,
I'm calling in the favor.
