1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,667
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,818
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,040
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,013
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:08,516
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,095
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:13,002
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,171
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

9
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,691
she changed the present.

10
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:20,343
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever.

11
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,696
And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

12
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,282
I am the Flash.

13
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,099
Previously on "The Flash"...

14
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,559
I want to believe that there is good

15
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,979
inside of you somewhere, Thawne.

16
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,564
Let me prove there is.

17
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,608
The shards weren't dampening my powers.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,401
They were removing them.

19
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,361
We could make a meta-human cure.

20
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,881
Earl Cox. Ralph Dibny's gone straight.

21
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:42,578
So when you let your new friends down,

22
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,638
give your old one a call.

23
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,415
So he thinks the kid is hiding out here,

24
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:46,926
just lurking behind those doors.

25
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,969
It's the inside of Dwyer's house.

26
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:50,897
Didn't you have, like, seven marriages?

27
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,285
I did have seven marriages.
Five wives, seven marriages.

28
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,261
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

29
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,598
why you're investigating Nora.

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,966
I've made a career
out of noticing things

31
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,318
that other people miss.

32
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:22,164
Who is your accomplice, Nora West-Allen?

33
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:34,775
There's always a Wells.

34
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,352
He knows I'm working with someone.

35
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:39,397
But he doesn't know
with whom you're working.

36
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,041
- Not yet.
- How can you be sure?

37
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:44,712
Because if he did, your
father would be here

38
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:48,116
right now in a flash,
threatening to put his hand

39
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,000
right through my heart.

40
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,721
Eobard, if my father finds out

41
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:54,983
you've been helping me

42
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:57,298
try to catch Cicada behind his back,

43
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,892
he'll hate me,

44
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:00,728
- and...
- Shh.

45
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,088
This can all be fixed.

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,140
I can fix this.

47
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,591
How?

48
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:12,764
A man... does not
wear another man's face

49
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,392
unless he understands his mind.

50
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:19,988
Not just through time

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,990
but across infinite Earths.

52
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,627
This Sherloque, yes, he's brilliant,

53
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,225
but to redirect his gaze,
one only has to nudge him

54
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:33,585
toward his weakness:

55
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,120
love.

56
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,099
Tell me what to do.

57
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:42,632

58
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,442
Well, what do you think?

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,844
Looks great.

60
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,551
I mean, I can move the
couch against the wall,

61
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,823
if that'll help.

62
00:02:55,826 --> 00:03:00,821
Iris, it's just couch in the
corner or against the wall

63
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:03,532
is pretty much the extent of
my interior design knowledge.

64
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:04,866
I'm sorry, babe.

65
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,608
It's... it's just,
it's been a week since

66
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,986
I launched the Central City Citizen,

67
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,737
and I am still struggling
to gain readers,

68
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,300
and I think I just figured out why.

69
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,785
"Iris West-Allen's
first published articles

70
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,620
as an aspiring online news maven

71
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,714
bring one word to mind:

72
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,541
'boring.'

73
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:24,836
Her stories lack the
edgy content made popular

74
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,106
by sites such as Spencer Young's

75
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,723
game-changing Spyn Zone.

76
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:32,060
In short, Iris West-Allen plays it safe."

77
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:33,904
Iris, come on.

78
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:35,322
You can't listen to this.

79
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:36,973
You're a real journalist.

80
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:38,659
You don't want to write
like Spencer Young.

81
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:39,860
She didn't care about facts.

82
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,236
Yeah, but at least
she wrote about things

83
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:42,729
that people cared about,

84
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,981
like I did when I was
writing about DeVoe.

85
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,667
You wanna write about Cicada.

86
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,338
Fine.

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,822
Call me if you need me.

88
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:54,991
- I'll be at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Yes, of course.

89
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:57,252
I've got a lot of digging to do,

90
00:03:57,254 --> 00:04:00,288
and I think I have a
hunch where to start.

91
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,207
- Mwah.
- All right.

92
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,213
So you really think this might be it?

93
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,673
Cisco sent me this sample
to corroborate his findings,

94
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,113
and it all checks out.

95
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,228
I'm sending it back to
him for final processing,

96
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,695
but I think we may have found a way

97
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:18,030
- to suppress the meta genome.
- Great.

98
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,058
Then we can use it to de-power Cicada,

99
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,726
- stop him for good.
- So what's the plan?

100
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,036
Put this thing in a tranq gun and go all

101
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,613
"American Sniper" on him?

102
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,948
It's not that simple.

103
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,452
So Cisco's breakthrough came
from analyzing identical twins

104
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,617
who were hit by the particle
accelerator dark matter,

105
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,073
cases where one developed
powers and the other didn't.

106
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,158
The key difference in both cases...

107
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,178
- The pituitary gland?
- Exactly.

108
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,454
In some cases, the pituitary gland

109
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:43,557
metabolizes dark
matter, thus manifesting

110
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,139
in meta powers.

111
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,728
So to turn a meta-human
into a human-human...

112
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,348
We neutralize the dark
matter in the pituitary gland.

113
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,924
Except there's one problem.

114
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,093
The cure isn't instant.

115
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,720
We would have to immobilize
Cicada for long enough

116
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:59,195
for the cure to take effect.

117
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,033
- How long will that take?
- Best guess, a minute.

118
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,234
It's gonna be damn near
impossible to hold him still

119
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,061
for one second, much less 60.

120
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,822
Okay, but we're so close.

121
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,616
I mean, there's... there's
gotta be something we can do,

122
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,651
even if we have to
think outside the box.

123
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,921
I do have one more idea.

124
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,456
Van Horn Industries

125
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,926
created a peaceful anti-riot device

126
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,928
called a Neuro-Stasis Field Generator.

127
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,413
It's basically a bio-EMP
that can immobilize

128
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:26,007
any living organism
within a confined radius.

129
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,460
Of course, the few devices
they had built were stolen.

130
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,839
I wouldn't even know where
to begin looking for them.

131
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,632
I do.

132
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,685
Can you at least try
not to look so surprised?

133
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:40,972
Look, if we need this, uh,
Neo-Matrix whatever it is,

134
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,267
if it's stolen tech, I
think I know where to look.

135
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,529
Earl Cox, Ralph says
you've got some information

136
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:47,667
that could help us.

137
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,855
Well, turns out, that
device you're looking for

138
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,701
has been circulating in the
underground black market.

139
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:54,444
Sounds like Amunet Black's territory.

140
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:56,511
Eh, Amunet's still MIA.

141
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,281
But believe it or not, her ex-boyfriend

142
00:05:58,283 --> 00:05:59,967
is filling the void.

143
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,961
You ever heard of Goldface?

144
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,809
Yeah, he's stolen more weaponized tech

145
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,456
than any criminal in the city.

146
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,142
CCPD's been looking for
his black market for years.

147
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,978
Oh, aye, and they'll
keep on coming up empty.

148
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,105
You pay at the market, and then poof,

149
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:16,224
your goods turn up a day later
in an abandoned warehouse.

150
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,235
So by the time we get what we want...

151
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:21,012
Goldface will be long gone.

152
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,489
Well, listen, uh, thanks, Earl.

153
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,350
And, you know, try to eat
some fruit or something.

154
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,518
Oh, will do.

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,237
Right, then, gents. See you around.

156
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,314
Hopefully.

157
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:32,950
Just tell them Big Raf sent you.

158
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,484
Thanks for the tip, Earl.

159
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,331
I know what you're thinking.

160
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,782
We're supposed to pay Goldface

161
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,195
and then just let him get away?

162
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:44,999
Come on, you said we needed
to think outside the box.

163
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,667
This is making a deal with the devil.

164
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,787
No, this is stopping Cicada.

165
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,167
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do,

166
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,595
but in some cases, the
ends justify the means.

167
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,713
And stopping a psychotic
meta-killer who we are

168
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,026
literally powerless against,
that's one of those cases.

169
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,070
All right.

170
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:04,555
What we are doing here?

171
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,016
So Jitters has imported
a brand-new oolong tea,

172
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,393
and it's super rare and I
really want you to try it.

173
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,674
Okay, look, I'm busy right now.

174
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,331
I'm working, all right? I
don't have time for this.

175
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,576
Well, what are you...
What are you working on?

176
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,686
Well, I'm working on a mystery,

177
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,275
if you must know, nosy Parker.

178
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,953
Well, what kind of mystery?

179
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,030
One that maybe I will
tell you before too long,

180
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:23,383
Nora West-Allen.

181
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:26,053
Great, so, um, let's grab a tea, then.

182
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,615
All right, we'll have one cup of tea.

183
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,141
To go.

184
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,586
Tell me what to do.

185
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,127
It's amazing how
malleable the timeline is.

186
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,592
Even the tiniest refinement
can birth a whole new reality,

187
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,905
an object above placed below.

188
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:49,555
One path blocked leads
to a whole new one.

189
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:53,168
And if your timing is right,

190
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,815
everything falls into place.

191
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:05,283
Keep the change.

192
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,969
Whoo! Oh!

193
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:11,747
Oh!

194
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,833
- Wow.
- Wow.

195
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:15,918
That would have been an
embarrassing way to go.

196
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,571
My gosh. Death by decaf.

197
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,271
Flattened by flat white.

198
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,890
This woman is special.

199
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,711
Help him win her love,
and his attention moves

200
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:26,187
from you right onto her.

201
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,514
- Renée Adler.
- Ah, Miss Adler.

202
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,692
- Sherloque Wells.
- Can I buy you a scone

203
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,103
or something to repay
you for saving my life?

204
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:35,696
Scone? Yes, all night. I mean yes.

205
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:36,772
- Great.
- Thank you very much.

206
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:38,825
Um, uh...

207
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,864
What we shall talk about
while we eat our scones,

208
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,914
- I wonder?
- Oh.

209
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,237
Maybe about, given your
grace and your posture,

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,174
your years of ballet training?

211
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,285
- Since I was four.
- Hmm.

212
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,379
Wow, you're really perceptive.

213
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,974
Well, it's a modest talent, I suppose.

214
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,753
Notice anything else about me?

215
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,552
Challenge accepted.

216
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:01,514
Um, well, East Coast girl?

217
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:02,849
Yes.

218
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:06,445
From a small village,
maybe, um, by a bay?

219
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,897
Work with books? A librarian?

220
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,241
At a university?

221
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:12,825
Live by a train station,
small split-level pad?

222
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,911
You, um, have a dog. Older dog.

223
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,288
Corgi. Anyway, about that scone...

224
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,147
- Okay, stay away from me.
- What?

225
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,493
I don't know how long
you've been watching me,

226
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:21,984
- but it ends now.
- No, no, no.

227
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:24,111
Or I'm calling CCPD, stalker.

228
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:28,041
No, uh, Miss Adler. I...

229
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,751
- Sherlock!
- Sherloque.

230
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,327
Why did you say all that stuff to her?

231
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,180
You know, skip the small talk, no?

232
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,724
- No.
- I have work to do.

233
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:37,892
No, no, no, um, I just... I'm
not really a romance expert,

234
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,336
but I just feel like
you were really into her.

235
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:43,096
Well, yes, maybe a little into her.

236
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,050
Okay, so don't give
up so fast, you know?

237
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,561
Maybe you could, um, try to
find a way to say I'm sorry

238
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:50,939
and I could help you with that.

239
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,431
How could one say no to that?

240
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,601
All right, we're
approaching the position.

241
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,433
Copy.

242
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:59,069
These are the coordinates
of the black market.

243
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,356
Team Snow and Frost are
standing by for backup.

244
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:07,429
Okay. What do we do now?

245
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,032
I guess we say the magic words.

246
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,244
The streets are paved with gold.

247
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,039
Maybe you didn't say it loud enou...

248
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,307
Barry? Ralph?

249
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:27,734
Uh...

250
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,182
Meta cuffs?

251
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,023
That's right, power-dampening cuffs

252
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,026
fitted with an explosive charge

253
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,611
in case you're both metas.

254
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,956
- So tell me, who sent you?
- That's really sweet.

255
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,149
Look how threatening
they're trying to be.

256
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,693
Boys, uh...

257
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,113
We really appreciate all
this, but you can relax.

258
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,507
Big Raf sent us.

259
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,135
Big Raf, huh?

260
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,119
All right, then.

261
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,164
Gentlemen, welcome to the market.

262
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:20,512
So nobody, including us,
knows where we are right now.

263
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,862
And we are totally powerless.

264
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,603
Dude, if we make the wrong move in here,

265
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:27,903
these cuffs are gonna be
the least of our worries.

266
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,768
New game plan.

267
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:33,086
The antihero of our dynamic duo
will find the Field Generator.

268
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:35,923
And you're just gonna stay here
and try not to look like a cop.

269
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,571
- Or a superhero.
- Okay.

270
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,030
Or really anything you actually are.

271
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,708
Just go. I'm fine.

272
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,702
Hey.

273
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,420
You look like a discerning consumer.

274
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,163
Might I interest you
in a little firepower?

275
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,249
- No, I'm good.
- Come to a weapons market

276
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,759
and you don't want any weapons?

277
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,976
I said I'm good. I'm here
for something special.

278
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,523
What's more special than a CCPD killer?

279
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:57,797
What do you mean?

280
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,150
That's what's great about these babies.

281
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,361
Burn through police-issued body armor.

282
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:05,015
I call them toastmasters.
Try it for yourself.

283
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,280
Can't wait to see cops' faces
when these hit the streets.

284
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,557
Or what's left of their faces.

285
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,004
- How much for all of them?
- Uh, all of them?

286
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,256
There's a limit per customer.

287
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,234
I guess I could ask
Goldface for approval.

288
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:43,404
No, why don't we just
work this out between us?

289
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,700
How much will it cost to
take all these off your hands?

290
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,169
Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. Osmack.

291
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,795
Oh, call me Brent. And it's no problem.

292
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:04,258
Any interview about union
reform is time well spent.

293
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,406
What about workers' opinions?

294
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:08,035
I imagine, as a manager, you
must get them all the time.

295
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,285
Yeah, I know most of my
guys better than their wives.

296
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,100
So I guess it must be difficult

297
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:15,510
when one of them surprises you.

298
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:18,272
Like that, um... that killer
that everyone's talking about,

299
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,048
Orlin Dwyer.

300
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,259
Did he ever say anything that
indicated how he was feeling

301
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,779
or what he was up to?

302
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,489
No comment.

303
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,117
Okay, well, did he give
you any kind of clue about

304
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,620
- where he might be now?
- I said no comment.

305
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,312
Did he threaten you?

306
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,147
Look, I know you're scared.

307
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,484
A lot of people were scared
when DeVoe attacked last year.

308
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,337
But the Flash defeated him,

309
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,979
partially because I wrote
these articles that encouraged

310
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:45,925
people to come forward with information.

311
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:48,636
We can stop Dwyer.

312
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,975
Okay, his paychecks went to a P.O. box.

313
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,113
But there was a problem
once, and I had to forward

314
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,753
to his cousin's house.

315
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,862
Uh, his name was, uh, Robbie something.

316
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:05,033
Robbie... Robbie Byrne.

317
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,469
That's great.

318
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:10,399
I'm telling you, man, I
don't have the authority

319
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,984
- to okay a purchase that large.
- Uh, listen...

320
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,310
Excuse me, um, Bartholomew, a word?

321
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,146
Just a word, yeah.

322
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,365
What the hell are you doing?

323
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:22,526
Okay, this guy has got
crates of cop-killing guns.

324
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,154
Would you prefer he
sells them to criminals?

325
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,039
I would prefer that
you not blow our cover,

326
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,077
and you're going to blow our cover.

327
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,826
Come on, man, I asked you to turn off

328
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,833
hero mode for, like, ten minutes.

329
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:32,774
Okay, all right, whatever.

330
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:34,089
Let's not argue about
this here, all right?

331
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,582
Did you find the Field Generator?

332
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:36,684
Of course I did.

333
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:39,186
But you're not gonna like who has it.

334
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,348
What up? What up? And welcome.

335
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,142
I hear something special
in my collection's

336
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,370
- caught your attention.
- You heard right.

337
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,706
- The Neuro-Stasis...
- NeuroStasis Field Generator?

338
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,116
It's a nasty bit of
business, if used properly.

339
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,377
There's nothing proper about
the way we're gonna use it.

340
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,712
My kind of people.

341
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:07,122
Okay. Let's chop it up.

342
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,049
Let's make a deal.

343
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,795
Look, we gonna do a deal or what?

344
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,913
Shut your mouth.

345
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,933
Unless you wanna be one-handed.

346
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,236
Thought not.

347
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:31,054
See, here's the thing.

348
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,983
Scum recognizes scum.

349
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,651
I'm scum.

350
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:40,230
And I've survived this long
by recognizing the same.

351
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,232
Like you. You're scum.

352
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,234
I sniffed you coming a mile away.

353
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,944
Thanks?

354
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,738
But your partner, I don't
sniff nothing on him.

355
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,866
And that worries me.

356
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,763
So the question is...

357
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,849
Who are you?

358
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,333
Well, I can vouch for him. He's just...

359
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,969
I said shut your mouth!

360
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,803
I wanna hear it from him.

361
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:24,675
I'm only gonna ask once more.

362
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:28,279
Who are you?

363
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,684
I'm nobody.

364
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:35,519
No arrests.

365
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,372
No convictions.

366
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:39,398
Not for the Star City Museum heist

367
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,863
where atomized lorazepam
knocked the guards out

368
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,708
or the acid bomb that blew open

369
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,052
the Federal Reserve vault last month.

370
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,457
That was you?

371
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,200
Not according to police reports.

372
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,744
Because the only evidence I
leave behind are red herrings

373
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,704
for idiot cops to chase down.

374
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:56,248
You wanna know who I am?

375
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,893
You can call me the Chemist.

376
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:02,814
But I really don't
care what you call me.

377
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:05,899
Just stop wasting my time.

378
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,561
You should let him do the talking.

379
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:20,832
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Uh, so we back in business?

380
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,085
With a twist.

381
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,130
Got a big job tonight.

382
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,832
Could use a guy like the Chemist

383
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,093
to cover our tracks.

384
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,669
You help me get what I want,

385
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,263
I'll give you what you want.

386
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,081
And what exactly do you want?

387
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,009
Ivo Labs has this
cutting-edge 3-D printer.

388
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,677
Sold it to some hospital.

389
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,587
What's so special about a 3-D printer?

390
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:46,132
This one prints artificial organs.

391
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:50,344
If I've got it, I can sell
life to the highest bidder.

392
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,429
You want us to rob a hospital?

393
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:56,100
Of course not. I'm not a monster.

394
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:58,602
I want you to rob the
lab before it ever gets

395
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:00,163
to the hospital.

396
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,314
Smile, boys.

397
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,701
Tonight you're working for Goldface.

398
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,673
Best birthday present ever, Ralph.

399
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:59,347
- Allô!
- Oh, good, you're here.

400
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,156
So since you let me agree to
help you with your love life...

401
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,102
Right.

402
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:06,247
I came up with an unusual idea.

403
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:07,408
- Spectacular.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,824
I have asked your ex-wives for help.

405
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:10,920
Great. What?

406
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,069
Five women married you for a reason.

407
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:15,843
So who better to ask why
they fell in love with you

408
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,116
- than them?
- Okay, except...

409
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,784
I didn't think any of them would agree,

410
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,744
but four of them actually
jumped at the chance.

411
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:21,837
- Of course they did.
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,414
Because I owe them money.

413
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,457
I'm behind on all the alimony payments,

414
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,882
and they don't know what
Earth I'm on, until now.

415
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:29,143
- What?
- That's right.

416
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:38,929
Hello, Detective.

417
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,023
Hello, chérie.

418
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:45,269
You married the same woman seven times?

419
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:47,459
Well, she's the one for me.

420
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:49,045
Darling, you can't run forever.

421
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,865
We'll always find you.
You're in violation

422
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,211
- of alimony order 1152.
- Time to pay up!

423
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,279
- Ladies.
- We know you had Superman

424
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:57,674
deliver your alimony
to your ex on Earth-38.

425
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:00,686
- What?
- You think we don't all talk?

426
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,252
I was hoping they don't all talk.

427
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,996
- Oh, no, we talk.
- We get together all the time.

428
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,232
- We have to talk.
- Oh, we do.

429
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:06,914
Except I can never get you on the phone.

430
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,759
- I text.
- Mm.

431
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:11,823
Look, I understand. You
want your money, right?

432
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:16,008
So maybe we can... maybe we
can come to an agreement, hmm?

433
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,968
We had an agreement,
one that you're currently

434
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,562
- in breach of.
- Uh...

435
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,221
Uh, ladies.

436
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,815
Ladies, just a big
misunderstanding here.

437
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:24,958
Big misunderstanding.

438
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:26,451
I thought you were all coming here

439
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,186
- to help Sherloque.
- Sherloque.

440
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:29,614
Help him?

441
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,856
You can't help a man who
thinks he knows everything.

442
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,027
Yeah, like the time clues led
him to believe it'd be romantic

443
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,890
to release fruit bats at our wedding.

444
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,073
It's because she support
the endangered species,

445
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:41,402
so I say fruit bat.

446
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,077
I do. I was being thoughtful.

447
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,588
Oh, for our anniversary,
he bought me a puppy dog.

448
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,373
That's... that's not
really... That's kind of nice.

449
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,484
Thank you.

450
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,317
I am deathly allergic to puppy dogs.

451
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,428
The dander makes my throat just...

452
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,839
It's true, but studies
show that more exposure

453
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:57,025
to the allergens, it builds
up your immune system,

454
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:58,300
so I'm trying to give
you a healthy life.

455
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,052
Again, thoughtful on my part.

456
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,513
Well, at least he didn't
deduce that the nicest way

457
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,134
to break up with you was
to fake his own death.

458
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,118
- Ooh.
- Not so thoughtful.

459
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,362
Twice!

460
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,855
Oh, that last one
really was on you, dear.

461
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:14,191
Yeah, seriously.

462
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:16,568
Look, there's gonna be a real death here

463
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,854
if you don't pay us our
money back next month

464
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,697
with interest.

465
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:22,257
We know where you are now.

466
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,480
Plus, we got a great
alimony recovery agent

467
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,037
by the name of Breacher.

468
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,248
Breacher?

469
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,633
Ticktock, Sherlock.

470
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:33,061
Sherloque. Where you're going?

471
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:37,506
- Sherloque.
- Oh, I like how you say it.

472
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:40,258
I don't mean to sound heartless,

473
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:44,221
but, darling, not everyone
is meant for a relationship.

474
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:47,742
Some people are just
destined to be alone.

475
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,401
Sherloque, I...

476
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,630
We roll out in five.

477
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,114
Look, uh, I don't have to ask you

478
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:28,098
how you feel about this.

479
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,861
Stealing from a hospital, that's...

480
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:35,030
That's way more than we bargained for.

481
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:36,940
So if you don't want to do this, I'm...

482
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,359
I'll do it.

483
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,486
You will?

484
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,463
Yeah, what choice do I have?

485
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,788
You warned me to get my head
on straight for this job,

486
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,055
and I didn't.

487
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,136
You had Goldface ready
to give us what we needed,

488
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:51,097
and I blew it trying to get
those guns off the street,

489
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,665
and here we are.

490
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,126
Barry, this is not your fault.

491
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,669
Yeah, it is.

492
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,338
And you were right.

493
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,632
If I wanna stop Cicada,
I can't be so precious

494
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,967
about getting the Flash's hands dirty.

495
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:06,178
Sometimes the ends justify the means.

496
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,680
I get that now.

497
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,349
Let's just get this over with.

498
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:53,868
Who the hell are you?

499
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:00,032
Sorry, um, the door was unlocked.

500
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,192
I'm a reporter. I'm...

501
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:05,505
Uh, I'm looking for
the owner, Robbie Byrne.

502
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,846
I'm Robbie.

503
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,643
So...

504
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:28,796
what kind of story you writing?

505
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,774
It's an investigative report about

506
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:35,944
lead leaking into the water pipes

507
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,654
in this neighborhood.

508
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:41,356
Is that so?

509
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,977
Yeah. Um, yeah.

510
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,451
And it would be, um, very
helpful if you could answer

511
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:50,399
a few questions for me.

512
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,277
All right.

513
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:56,537
But I haven't noticed
anything strange in the water.

514
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,081
That's the scary thing about lead.

515
00:25:58,084 --> 00:25:59,951
I mean, the first sign
would probably be a trip

516
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:01,494
to the hospital.

517
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:04,839
Young children are
especially susceptible.

518
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:07,550
Do you have a daughter?

519
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:13,965
I used to.

520
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,971
I'm sorry to hear that.

521
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:21,990
And what about you?

522
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,900
Me?

523
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:25,902
I'm feeling better than ever.

524
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,979
Well, lead poisoning can present itself

525
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:30,898
- in a variety of ways.
- Look, it's late.

526
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,192
And I've got to get to bed soon, so...

527
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,194
Of course, Mr. Byrne. I understand.

528
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:38,030
Um, I still have a few more questions.

529
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,908
I mean, I could always come
to your office tomorrow,

530
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,086
if you like.

531
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,556
Would you prefer I
see you tomorrow, then?

532
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,768
No.

533
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:54,380
Let's finish this now.

534
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:02,722
Making tea?

535
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,016
No, making an espresso because the mind

536
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:06,535
needs more caffeine.

537
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,853
Um, that's just hot water.

538
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:12,040
No, no, it...

539
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,691
Nom de Dieu.

540
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,126
Sherloque, you know that
stuff your ex-wife said

541
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:19,881
isn't true, right?

542
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:23,075
No, I'm destined to be alone.

543
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,537
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

544
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:28,098
Listen.

545
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,584
You treat love like it's a
mystery that can be solved.

546
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:35,313
But you can't deduce your
way to a happy ending.

547
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:41,236
You just have to let it
come one step at a time

548
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,572
and enjoy whatever step you're in.

549
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,431
Okay, listen up.

550
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:10,756
Get in, get out.

551
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,933
Our guy on the inside
said the place is empty,

552
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:15,604
and you all have the
code and the pass cards.

553
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,756
Switch your weapons from
stun to meet your maker.

554
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,276
Let's go.

555
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:25,447
Go.

556
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,611
Barry, let me check your rifle.

557
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:42,514
- I think it needs a new clip.
- What?

558
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,115
Left my phone in there.
Can you check for me?

559
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,742
We gotta...

560
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:48,211
- Clear.
- Move, move, move.

561
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:49,954
Ralph, there's no phone, man. There's...

562
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:53,216
What are you doing? Hey, hey!

563
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:54,809
What are you... Ralph!

564
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,353
You're right, Barry.

565
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:58,462
- Flash doesn't have to do this.
- What?

566
00:28:58,464 --> 00:28:59,744
But I can.

567
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,225
Ralph.

568
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,509
Hey, hey!

569
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:05,228
Ralph, let me out!

570
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,472
I can back you up, man!

571
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:10,141
Don't go alone!

572
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,068
Ralph!

573
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,769
Ralph.

574
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,589
I can have your back,
man! Don't go alone!

575
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,357
Where's the Chemist?

576
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,685
He said something about us
leaving an orgy of evidence

577
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,521
in the truck. He's handling it.

578
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:58,807
All right, fan out and search.

579
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,385
Signal back when you find it.

580
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,505
Hey, anonymous criminal colleague,

581
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,341
this is it.

582
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:38,038
Kind of overkill with the packaging.

583
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,763
Yo, this ain't a library, man.

584
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:48,715
You wanna give me a hand?

585
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:51,051
Yeah, how about two?

586
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,805
Sorry, not sorry, pal.

587
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,058
This baby's going to a hospital.

588
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,111
Honestly, I never liked you.

589
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:04,615
Take this trash out to
the truck for disposal.

590
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,033
And his friend too.

591
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:07,951
Come on, come on.

592
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:11,663
All right, let's pack it up.

593
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:12,882
Chop-chop.

594
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:37,406
Brick!

595
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:38,598
Ralph!

596
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,867
Oh!

597
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,396
Well, thank you, but for the record,

598
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:45,897
I meant throw the brick to me.

599
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,459
I was trying to throw it to you.

600
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,903
I see you couldn't
go through with it either.

601
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,665
Not after I saw those little kids.

602
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,241
Carver's in there with the printer.

603
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:58,469
There's a lot of guns.
We don't have any powers.

604
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,365
But these do have a stun setting.

605
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,433
Come on.

606
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:13,800
All in a day's work, people.

607
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:16,177
- Cover me!
- Break, break, break!

608
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:18,805
- Go! Watch it!
- Go, go, go, go!

609
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:25,312
- Where'd that come from?
- I tripped.

610
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,456
Let's get that printer.

611
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,018
Barry!

612
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:58,678
Don't move!

613
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:38,193
I knew all that "Red
Dead" would pay off.

614
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,367
Good help's so hard to find.

615
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:48,513
Both of you, loading dock. Now.

616
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:49,872
Go.

617
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:00,123
Good boys.

618
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,575
I was hoping you wouldn't
make Daddy use his belt.

619
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,205
Since you obeyed me,

620
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:10,542
I'm not gonna blow your arms off.

621
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,210
I'm gonna kill you

622
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:15,922
in a more traditional way.

623
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:17,424
And I prom...

624
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:28,077
He really should have frisked us first.

625
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:40,071
See, that's the thing... My gold...

626
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:47,245
It don't just make me look pretty.

627
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,828
All right, Goldie Hawn. Let's do this.

628
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:34,792
Since I'm going into
the organ donor business,

629
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:37,240
you'll be happy to know
that your corpse is going

630
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:40,038
to a good cause:

631
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,315
making me rich.

632
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:50,850
Hey! Why you so mad at him?

633
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:54,070
He's not the one that made
you fall for a fake backstory.

634
00:35:57,025 --> 00:36:00,076
Goldface, huh? More like Fool's Gold.

635
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:20,213
Good thing he didn't
know this wasn't loaded.

636
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:30,607
He's alive.

637
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:32,892
Yeah, and so are we.

638
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,703
Thanks to you.

639
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,229
The Chemist?

640
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,467
Well, I, um... I should get going.

641
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,363
Thank you so much. I
really appreciate it.

642
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:56,082
You didn't have that bag
when you came in here.

643
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:43,272
We're gonna beat you.

644
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:52,682
Well, you got pretty banged up,

645
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:55,167
but your powers are
already working their magic.

646
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:56,835
No signs of permanent damage.

647
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,987
Guess the only real loss
today was our mission.

648
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,458
Yeah.

649
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:03,383
No, we'll find another way
to get the Field Generator.

650
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:06,521
And besides, we did
have another win today.

651
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:10,107
We took down a powerful
meta-human without our powers.

652
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:12,309
That's a good reminder that
even when Cicada dampens us,

653
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:15,455
we have other ways to fight.

654
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:19,858
Hello?

655
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,402
Iris?

656
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,659
Dwyer's gone.

657
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:30,120
I'll get Iris.

658
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,647
- I got nothing in here.
- Ditto upstairs.

659
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,710
Yeah, there's no evidence here

660
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:38,750
that points to where he went.

661
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:41,004
Did you find that device you needed?

662
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:45,926
Maybe we don't need it.

663
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,560
I know how to give the cure to Cicada.

664
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:57,989
I know his weakness.

665
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,713
Uh, pardon.

666
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,280
- May I offer you a refill?
- Oh, God.

667
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:05,428
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

668
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,900
I need to tell you
something. Don't be alarmed.

669
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,743
I am not a stalker. I'm a detective.

670
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:14,097
This is how I knew all
these facts about you.

671
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,457
I deduced them.

672
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:20,636
It's immodest to say, but I
happen to be quite good at it.

673
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:23,523
- Prove it.
- Pardon?

674
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:26,517
Show me. Do, um...

675
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:29,720
Do that guy.

676
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:35,785
- Challenge accepted.
- Great.

677
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:40,272
So if you look at the size of his drink,

678
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:42,625
small relative to his body mass.

679
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:45,986
And the hesitation but also
the enjoyment with which

680
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:48,619
he consumes his
beverage, it's elementary.

681
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:51,492
This is a man who has a dairy allergy

682
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:54,712
but still prefers to drink milk lattes,

683
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:56,121
but not without consequence.

684
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:58,666
Oh, wait for it. And...

685
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,412
- Oh.
- Et voilà.

686
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:05,815
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mm.

687
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:09,009
- You are really good at this.
- What can I say?

688
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:12,304
It is a modest talent.
But I must apologize for...

689
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:14,807
How do they say... Creeping you out.

690
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:19,162
But if perhaps you would
allow yourself to forgive me,

691
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:22,915
then I could buy you a
tea to make it up to you.

692
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,984
Well, I have to go to work now.

693
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:27,703
- Ah, all right, no.
- But... but I...

694
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:31,017
- Yes, of course.
- You can call me sometime.

695
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,175
Really?

696
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:33,534
Well...

697
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:37,388
- Ah, merci.
- Mm.

698
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,597
I look forward to, um, sometime.

699
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,641
Me too.

700
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:42,518
- Mm. So...
- Thanks.

701
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,853
Whoa, oh!

702
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,081
- Oh, you all right?
- Oh, gosh.

703
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,671
I guess I should have started ballet

704
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:47,840
when I was three, right?

705
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:49,266
- Of course, yes.
- Whoo!

706
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:53,104
- Okay, bye.
- Au revoir, Miss Adler.

707
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,057
Ah, you're amazing.

708
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,210
You're a meta.

709
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:13,124
Computer on.

710
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:17,369
Close Nora West-Allen file.

711
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,130
Open Cicada casework.

712
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,558
All right.

713
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:26,804
He will not harm you.

714
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:41,933
If your mission is successful,

715
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:45,563
your secret is safe.

716
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:48,392
And you and I are free to
continue what we started.
