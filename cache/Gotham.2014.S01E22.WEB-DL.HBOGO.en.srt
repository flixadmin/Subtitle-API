1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,960
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
You haven't by chance seen
Officer Dougherty?

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,680
We're supposed
to have dinner last night,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,560
he didn't show, no surprise.
But I haven't seen him today.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,920
Me neither.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
Barbara, we're doing this
for you.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
- He's dead.
- Yeah, he's dead.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,720
It's gonna be okay.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,120
Bruce, your father
was a true stoic.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
He kept his best self-hidden.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
Your father was a good man.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,560
But even good man have secrets.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,480
You have a hard head, James,
just like your father.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
Gotham is on the knife edge.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,640
But I won't let it fall apart
without a fight.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,240
Just got wind of three
separate attacks

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
on Falcone businesses
in different parts of town.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,760
It's Maroni.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,160
We're in a shooting war.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
Good morning, child.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,320
We ain't children.
And it ain't morning.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Oh, it will be soon.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,760
A brand new day.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Still looking for secrets,
are we, Sir?

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,240
Or just breaking stuff?

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Secrets.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I don't know.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,360
The whole city
is going doolally around us.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,520
I mean, there's civil bloody war
on the streets.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
And you were there
worrying about your poor old dad.

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,480
Yes, I am.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
If your father had a secret life,

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
which I hate to say to you
that he didn't,

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
I'd know about it, wouldn't I?

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,200
A sober, diligent man he was.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Never out gallivanting.
Home every night like clockwork,

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,600
working in this very room.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, I remember.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
I wasn't allowed to disturb him
while he was working.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
- Nobody was.
- Classical music.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,560
- He would play for hours.
- That's right.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,440
Mum and I would read books
or play board games

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,600
until he was done.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,960
I remember...

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,560
I've tried to sneak in
to see him.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
But the door was locked.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
Was the door always locked,
Alfred?

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah, well, I suppose so,
when he was working.

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,480
Why though?

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,640
Why lock the door?

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,080
That's what doors are for,
isn't it?

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
It's in here. It's in this room.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
My father's secret,
it's in this room!

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
I know it. I know it!

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
Hello, young lady.
I like your style.

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,400
{\an5}Move Falcone's guy on one cell
and Maroni's on another.

57
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,240
{\an5}Officer Katz, right?

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,960
{\an5}Yes, Sir, Katz, Griffin.

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,600
{\an5}Word of advice, Katz.

60
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,960
{\an5}I'm a dead duck around here.

61
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,280
{\an5}The brass are gonna fire me

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,000
{\an5}just as soon
as this gang war cools off.

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
So, don't salute me.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
{\an5}Makes you look like a robot.

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
{\an5}- Hi.
- Detective.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,040
{\an5}- Dr. Thompkins.
- Jim.

67
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
Thanks for coming to see me.

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
{\an5}It's good to see you
looking so well.

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
I am well.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,360
{\an5}Much better.

71
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,160
{\an5}Yes, you are.
This is your last check-up.

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,400
{\an5}You are all healed physically.

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,840
{\an5}But you need to get
some trauma counseling.

74
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,280
{\an5}Doc, I'm happy.
I am happy to be alive.

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,720
{\an5}Which is why...

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
{\an5}Jim, I didn't wanna leave
without saying

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,760
{\an5}thank you properly.

78
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,360
Thank you, for saving my life.

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I was glad to do it.

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,400
Ms. Kean, trauma counseling.
Like yesterday.

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,840
I have several recommendations
for you.

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,600
- Really, Doc, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

83
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,680
After what you've been through,
nobody would be fine.

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,520
Fine.

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,880
If you will be my counselor.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,280
And we do it at my place.

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,440
No, I have some trauma training,
but it's not my area focus.

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,720
I like you.

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,880
I mean, I can talk to you. Please?

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,160
Okay.

91
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Deal.

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
{\an5}Hey, Jim, did you hear the news?
Don Falcone just got hit.

93
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
{\an5}- Jim.
- What?

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
{\an5}Falcone got hit 20 minutes ago.
Maroni's boys blew up his car.

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,920
{\an5}- What do you mean, he's dead?
- No, he's at the hospital.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
{\an5}But he will be dead soon enough.

97
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,600
{\an5}Listen, Essen said City Hall
and the big wigs okayed the hit.

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
{\an5}They switched their support
to Maroni.

99
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,640
{\an5}Maroni? That hooligan?
He think he can run the city?

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Someone had to go.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
This war has been bad
for business.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,640
{\an5}Hello? Hello?

103
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,040
Good morning, good morning.

104
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,320
Oh, Penguin, thank God,
get me out of here.

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
Maroni's men will be here
any minute.

106
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,200
Yes, I imagine so.

107
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,480
Mustn't stay long.

108
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,320
I knew I'd regret it if I didn't
say goodbye to you in person.

109
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
It was me, old friend.

110
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
I did this to you.

111
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
I started the war.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,160
From the day I met you,
I was planning your end.

113
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm sorry it has to be in this...

114
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,760
Squalid little corner.

115
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
C'est la vie.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
Why?

117
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Nothing personal, I assure you, Sir.

118
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,440
You have been a wise mentor
and a good friend.

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
But...

120
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,120
Business must come first.

121
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm gonna take your place, old man.

122
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm gonna be the King of Gotham.

123
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
You?

124
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Never.

125
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,120
You're going to burn in hell.

126
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
I do worry about that.

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,160
But you first, old friend.

128
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
You first.

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,360
Nobody move.

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
- Walk away.
- Shut up.

131
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,920
You're both under arrest
for attempted murder.

132
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,800
Didn't you hear?

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Falcone is out, by official decree.

134
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
Everyone agreed.

135
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,280
I heard.

136
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
So, release me, Jim.

137
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Get on the winning side.

138
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Winning side, my ass.

139
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
Maroni is a fool.
He can't replace me.

140
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,680
A thousand rivals will jump up
to challenge him.

141
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,280
There will be civil war.

142
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,960
- If I die now, Gotham falls apart.
- I agree.

143
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
But can you turn things around?
Can you take back control?

144
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Of course.

145
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,520
Two days at my safe house.

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
I need two days to make some moves,

147
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
and I'll skin Maroni
and those disloyal scum.

148
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Like rabbits.

149
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
Wake up, Napoleon.

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
Maroni's louts are minutes away
from coming here

151
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
to cut your throat.

152
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,320
And the thing is, Jim,

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,520
they aren't very fond of me either.

154
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
So, seriously,

155
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,640
you need to uncuff me. Jim?

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
Jim, where the hell
did you run off to?

157
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
Harv, I'm in the hospital
with Falcone.

158
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
There's nobody here.

159
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,360
No kidding, what the hell
are you doing there?

160
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
You got to get out now,

161
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,040
they'll be coming back
to finish him off.

162
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah, any moment now.

163
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,520
Unless I get him out of here.

164
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,680
- Jim, Jim, Jim.
- I could use some help.

165
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
No way, are you nuts?

166
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,120
He's a bad man, but he's
the best bad man we've got.

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
If Falcone loses control,

168
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,240
Maroni is too wild to run Gotham.

169
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,640
There'll be anarchy.

170
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,080
Yeah, probably.
But Falcone already lost control.

171
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
And he'll get it back.

172
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,440
Listen, you're all twisted
over what happened to Barbara.

173
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
You're not thinking straight.

174
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,960
Yeah, maybe.

175
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
But I'm done on this town anyhow.
What do I have to lose?

176
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Your life.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
How about your life?

178
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,720
What the hell are you doing here?

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,920
I thought the fix was in
with you guys.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,680
- Can you walk?
- If I have to.

181
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,840
Let's get you out of here.
I'll take you to your safe house.

182
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560
Jim, my friend.

183
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,760
You are making a terrible mistake.

184
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,280
I'm doing this for the city not you.

185
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,560
You're the least worst option.

186
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,560
If I didn't think
you could take back control,

187
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,600
I'd let you die.

188
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Just so we're clear.

189
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,840
We're clear.

190
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,080
Well, you can't leave me here!
Maroni's men will kill me!

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Possible.

192
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,680
No, you arrested us,
we are in your custody.

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That's true.

194
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,200
You owe me a favor, Jim! You owe me!

195
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,560
Dammit.

196
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,160
James Gordon!

197
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,840
Detective Gordon!

198
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
Don't kill him.

199
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
Good morning, fellas.

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,600
What can I help you with?

201
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,600
James Gordon, as usual,
wrong place, wrong time.

202
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
Go. Now.

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why?

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,280
So, these men
can kill Carmine Falcone?

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,080
I have no knowledge of that.

206
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,360
Go. That's an order.

207
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,680
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

208
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
I hope to see you
behind bars very soon.

209
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,200
Or dead. Whichever.

210
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Hope...

211
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
It's for losers, Jim.

212
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,680
He is all yours!

213
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,800
Jim, Jim, don't shoot, it's me.

214
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
We got to go, their ambulance

215
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,880
is in the basement.
Where is your man?

216
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,080
About that...

217
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,680
We got to take Penguin
and Gilzean too.

218
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
Penguin and Gilzean?

219
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
I arrested them for attempted murder,

220
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,960
- they're in my custody.
- I didn't even

221
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
wanna argue with you,
Come on, let's go! Go!

222
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,760
Tommy? Tommy?

223
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Dammit.

224
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,400
What exactly are you looking for,
Master Bruce?

225
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,520
Will I find it or not?

226
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
Nobody knows
about this place, right?

227
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

228
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
Anyone who did is dead.

229
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
We'll be safe here.

230
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
Hello.

231
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
What's up?

232
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
I know, I know.

233
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,720
It's astonishing.
Sometimes I astonish myself.

234
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,960
I feel like this is all a dream.

235
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,400
And I'm gonna wake up soon.

236
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,680
Barbara, you were abducted.

237
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
Your parents were killed
in front of you.

238
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,280
Yeah, yeah, that's real.

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm talking about this now, this...

240
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
This is the dream.

241
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm gonna wake up.

242
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,040
And he's still alive.

243
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,240
And he's coming for me.

244
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,920
I thought for sure you were dead.
Let me look at you.

245
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Fish?

246
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
It's really you.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,960
It's me, Butch, I'm home.

248
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,040
My poor baby.
What did they do to you?

249
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
Nothing good.

250
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
It's him, boss.

251
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,720
Don Maroni.

252
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Yes, alive and well.

253
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,920
That's a long story.

254
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
We need to talk.

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,760
I have something you want.

256
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,040
They didn't find my knife.

257
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,160
So, we're saved then.

258
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,680
It's in my sock.

259
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
If you get the chance,

260
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,760
- take some of them with us.
- I'll try.

261
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Hey, you.

262
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
Selina, what are you doing here?

263
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,320
Chilling. How about you?

264
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,840
Kind a jammed up.

265
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,280
Yeah. That's too bad.

266
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,600
That's mime for help us out her.

267
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,920
And totally blow
the coolest gig ever.

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,560
Just because
we kinda sorta known each other.

269
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Right?

270
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Hello, fellas.

271
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Carmine?

272
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Penguin?

273
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,960
Nothing to share?

274
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, I have a little something.

275
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,440
I just made a sweet deal with Maroni.

276
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,800
He just told me I could have
all my territories back.

277
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,320
And all I have to do in return...

278
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,120
Is give him Carmine's head.

279
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
Fish, I need to go lie down.

280
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,240
What did you do
to that poor soul, you sadists?

281
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,240
I assure you...

282
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
You'll die...

283
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,040
A slow and painful death
on account of Butch.

284
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,520
You too, Carmine.

285
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
And you.

286
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
We'll keep it simple.

287
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
And you...

288
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
We're cool.

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,560
Any questions?

290
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,200
How you gonna kill them?

291
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,600
I love this girl.

292
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,240
Jason saw right through me.

293
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
He knew me instantly.

294
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Like I was naked.

295
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
It's scary.

296
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
But thrilling.

297
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,560
And aren't...

298
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,680
all the best guys a little scary?

299
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,880
I was way more scared of Jim Gordon

300
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,440
the first date we went on.

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,280
So, butch and stern.

302
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,320
That type, they often have
a bad temper.

303
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,960
But Jim was a sweetie.

304
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,320
He never laid a finger on me.

305
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
It's kind of surprising.

306
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Does he ever hit you?

307
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,480
Me? No. Why?

308
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,320
Why would he hit anyone? Any woman?

309
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
You know,

310
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,160
out of passion.

311
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,320
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

312
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Only I heard you and Jim were dating.

313
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
No.

314
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,640
Yes, we've been on a few dates.

315
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm sorry,
I didn't think that you knew.

316
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,320
If that makes you uncomfortable
in any way.

317
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,640
No, don't be silly.

318
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,480
I, I'm happy for you.

319
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
He's one of the good guys.

320
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,960
Yeah, he is.

321
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Hey, are you hungry?

322
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,400
So, there he is.

323
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
Fish,

324
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,960
you mysterious,
crazy, gorgeous, killer you.

325
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I love you.

326
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
This...

327
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,160
This is delicious.

328
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,920
Finally.

329
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,280
You're hard to kill, old man.

330
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
No.

331
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
Your people are second-rate.

332
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,800
Ms. Mooney, if I may, brief word.

333
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,360
I know my life is forfeit.

334
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,200
I speak not for my sake, but yours.

335
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,200
Because after all,
I still love and respect you.

336
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,200
Kill me if you must,
but keep Falcone alive.

337
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
As soon as he's dead,
Maroni has no use for you.

338
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
You are simply a threat.
He will kill you.

339
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
You think?

340
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,120
Why would he need
another boss in town?

341
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
Another rival?

342
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,960
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

343
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,240
A, she's not a rival,
because she's not a boss.

344
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,600
She's an underboss.

345
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,440
And underboss takes orders.
I don't take orders.

346
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,640
I know that. We're cool. Relax.

347
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm relaxed.

348
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
I don't think you are, babes.

349
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,520
Please don't call me babes.

350
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,400
You See? Not relaxed.

351
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,840
Babes?

352
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,600
Really? It's a term of endearment.

353
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,960
Means I like you.

354
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,800
Fine, I misspoke.

355
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,800
You're not an underboss
and you're not a babe.

356
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
You tell me what you are.

357
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
What we are, Sal...

358
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
Are partners.

359
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Whatever you want.

360
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,600
Partners.

361
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,840
I'm partner number one
and you're partner number two.

362
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
That's the deal, right?

363
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm number one, and you are?

364
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Number two.

365
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,920
There you go.
Simple math, one, two, babes.

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Sorry.

367
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,920
That's the last time, I swear.

368
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,480
Guys, can you feel
the buzz in the air?

369
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,120
As victory.

370
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
Redemption.

371
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Power.

372
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,600
When this old man dies,
a new day begins.

373
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,080
We will rule Gotham.

374
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,120
We are building a dynasty.

375
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,200
We will whip this town
like a rented mule.

376
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Right, babes?

377
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh, relax. I'm kidding you.

378
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
Guys, don't, seriously...

379
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,800
Don't call her babes or toots
or what have you.

380
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
It's a women's lib thing.

381
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
I am relaxed.

382
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
Let's go!

383
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
Barbara, we've been circling
around the subject,

384
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,040
but haven't talked about
what actually happened to you.

385
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,400
What was done to you.

386
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,920
Lee, you're a nice lady.

387
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
I could go there.

388
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,800
But I'm not sure
you wanna go there with me.

389
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,920
Don't worry about me.

390
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,520
Has Jim told you he loves you?

391
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,880
- Barbara...
- Fair's fair.

392
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,160
And I'm telling you
all my little secrets.

393
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,920
No, he hasn't.

394
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,960
But he will though, won't he?

395
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,000
You can feel it coming.

396
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,760
I mean, come on, look at you,
you're so gorgeous and smart,

397
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,000
of course, he loves you.

398
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
Do you love him?

399
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Barbara...

400
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,800
Tell me what happened.

401
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
If we can get to 7th Avenue

402
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,160
without being spotted by
Fish's people, we're home free.

403
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,560
Then what?

404
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
We find a safe place, regroup.

405
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,440
Maroni's death
is a lucky break for you.

406
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,560
- Spoken like a true Mafioso.
- Yeah.

407
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,480
The least worst option,
like you said.

408
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,920
Without you, the city falls apart.

409
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,680
Yes, I said that.
And it might be true.

410
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,880
But this has been a long day.

411
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,200
And I've had a long time to
look at this world I've created.

412
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,640
I'm done with this business. I'm out.

413
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,000
I've got a place down south
I could go to.

414
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,200
- You're sorry?
- I know.

416
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm letting you down.

417
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,640
I'm letting the city down, I know.

418
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,120
Okay. Plan B.

419
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,120
So, you got a place down south.

420
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,520
Nice? On the water?

421
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
Yes.

422
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
Any work for beat-up old cops?

423
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
Sure.

424
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
How's that sound, Jim?

425
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,600
Beaches, sunshine, fishing.

426
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Yeah, tempting.

427
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Hello again.

428
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,120
Cat got your tongue?

429
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Selina.

430
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Boys.

431
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Bless you.

432
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm gonna hand it to you, Fish.

433
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,240
You really know how to stop a show.

434
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,840
I couldn't help myself, Harvey.
The man vexed me.

435
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,680
Crazy move,
possibly a good move too.

436
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,840
We'll see.
The battlefield is in flux.

437
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,800
You could be looking at
the new Queen of Gotham.

438
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,360
Congratulations, my dear.

439
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,560
I'm quitting, Fish. I'm out.

440
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,000
Does this mean,
I don't have to kill you?

441
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,680
You're gonna retire some place warm?

442
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,040
Lay back,
read your little funny papers?

443
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,560
That was the thought.

444
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
Yeah, a nice thought.

445
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Please no.

446
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,640
Fish! Where are you?

447
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Then he left me...

448
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
For a long time.

449
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Alone.

450
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
And I slept...

451
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't know for how long.

452
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,600
And then he woke me up.

453
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,920
Road trip, he said.

454
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
We were halfway there when...

455
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
I realized...

456
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,880
We're going to my parent's house.

457
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Go on.

458
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
Well, then, he tied them up to chair.

459
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,520
And...

460
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,600
He told me to talk to them
about my childhood issues.

461
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,880
So, I did.

462
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,400
I just told them
whatever came into my head.

463
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
And what came into your head?

464
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,280
You know...

465
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Just stupid kid stuff,
I guess, like...

466
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,600
My mum used to call me her
little piggy when I was little.

467
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
They threw away my posters.

468
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Never nurtured my self-esteem.

469
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,120
Just slowly...

470
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Steadily...

471
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,240
Grinding away at my soul.

472
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Trying to make me disappear.

473
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,080
That's not kid stuff.

474
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
To be fair to them...

475
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,040
They simply never understood me.

476
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
They have no clue...

477
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Who I am.

478
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,760
Even when I was killing them,
they just gaped at me like fools.

479
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,040
No understanding.

480
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Barbara...

481
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,640
Jason Lennon killed your parents.
You didn't kill them.

482
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Yes, I did.

483
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,480
I stabbed them several times.

484
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,160
And then I slit their throats.

485
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
I have to leave now, please.

486
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Are you uncomfortable?

487
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,720
How about now?

488
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Lee?

489
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,160
She just... She just went crazy.

490
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
I told them that woman was trouble.

491
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,000
Butch, about time.

492
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,960
- Shoot her, Butch.
- Really?

493
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,400
Do as I say, Butch. Shoot her!

494
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,560
What are you doing? Drop him!

495
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,920
My friend, remember your training.

496
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,840
I order you to shoot her.

497
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,320
Butch, don't listen to him.
He did something to your mind.

498
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,280
I'm your girl.
Remember, I'm your girl.

499
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,680
Kill her now!

500
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,640
Oh, my God. What did I do?

501
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,200
I'm so sorry.

502
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm so sorry, I would never hurt you.

503
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,760
I love you, Fish.

504
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,880
It's okay.

505
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,000
It's not your fault. I love you too.

506
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,600
He messed with your mind.
It's not your fault.

507
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
And you're gonna be fine.

508
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
You know me.

509
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Goodbye, Fish.

510
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,800
It's all good.

511
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,760
No!

512
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,440
I'm the King of Gotham.

513
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,480
I'm the King of Gotham!

514
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm the King of Gotham!

515
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Mr. Nygma.

516
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Ms. Kringle.

517
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,320
I just noticed
something really weird.

518
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,520
This note Officer
Dougherty left for me...

519
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,000
The first letter of every lines
spells out your name.

520
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
You see?

521
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,040
N.Y.G.M.A.

522
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,080
Yes.

523
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,240
How odd.

524
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,600
What an amazing coincidence.

525
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Coincidence?

526
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,880
What else could it be?

527
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,480
So, you know nothing about this?

528
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
I... Me? No, no.

529
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
No.

530
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,160
Why are you laughing, you fool?
It's not funny.

531
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,920
She'll keep digging.

532
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,520
Why did you have to leave a clue?
Why?

533
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,440
Relax.

534
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,160
What can she find?
What can she prove?

535
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Nothing. There's no body.
Stop worrying.

536
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
But she looked so sad and angry.

537
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,840
I hate it when she looks at me
that way.

538
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,120
Like it matters,
like you stand a chance with her.

539
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,680
She knows how you feel about her
and she treats you like dirt.

540
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,960
I don't care, I still love her.

541
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Listen to yourself. Be a man!

542
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
You'll do better way with that one

543
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,240
if she's a little scared of you.
Stop talking.

544
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,040
Hey! Just keeping it real.

545
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,360
What's black and white
and red all over?

546
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
Stop it!

547
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,240
This is so weird.

548
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,840
Beautiful.

549
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,040
I'm gonna miss this town.

550
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,880
You won't change your mind?

551
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,120
The town needs you.

552
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,320
No.

553
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,360
Gotham needs a lawman now.
Not a criminal like me.

554
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,880
A strong lawman.

555
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,000
You're looking at me?

556
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,680
Someone needs to grab this city
by the neck and shake it hard.

557
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
That's you, Jim.

558
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,520
I know it in my bones.

559
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
There's a lot of powerful men who
would disagree with you on that.

560
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Nice knife.

561
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,120
That was your father's.
He gave it to me a long time ago.

562
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,760
A spur of the moment birthday gift.

563
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,880
I said, "No."

564
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Such a beautiful knife

565
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,680
and I have men with guns
to protect me.

566
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,160
He said, "Take it."

567
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,600
"A knife is a good friend
when you have no other."

568
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,000
You were that close.

569
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
At one time.

570
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,280
The point of the story, Jim...

571
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,880
Your father was
the most honest man I ever met.

572
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,560
But he carried a knife.

573
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Enough searching.
There's nothing here.

574
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,560
Your father was a good man,
a flawed man, like anyone else,

575
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,320
but it doesn't mean he had
a secret life.

576
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,440
My intuitions
are nearly always correct.

577
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,480
Well...

578
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,000
It's a common delusion I find.

579
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Arkham is full of men whose
intuitions are always correct.

580
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,160
There are none so blind.

581
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,640
None so blind.

582
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,560
Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius!

583
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What about him?

584
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
He was a Roman emperor.

585
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,720
Yes, I'm fully aware of that,
Master Bruce.

586
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,960
And a stoic.

587
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,240
I think I remember
he was a stoic like my father.

588
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,240
Lucius Fox called my father
a stoic.

589
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,680
Lots of people are called stoic.

590
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,160
Does not mean
a hard nut doesn't say much.

591
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,760
Doesn't mean
it's a bloody clue, does it?

592
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,160
It's a philosophy, Alfred.
It's a way of life.

593
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,920
Maybe that as well, I supposed but...

594
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,160
What is it, do you think?

595
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I don't know and I don't care.

596
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,760
And don't you dare
press that bloody button.

597
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,160
- Why not?
- It could be a bomb.

598
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
Alfred, that seems improbable.

599
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,920
It's a stereo.
