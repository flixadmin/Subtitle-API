I'll take the pink one.

It's a pink one.

28
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,870
- Oh, Skyler.

29
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,870
- I know, right?

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,510

Hey, buddy.

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,830
Ready for a cold one?

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,480
No, no.

37
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,070
Not feeling 100 percent.

38
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,070
Oh, I hope it's not something you ate.

39
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,950
No, no. I just--

We have Pepto,

Uncle Hank.

42
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,910
Yeah.

43
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,910
Uh, no, I'm good, I, uh--

44
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,910
I think we need to shove off.

45
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,230
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,230
Oh. Okay.

No, no. Don't worry

49
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,310
about it. I have help.

50
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,350
And by that, she means me.

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,350
Ha, ha.

52
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,080
- That is correct.

- Holly can help.

54
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,550
- Let's go send them on their way.

55
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,550
- Yeah.

56
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,550
Let's say goodbye

57
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,550
to auntie and uncle.

58
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,830
Been too long.

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,430
Say, "Bye, auntie."

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,430
Bye, sweetie, bye-bye.

61
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,710
You know, it's been about 100 years

62
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,710
since we've been bowling.

63
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,550
- Then how about Thursday?

64
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,550
- Oh, that sounds great.

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,390
Thank you for having us.

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,430
Absolutely. Take care of him.

67
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,430
Hey. You okay to drive?

68
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

69
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,070
All right, well, feel better.

70
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,150
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank.

71
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,150
Bye-bye."

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,020
"Bye, Uncle Hank.

73
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,020
Bye, Aunt Marie."

74
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,070
All right, let's get started on

75
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,070
those dishes. Come on.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,270
You.

77
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,270
You.

78
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,790
No, you.

79
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,790
You.

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,470
Washing, okay?

81
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,470
I'll dry. You wash.

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,310
You're a good washer.

83
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,310
Hello, Carol.

84
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,940
Oh, hi, Walt.

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Europe.

86
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
I can't believe it.

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
Were you there

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
when she said that?

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,070
Yeah.

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,230
You okay? Your stomach okay?

91
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

92
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,070
God, Jesus, Europe.

94
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,840
I just--

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,150
And, you know, where they were

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,150
three or four months ago.

97
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,630
She was talking about it

98
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,630
like it was a second honeymoon.

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,510
We need to go to Europe. We could go.

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,510
Yeah.

101
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,140
Have it be like a business trip,

102
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,140
you know?

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,550
It could, um, be Italy.

104
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,550
To Lake Como...

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,500
Hank? Hank?

106
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,270
Hank? You okay?

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,750
Hank!

108
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,790
Oh, my God. Hank?

109
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,990
Hank? Hank?

110
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,350
Oh, my God. Hank?

111
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,430
No. Are you okay?

112
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,430
I'm good.

113
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,670
Call an ambulance!

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,670
Call an ambulance!

115
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,500
Okay. You okay?

116
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Just take a breath.

117
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Yeah.

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,070
Oh, God, sweetie.

119
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,740
- An accident. It happens.

120
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,740
- I'll make the appointment.

121
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,270
All you have to do is show up.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,270
For what?

123
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,550
Three hours in the emergency room,

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,550
all for nothing.

125
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,670
All they did was rule out

126
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,670
a heart attack.

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,110
What if it happens again?

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,110
It won't happen again.

129
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,590
How can you know that?

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,590
You can't say what it was.

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,780
Marie, baby.

132
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,780
I'm okay. I'm fine, trust me.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,780
Discussion over.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,910
And do not tell Skyler.

135
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,910
What? Why?

136
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,590
Just don't.

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,750
There's nothing to be

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,750
embarrassed about. Hank?

139
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,790
Luis.

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,220
Enrique. Ooh.

141
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,110
Hi.

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,020
Hi.

143
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,470
Okay.

144
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,190
Here you go. There's complimentary

145
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,190
coffee inside. Have an A-1 day.

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,670
Air fresheners are high-margin, right?

147
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,390
At 30 cents wholesale?

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,390
Yeah.

149
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,550
Right. So I'm thinking

150
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,550
we reorganize the display.

151
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,910
Separate the food scents

152
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,910
from the nature scents.

153
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,590
I mean, does bubble gum

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,590
belong anywhere near

155
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,590
ocean spray? No.

156
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,470
And pine is still

157
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,470
our biggest seller, right?

158
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,830
So maybe we move that

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,830
over to the cash register,

160
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,830
by the 5-hour Energy drink.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Sure. That'd be fine.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,470
Come here.

164
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,990
Speaking of the business,

165
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,430
the story comes first.

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,910
The story is is that we are

167
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,910
car wash owners,

168
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,910
pure and simple.

169
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,860
But if our story is that

170
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,860
the car wash is successful,

171
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,150
then what do successful

172
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,150
car wash owners do?

173
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,320
They buy more car washes.

174
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,070
Listen.

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,550
Skyler, you'll be laundering

176
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,550
that money for years.

177
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,510
Decades.

178
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,480
Wouldn't two be better than one?

179
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,110
Well, there's Gentle Hands

180
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,110
over by Kirtland.

181
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,110
I do love that location.

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,070
I'll think about it.

183
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,060
Yeah. Right, right.

184
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,060
To be continued.

185
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,270
Okay.

186
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,470
Good morning.

187
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,470
Welcome to A-1.

188
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,270
Just the regular, please.

189
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,190
Well, we're having a special

190
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,190
on hand wax, 21.99

191
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,190
if you're interested

192
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,190
in getting rid of those water spots.

193
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,950
Just the regular is fine.

194
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,870
Okay. Well, there's complimentary

195
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,870
coffee inside while you're waiting.

196
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,350
Have an A-1 day.

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,390
Please give this to your

198
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,390
car wash professional,

199
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,390
and have an A-1 day.

200
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,750
Sixty-eight percent.

201
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,750
And falling.

202
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,950
Good morning.

203
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,950
May I have your ticket, please?

204
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,590
I knew there would be a drop

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,590
in quality, but 68 percent?

206
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,830
This is not what I agreed to.

207
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,830
I left a viable operation.

208
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,830
The rest was up to you.

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,230
May I have your ticket, please?

210
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,670
I'm only asking for a few days,

211
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,300
a week at most.

212
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,300
Call it a tutorial.

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,470
That's the standard wash.

214
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Fix this. Get the ship back on course.

215
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,840
We'll make it worth your while.

216
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,270
That'll be 14.95, please.

217
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Listen, this is a complicated situation.

218
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,680
There are a lot of moving parts.

219
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,150
None of which are my concern.

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,990
You're putting me in a box here.

221
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,350
You know what could happen.

222
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,350
Again, none of my concern.

223
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,990
There's your change, and if you'll hand

224
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,990
this to your car wash professional...

225
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,990
And have an A-1 day.

226
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Listen--

227
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,240
It'll only be a few more minutes.

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,870
There's some complimentary

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,870
coffee, if you like.

230
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,470
What's up?

231
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,990
Just wondering

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,990
who washes a rental car.

233
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,270
Walt, who was that?

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,350
She's a former business associate

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,550
who wants me to go back.

236
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,270
And I won't.

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,470
Enrique, this one's finished.

238
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,430
Get out of here.

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,630
Now.

240
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,430
Excuse me?

241
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,910
Never come back here.

242
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Do you understand me?

243
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,230
I--

244
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,230
Go.

245
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,750
Hey.

246
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,750
Hey.

247
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,190
Oh, thanks.

248
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,310
You going in today?

249
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,830
Uh, no. No, no.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,110
Good. You know, stay out of there

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,110
till you're sure you're better.

252
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,750
Yeah.

253
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,750
Stay home, rest,

254
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,710
don't even think about work.

255
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,710
Okay.

256
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,390
All right? I'll see you later.

257
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,390
All right.

258
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,230
Morning, Mrs. Schrader.

259
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,230
Hey, guys. What's going on?

260
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,190
Dropping these off.

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,190
Where'd you like them?

262
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,670
Bring them around

263
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,670
to the garage, guys.

264
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,670
I got it.

265
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,510
Have a good day.

266
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,230
You too.

267
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,670
Boss, Janice said to

268
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,670
tell you a few of them

269
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,670
might not have indexes.

270
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,910
We could give you a hand

271
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,910
sorting through them.

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,710
No, I got it, thanks.

273
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
All right.

274
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,070
- Well, see you, boss.

275
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,070
- Okay.

276
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,350

Dude, you are tripping. I'm not dead.

309
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,310
I'm on the starship Enterprise,

310
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,310
macking on Yeoman Rand

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,990
while the Andorian with the disruptor

312
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,990
is back on Talos IV, or whatever.

313
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,430
What do you think

314
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,430
all those sparkles and shit are?

315
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,470
Transporters

316
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,470
are breaking you apart, man.

317
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,990
Down to your molecules and bones.

318
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,990
They're making a copy.

319
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,710
That dude who comes out on the other

320
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,710
side? He's not you. He's a color Xerox.

321
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,230
So you're telling me every

322
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,230
time Kirk went into the transporter

323
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,230
he was killing himself?

324
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,950
So over the whole series,

325
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,950
there's, like, 147 Kirks?

326
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,950
At least. Dude, why do you

327
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,950
think McCoy never likes

328
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,950
to beam nowhere?

329
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,430
Because he's a doctor, bitch.

330
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,430
Look it up. It's science.

331
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,390
I ever tell you about

332
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,390
my Star Trek script?

333
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,070
Star Trek script?

334
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,070
Yeah. I gotta write it down, is all.

335
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,710
The Enterprise

336
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,710
is five parsecs out of Rigel XII.

337
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,390
Nothing's going on.

338
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,390
Neutral zone is quiet.

339
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,630
The crew is bored,

340
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,630
so they put on a pie-eating contest.

341
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,630
The whole crew's in the galley.

342
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,630
They're eating tulaberry pies.

343
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,590
Tulaberry?

344
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,590
Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.

345
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,440
That's Voyager, dude.

346
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,440
Okay, blueberries, then.

347
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,590
They're eating blueberry pies

348
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,590
Better.

349
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,270
as fast as the replicator

350
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,270
can churn them out:

351
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,750
Finally it's down to just three:

352
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,750
Kirk, Spock and Chekov.

353
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,350
Okay, Spock always wins

354
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,350
these things.

355
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,670
How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo?

356
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,670
Spock's like a toothbrush.

357
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,550
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

358
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,270
Spock has total Vulcan control

359
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,270
over his digestion.

360
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,270
You wanna hear this or not?

361
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,310
Yeah. Yeah, go.

362
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,310
Okay. Finally, Kirk,

363
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,200
he can't take it anymore.

364
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,200
He yorks.

365
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,110
Now it's just down

366
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,110
to Chekov and Spock.

367
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,910
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole

368
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,910
fat stack of quatloos riding on this

369
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,830
and he has figured out a way to win.

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,040
He's got Scotty back in the Transporter

371
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Room locked in on Chekov's stomach.

372
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,350
Every time Chekov eats a pie,

373
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,350
Scotty beams it right out of him.

374
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,070
Where's he sending them? The toilet?

375
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,070
Space.

376
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,110
Oh!

377
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,110
There's blueberries just floating out there,

378
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,150
frozen, because it's in space.

379
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,990
And Chekov is just

380
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,990
shoveling them into his mouth

381
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,630
and Spock's like, "I can't believe

382
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,630
this Russian is defeating me."

383
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,190
Meanwhile,

384
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,190
Scotty's in the Transporter Room

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,630
fiddling with levers

386
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,630
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in.

387
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,590
She's got, you know, her big pointies,

388
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,590
and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.

389
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,590
No.

390
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,590
Chekov screams.

391
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,350
He sprays blood out of his mouth.

392
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,470
Scotty beamed his guts

393
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,470
into space.

394
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,710
No way!

395
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,910
Hey, man, where you going?

396
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,910
You're missing the best part.

397
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,710
Just fill this out, bring it back to me.

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,590

smoke that up in here.

Yeah, Jesse Pinkman's

Pinkman. He'll see you now.

live and in person. Pull up

411
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,270
a bong and take a seat.

412
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,630
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.

413
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,630
Don't be doing that.

414
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,070
Uh, sorry to keep you

415
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,070
on ice out there, kid.

416
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,070
If I'd known it was you...

417
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,990
Well, that Francesca,

418
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,990
I've warned her before.

419
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,390
One more time

420
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,390
and it's back to the DMV.

421
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,910
So, uh,

422
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,910
are we on our own today?

423
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,830
Barn door open.

424
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,950
Barn door?

425
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,350
Oh.

426
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,190
So how is the maestro?

427
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,190
Things have been quiet

428
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,190
on this end.

429
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
I haven't seen him.

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,510
Just as well, probably.

431
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,350
That whole thing in the jails.

432
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,350
I mean,

433
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,630
when they start to whack lawyers,

434
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,630
that's when I draw the line.

435
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,430
This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut

436
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,150
and that goes to

437
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,150
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

438
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,220
315 East Pueblo.

439
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,220
It's up in White Horse.

440
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,670
It's 2 and a half million each.

441
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,670
Total of 5.

442
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,430
Mr. and Mrs. who?

443
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,870
Drew Sharp's parents.

444
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,630
Drew Sharp?

445
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,630
Uh, that's the kid on TV?

446
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,470
The missing--?

447
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,470
So but why would you--?

448
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Scratch that. Heh. I don't know,

449
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,720
and I don't wanna know. Uh...

450
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,190
The thing is, what those

451
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,190
folks want is to know

452
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,190
what happened to their boy.

453
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,470
A sack full of cash on

454
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,470
their doorstep? That's just

455
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,470
gonna raise more questions.

456
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,950
Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

457
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,950
That's Mike's granddaughter?

458
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,790
So this is Mike's money?

459
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,790
It's mine.

460
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,200
It's your money. Okay. And you're

461
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,200
giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

462
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,230
It's what Mike wanted.

463
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,390
So you and Mike, uh,

464
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,390
you've been in touch?

465
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,470
So we're just talking about charity?

466
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,310
Yeah.

467
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,750
Okay, look, you know, um,

468
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,750
shelling out money to the ex

469
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,750
and her little boy,

470
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,910
I kind of get it. I mean,

471
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,910
kind of. But this, ha, ha,

472
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,910
this is a bridge too far.

473
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm sorry to say, kid,

474
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,030
but you're still gonna be

475
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,030
two miracles short of sainthood.

476
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,030
Brass tacks.

477
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,030
Okay, my job is to advise,

478
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,750
and my advice is,

479
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,750
come on, already.

480
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,190
Mike left one step ahead

481
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,190
of the boys in blue.

482
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,510
You better believe

483
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,510
his family's on the radar.

484
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,550
A couple million bucks shows up,

485
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,550
they're gonna snatch it.

486
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,030
The feds have already taken

487
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,030
Kaylee's money twice.

488
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,590
What, are you going for a hat trick?

489
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,590
I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.

490
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,750
No, no, no!

491
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,750
I was just thinking out loud.

492
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,710
Enough bullshit, Saul.

493
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,710
Are you gonna do this or not?

494
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,070
Yes, yes. Absolutely. I live to serve.

495
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,200
And, kid, you might wanna

496
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,200
think about cleaning up a little,

497
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,200
getting some rest.

498
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
You've looked better.

499
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
Just get it done.

500
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,790
You know who this is?

501
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,790
Don't hang up on me.

502
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah, there's a problem.

503
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,150
There's 5 million of them

504
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,150
here in my office.

505
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,070
No, no, don't. Just hold on to it.

506
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,950
Yes.

507
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
Ye--

508
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes.

509
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,510
Calm down.

510
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,470
I'll handle it.

511
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,390
Déjà vu, huh?

512
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,070
Jesus.

513
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,510
All right, look,

514
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,230
you wanna talk me

515
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,230
through this?

516
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,630
What you were thinking?

517
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,230
What you asked Saul to do.

518
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,230
I mean, come on.

519
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,510
It's just nonsensical.

520
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,590
Do you--?

521
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,390
Do you have any explanation

522
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,390
at all?

523
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,430
Blood money.

524
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,430
What?

525
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,990
It's like you said.

526
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,870
It's blood money.

527
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
I sa--?

528
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,990
Jesus. Okay, yes, all right.

529
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,990
I said that.

530
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,920
I did.

531
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,230
But it was in the heat of the moment.

532
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,230
I was trying to win an argument.

533
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,910
All right? And I was wrong.

534
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,110
This is your money.

535
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,630
Come on, you've earned it.

536
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,470
Drew Sharp.

537
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,470
That is a terrible memory,

538
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,470
no doubt about it.

539
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,350
But, son,

540
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,460
you need to stop focusing

541
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,460
on the darkness behind you.

542
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,230
The past is the past.

543
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,830
Look, nothing can change

544
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,830
what we've done.

545
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,950
But now that's over.

546
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,630
You're out.

547
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,590
And so am I.

548
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,550
That's right. I'm done.

549
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,270
I've been out for about a month.

550
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,150
But there is nothing left

551
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,150
for us to do except to try

552
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,070
to live...

553
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,190
ordinary, decent lives.

554
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,230
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

555
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,840
She needs someone

556
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,840
looking after her.

557
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,030
Mike is perfectly capable

558
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,030
of looking after his own

559
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,030
granddaughter.

560
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,550
I don't think so.

561
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,350
I don't think he is capable.

562
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,110
I don't think he's coming back.

563
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,430
What--?

564
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,430
What are you saying?

565
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,950
You doing what you did,

566
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,990
offing Mike's guys?

567
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,750
If he was out there,

568
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,750
you'd have to look over your

569
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,750
shoulder for the rest of your life.

570
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,830
And that's not how you do things.

571
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,830
So I think he's dead,

572
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,590
and I think you know that.

573
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,870
I don't know that.

574
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,070
I don't.

575
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,350
Listen to me.

576
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,270
I did not kill Mike.

577
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,840
The last time that I saw him,

578
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,840
he had his bag,

579
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,840
the one that I brought him.

580
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,110
And he got into his car,

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,110
and he drove away.

582
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,310
And for all I know,

583
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,310
he's alive and well.

584
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,340
And if...

585
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,590
If he does come back and he doesn't

586
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,590
understand why I had to do what I did...

587
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,670
well, then, that's on me.

588
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,830
Jesse?

589
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,590
I need you to believe this.

590
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,630
It's not true. It's just not.

591
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,630
So he's out there?

592
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,140
He's okay?

593
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,800
Yes.

594
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,070
Mike is fine,

595
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,070
wherever he is.

596
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,350
We both know

597
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,350
that he can take care of himself.

598
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,950
And he's certainly capable

599
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,950
to provide for his own family. Okay?

600
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,750
Jesse.

601
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,520
I need you to believe me.

602
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah.

603
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,270
Like you said.

604
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,990
He's alive.

605
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah.

606
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,030
Mike's alive.

607
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,990
Absolutely.

608
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,230
You've got to have a counselor.

609
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,230
Are they bringing in someone new?

610
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,350
I don't know.

611
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,350
Um, maybe she'll be back.

612
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,630
What if she's not?

613
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,630
What are you supposed to do?

614
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,630
What's Louis gonna do?

615
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,350
He's not worried.

616
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,300
Oh, yeah, sure.

617
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,300
What's there to worry about?

618
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,300
It's only college, right?

619
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,830
Right.

620
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,560
College.

621
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,560
Nothing more important.

622
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,830
Oh, you know,

623
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,830
Uncle Hank's still not feeling well,

624
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,790
so bowling's off tomorrow night.

625
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
- Really?

626
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
- Really.

627
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
So you're spared

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
a night out with the family.

629
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,830
You do not have to look

630
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,830
so happy about it.

631
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,870
I'll be right back.

632
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Um...

633
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,430
So if bowling's off,

634
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,390
can I get a late curfew?

635
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,470
Are you gonna

636
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,470
turn off the light?

637
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,030
Have you seen

638
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,030
Leaves of Grass?

639
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,550
Hm?

640
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,630
My book.

641
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,950
Walt Whitman.

642
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,950
Dark green hardcover.

643
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,510
I didn't even know

644
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,510
we had that.

645
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,350
Hm.

646
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,590
You don't think Junior...?

647
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,790
You're kidding, right?

648
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,470
Well,

649
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,870
it'll show up.

650
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,990
What's wrong with Hank?

651
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,990
Mm...

652
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,510
It's a stomach bug, sounds like.

653
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,110
He hasn't been to work all week.

654
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,990
Well, good night.

655
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,080
Night.

656
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,590
Mister.

657
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,590
Can you help me out?

658
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,590
Spare some change?

659
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
Hey.

660
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,910
Come back.

661
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,310
Yeah. You. Come here,

662
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,310
I got something for you.

663
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,350
Here.

664
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,070
Take it.

665
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,910
Go ahead.

666
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,150
Just take it.

667
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,060
Take it.

668
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah.

669
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,470
Anything you want us

670
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,470
to tell Steve Gomez?

671
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,190
Says he's worried about you.

672
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,750
Yeah. Tell him I already

673
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,750
got two grandmas.

674
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,070
Listen, tell everybody

675
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,070
more work and less worry.

676
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,660
Guess we better hit it.

677
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,660
Yeah.

678
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
Yeah.

679
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,990
- Hey, guys.

680
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,990
- Walt.

681
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
How are you?

682
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
Good to see you.

683
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
How you doing?

684
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,230
Well, you know,

685
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,230
I can't complain. Heh, heh.

686
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,790
How's your son's arm?

687
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,790
I was thinking about that.

688
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,790
Back to 100 percent. Going to district.

689
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,470
Gonna be exciting.

690
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,470
This Saturday?

691
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,950
This Saturday morning.

692
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,950
I think first pitch is at 10 a.m.

693
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,940
Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun.

694
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,940
Should be a big crowd.

695
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,790
Guys, you're still

696
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,790
on the clock here!

697
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,790
Let's go.

698
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,510
- See you, Walt.

699
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,510
- See you, Artie.

700
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,390
All right, Scott.

701
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,390
Be well.

702
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,270
They're good guys, huh?

703
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,270
Yeah, they're good guys.

704
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,110
Well, it's good to see you up and about.

705
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,110
Yeah.

706
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,110
How are you feeling?

707
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,110
Well, you know. I've been better, but...

708
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,430
Yeah.

709
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,430
Have you--?

710
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,510
Did you get to see a doctor?

711
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,510
I mean,

712
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,270
when one of these things

713
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,270
lasts more than three days,

714
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,910
you really should get that checked.

715
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,910
Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine.

716
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,710
I'm, what they say,

717
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,710
on the upswing, you know?

718
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
Mm. Good. Good to hear.

719
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,520
Yeah.

720
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,110
When I heard you weren't

721
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,110
going in to work, I-- Well...

722
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,870
Looks like you have the work

723
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,870
coming to you.

724
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,390
Perks of being the boss,

725
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,390
huh?

726
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,790
Eh, you know...

727
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,310
How's, uh--?

728
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,470
How's things at the car wash?

729
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,310
Good.

730
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,310
Yeah?

731
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,790
Yeah, really good.

732
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,630
Hey, did you have

733
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,630
any of that potato salad?

734
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,750
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe.

735
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,750
Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick,

736
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,190
so I probably

737
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,190
shouldn't worry about it.

738
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,710
Well, Skyler will be very happy

739
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,710
to hear that you're feeling better.

740
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,470
Which reminds me,

741
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,470
I better get back to it.

742
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,510
If there's anything I can do...

743
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,800
Feel better.

744
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,910
You know...

745
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,910
you're gonna laugh,

746
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,910
but I have to ask you about this.

747
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,230
Believe it or not,

748
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,230
I found this on my car.

749
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,030
I mean, it looks just like

750
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,030
the GPS tracker that we used

751
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,030
on Gus Fring, doesn't it?

752
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,710
Back when we were tracking him,

753
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,710
just the two of us.

754
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,550
You wouldn't know anything

755
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,550
about this, would you, Hank?

756
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,390
You okay?

757
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,480
I gotta say, I don't like the way

758
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,480
you're looking at me right now.

759
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,910
It was you.

760
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,310
All along, it was you!

761
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,190
You son of a bitch.

762
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,750
You drove into traffic

763
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,750
to keep me from that laundry.

764
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,430
Calm down.

765
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,910
That call I got, telling me Marie

766
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,910
was in the hospital,

767
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,030
that wasn't Pinkman.

768
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,910
You had my cell number.

769
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,270
You killed 10 witnesses

770
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,270
to save your sorry ass.

771
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,150
Listen to me.

772
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,150
You bombed a nursing home.

773
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,790
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.

774
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,270
You lying,

775
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,270
two-faced sack of shit.

776
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,870
Hank.

777
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,110
Look, I don't know where this is

778
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,110
coming from, Hank, but just--

779
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,150
I swear to Christ,

780
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,870
I will put you under the jail.

781
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,870
Take a breath, okay? Listen to yourself.

782
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,230
These wild accusations, they could

783
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,230
destroy our family. And for what?

784
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
You don't give a shit

785
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
about family!

786
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,160
Hank, my cancer is back.

787
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,200
Good.

788
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,670
Rot, you son of a bitch.

789
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,870
I'm sorry you feel that way.

790
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,430
I wanna beat this thing, I do.

791
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,950
I'm back on chemo,

792
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,950
and I am fighting like hell.

793
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,110
But the truth is, in six months,

794
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,110
you won't have someone

795
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,110
to prosecute.

796
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,670
But even--

797
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,230
Even if somehow you were

798
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,230
able to convince anyone

799
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,230
that I was capable

800
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,230
of doing these things,

801
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,470
you and I both know I would

802
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,470
never see the inside of a jail cell.

803
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,950
I'm a dying man

804
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,150
who runs a car wash.

805
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,070
My right hand to God,

806
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,070
that is all that I am.

807
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,390
What's the point?

808
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,990
Have Skyler bring the kids here.

809
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,830
And then we'll talk.

810
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,500
That is not going to happen.

811
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,670
I don't know who you are.

812
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,750
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

813
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,590
If that's true...

814
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,430
if you don't know who I am...

815
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,630
then maybe your best course...

816
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,830
would be to tread lightly.
