[Bird cawing]

2
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,331
[Nan] The little lord's
been dreaming again.

00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,294
[Growling]

4
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,424
- We have visitors.
- l don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,094
Really?
If l was cooped up all day

6
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,222
with no one but this old bat
for company, l'd go mad.

7
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,809
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,854
- l don't want to go.
- Neither do l.

9
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,772
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

10
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,900
which means l do what he says,
and you do what l say.

11
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,070
Hodor!

12
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,660
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,787
Hodor.

14
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,338
[Tyrion] l must say l received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,049
[Robb] Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,760
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not l, eh, boy?

17
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,138
l'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,348
l'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,727
- Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
- [Door opens]

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,689
So it's true.

21
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,860
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,237
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,781
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,451
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,622
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,209
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,589
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,799
Well, l mean l did like to.

29
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,385
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,596
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,641
- l'm not a cripple.
- Then l'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,726
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,103
l have a gift for you.

34
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,106
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,528
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,990
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,078
- Will l really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,372
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,750
ls this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,380
l have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,633
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,718
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:06,932
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,893
There l'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,279
lf you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,323
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,701
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,912
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,250
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,128
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,005
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,632
M'lady? [Chuckles]

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,552
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,638
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,684
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,688
l still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,483
- l believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,778
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,408
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,786
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,291
l suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,711
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,671
- Careful, Imp.
- l've offended you.

65
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,008
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,011
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,305
l'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,682
and l've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,602
- [Coin clinks]
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,772
l'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,068
[Sighs]

72
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,029
[Jon] Shoulder, legs.

73
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,995
Leg, shoulder, leg.

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,998
Left foot forward. Good.

75
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,127
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

76
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,630
What in seven hells is that?

77
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,260
- [Pyp] They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
- [Laughter]

78
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,303
Tell them your name.

79
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,389
Samwell Tarly,

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,393
of Horn Hill...
l mean, l was of Horn Hill.

81
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,103
l've come to take the black.

82
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,856
- Come to take the black pudding.
- [Laughter]

83
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,859
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

84
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,902
Rast...

85
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,029
see what he can do.

86
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,495
[Yelps]

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,789
[Whimpers] l yield.

88
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,458
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,711
Pick up your sword.

90
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,463
Hit him till he finds his feet.

91
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,341
[Samwell yelping]

92
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,764
[Whimpering]

93
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,517
lt seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

94
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,353
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

95
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,772
- Again, harder.
- [Growns]

96
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,359
- [Shrieks] l yield!
- Enough!

97
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,404
- [Samwell sobbing]
- He yielded.

98
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,033
Looks like the bastard's in love.

99
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,871
All right then, Lord Snow,

100
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,166
you wish to defend your lady love,
Iet's make it an exercise.

101
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,252
You two. Three of you
ought to be sumicient

102
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,588
to make lady piggy squeal.

103
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,674
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

104
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,721
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

105
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,987
Yield, yield, yield!
l yield.

106
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,535
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

107
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,371
That's all you're good for.

108
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,876
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

109
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,087
[Spits]

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,717
- Did he hurt you?
- l've had worse.

111
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,805
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

112
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,934
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

113
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,646
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

114
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,024
l wanted to.

115
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,902
- l just couldn't.
- Why not?

116
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,614
l'm a coward.

117
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,785
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

118
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,871
You're right. l'm sorry.

119
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,749
l just...wanted to thank you.

120
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,720
A bloody coward.

121
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,932
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

122
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,851
You're too stupid to be a coward.

123
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,853
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

124
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,856
before summer's over. [Laughing]

125
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,983
Come here!

126
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,367
[Horse neighs]

127
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,723
- [Neighs]
- Hyah, hyah!

128
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:47,022
[Jorah] Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,652
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

130
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,280
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

131
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,699
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- l'll call them what l like,

132
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,578
because they're my people.
This is my army.

133
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,707
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

134
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,479
lf my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

135
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,149
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

136
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,069
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

137
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,363
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

138
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,073
But if they did?

139
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,578
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

140
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,289
but the men
advising him are dimerent.

141
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,751
- And you know these men?
- l fought beside them once,

142
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,795
long ago.

143
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,256
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

144
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,633
He drove me from my land.

145
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,345
You sold slaves.

146
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
Aye.

147
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,020
- Why?
- l had no money

148
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,230
and an expensive wife.

149
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,149
And where is she now?

150
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,484
ln another place,

151
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,820
with another man.

152
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,245
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

153
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,915
They call you the last dragon...

154
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,626
They do.

155
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,006
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

156
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,133
lt's entirely possible.

157
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,720
[Chuckles]
What happened to the dragons?

158
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,890
l was told that brave men
killed them all.

159
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,939
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

160
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,483
The brave men rode them.

161
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,986
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

162
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,572
this world has ever seen.

163
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,035
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

164
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,038
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

165
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,125
The swords of the vanquished,

166
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,378
a thousand of them...

167
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,841
melted together
like so many candles.

168
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,931
l have always wanted
to see a dragon.

169
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,560
There's nothing in the world
that l would rather see.

170
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,229
Really. Why dragons?

171
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,815
They can fly.

172
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,901
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

173
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,487
and they're somewhere else...

174
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,656
far away.

175
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,536
And they can kill.

176
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:52,749
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

177
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,461
- gets burned away to nothing...
- [Gasps]

178
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,297
..melted...

179
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,216
like so many candles.

180
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,926
Ow.

181
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,891
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

182
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,018
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

183
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,729
l imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

184
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,648
l was not locked in.
l have seen things.

185
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,483
- What have you seen?
- l've seen...

186
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,487
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

187
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,489
- Ooh.
- l've seen a man who could

188
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,286
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

189
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,998
And l've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

190
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,586
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

191
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,881
So...

192
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,468
have you seen one?

193
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,638
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

194
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,641
No.

195
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,269
No, the last one died
many years before l was born.

196
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,439
l'll tell you what l have seen -

197
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,734
their skulls.

198
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,820
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

199
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,364
When l was very young,
just three or four,

200
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,991
my father used
to walk me down the rows

201
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,369
and l'd recite
their names for him.

202
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,164
When l got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

203
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,167
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

204
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,839
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

205
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,469
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

206
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,848
they got bigger

207
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,976
and bigger and bigger.

208
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
There was Ghiscar

209
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,859
and Valryon,

210
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,735
Vermithrax,

211
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,029
Essovius... [Gasps]

212
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,574
I
..Archonei

213
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,994
Meraxes,

214
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,038
Vhagar...

215
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,793
- and Balerion the Dread...
- [Moans]

216
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:04,965
..whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,134
into one.

218
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,974
What happened to the skulls?

219
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,561
l don't know.

220
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,939
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, l expect.

221
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,901
Scattered to the wind.

222
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,824
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

223
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,245
What did l buy you for?

224
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,540
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

225
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,920
To, uh, teach your sister.

226
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,048
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

227
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,343
You think l bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

228
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,767
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

229
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,685
[Chuckles]

230
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,938
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

231
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,994
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

232
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,583
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

233
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:26,338
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

234
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,549
- What if l have a girl?
- Gods be good,

235
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,593
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

236
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,804
What if l only have girls?

237
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,806
l wouldn't worry about that.

238
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,101
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

239
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,144
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

240
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,605
But what if?

241
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,025
Well, if you only had girls,

242
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,654
l suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

243
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,448
And everyone would hate me.

244
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,617
Nobody could ever hate you.

245
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,495
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

246
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,998
Why would you say such a thing?

247
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,918
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

248
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,962
l've told you
a hundred times -

249
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,965
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

250
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,218
Do you remember your lessons?

251
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,017
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

252
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,687
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

253
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,606
And how many years
did it take to build...

254
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:30,027
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

255
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,405
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

256
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:37,784
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

257
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,621
Why were they killed?

258
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,249
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

259
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,460
l don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

260
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,713
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

261
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,467
- to forgive your father.
- No, l won't.

262
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,970
[Man] It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

263
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:02,309
The King's Tournament.
l assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

264
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,436
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

265
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,689
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

266
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,651
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

267
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,737
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

268
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,532
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

269
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,660
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

270
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,370
- l need more men.
- [Ned] You'll get 50.

271
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,373
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- l will?

272
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,918
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

273
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,964
l'll also give you
20 of my household guard

274
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,467
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

275
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,345
They will be put to good use.

276
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,473
The sooner this is over, the better.

277
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,309
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

278
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,564
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

279
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,441
[Littlefinger] And every inn
in the city is full

280
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,443
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

281
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,946
l'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

282
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,532
- Hmm.
- Now...

283
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,076
if there's nothing else, my lords?

284
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh, this heat.

285
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,799
On days like this,
l envy you northerners,

286
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,719
yOUr SUmmer SnOWS.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

287
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,513
l've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

288
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,308
Lord Arryn?

289
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:28,979
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

290
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:34,109
l took personal charge of his care,
but l could not save him.

291
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:39,990
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

292
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:44,620
l saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

293
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,583
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

294
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,379
l have been grand maester
for many years.

295
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,591
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

296
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,594
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

297
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,055
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

298
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,433
A book? What book?

299
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,938
Oh, l fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

300
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,565
A... A ponderous tome.

301
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:17,110
No, l'd like to read it.

302
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,533
The Lineages and Histories

303
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,827
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

304
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,956
with descriptions
of many high lords

305
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,084
and noble ladies

306
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,253
and their children.

307
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,897
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

308
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,693
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

309
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,362
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

310
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,699
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

311
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,160
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

312
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,496
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

313
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,292
As l said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

314
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,003
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

315
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,922
He did not, my lord.
And l did not presume to ask.

316
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,258
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

317
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,802
..did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

318
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,804
Nothing of import, my lord.

319
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:30,559
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

320
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,979
''The seed is strong,''
l think it was.

321
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,315
- ''The seed is strong''?
- Mmm.

322
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,692
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

323
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,446
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

324
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,615
For all the weight they're given,

325
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,452
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

326
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,580
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

327
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,707
What else could it be?

328
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,879
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

329

No, no, no, l don't think it likely.

The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

331
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,639
l've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

Yes, women, cravens...

Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

found himself

- l've taken enough of your time.

It's a great honour.

He says every swordsman
should study cats.

They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

He wants to be

00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,825
King Robert's bastard son.

465
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,078
[Robert laughing]

466
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,539
- [Woman] He likes that.
- [Women laughing]

467
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,002
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

468
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,171
- [Robert laughs]
- Should l leave it with...

469
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,883
- Shhh. Listen.
- [Women laughing]

470
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,552
Do you hear them?

471
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,391
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

472
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,935
- Guess.
- Three.

473
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,104
- [Laughter]
- Four.

474
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,442
He likes to do this when l'm on duty.

475
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,611
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

476
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:09,198
- [Door opens]
- [Laughter]

477
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,535
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do l have to forgive you?

478
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,037
Have you wronged me?

479
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,335
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, l've forgotten.

480
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,088
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

481
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,924
Ah.

482
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,967
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

483
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,262
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

484
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,182
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

485
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,601
They stopped liking it at the end.

486
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,896
That was a proper battle.

487
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,233
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

488
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:48,362
With his burning sword?
l'll remember that till the day l die.

489
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,657
l saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

490
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,409
lt was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

491
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:57,871
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- l doubt it.

492
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,457
- [Laughter]
- [Door opens]

493
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,295
[Robert] l'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

494
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,257
Let me smell it. Come here.

495
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,803
Can l leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

496
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,097
l don't serve Lord Stark.

497
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,310
[Laughter continues]

498
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,747
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

499
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,125
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

500
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,085
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

501
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,962
- Impossible!
- [Chuckles]

502
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,131
That's enough.

503
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,265
Sam's no dimerent from the rest of us.

504
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,894
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

505
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,438
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

506
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,274
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

507
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,860
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

508
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:13,488
- [Rast] You are in love, Lord Snow.
- [Laughter]

509
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,868
You girls can do as you please.

510
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,704
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

511
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,873
l'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

512
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,167
[Laughter]

513
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,006
[Snoring]

514
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,393
[Panting]

515
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,854
[Growling]

516
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,649
No one touches Sam.

517
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,165
What are you waiting for?

518
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,134
Attack him!

519
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,647
You get in there.

520
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,070
Hit me.

521
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,407
Go on, hit me!

522
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,492
[Shouts]

523
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,995
- l yield!
- [Laughter]

524
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,955
Yield. Yield.

525
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,207
l yield.

526
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,546
You think this is funny, do you?

527
00:36:56,258 --> 00:37:00,971
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

528
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,806
do you want a man at your back?

529
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,267
Or a snivelling boy?

530
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,194
[Sobbing]

531
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,326
You send this whore
to give me commands?

532
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,078
l should have sent you back her head!

533
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,414
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
l did as you asked.

534
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,542
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

535
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,836
Yes, Khaleesi.

536
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,050
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do l have to tell you?

537
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,929
- You do not command me.
- l wasn't commanding you.

538
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,639
l just wanted to invite you to supper.

539
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,891
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

540
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,602
- l had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

541
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,562
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

542
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:53,106
This stinks of manure. All of it.

543
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,108
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

544
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,694
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

545
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,447
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

546
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:05,285
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

547
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:11,041
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

548
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,378
- [Metal jangles]
- [Screams]

549
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,384
l am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

550
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:25,514
l am the wife of the great khal
and l carry his son inside me.

551
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:29,393
The next time you raise a hand to me

552
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,563
will be the last time you have hands.

553
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,567
[Thunder rumbles, rain falling]

554
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:43,740
l know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

555
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,243
l wouldn't doubt it.

556
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,537
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

557
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:53,750
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

558
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,253
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

559
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,715
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

560
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,469
- It's absurd.
- l didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

561
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,264
Why not?

562
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,183
Because l'm fat?

563
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,686
- No.
- But l like girls just as much as you do.

564
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,440
They might not like me as much.

565
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,612
l've never...been with one.

566
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,532
You've probably had hundreds.

567
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,575
No.

568
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,662
As a matter of fact,

569
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,332
l'm the same as you.

570
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,459
Yeah. Yeah, l...

571
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,294
l find that hard to believe.

572
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,922
l came very close once.

573
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,133
l was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

574
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,554
- Didn't know where to put it?
- l know where to put it.

575
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,515
Was she...

576
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,725
old and ugly?

577
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,478
Young and gorgeous.

578
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,898
A whore named Ros.

579
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,027
What colour hair?

580
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,863
- Red.
- Oh, l like red hair.

581
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,824
And her, um...

582
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,701
Her...

583
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,329
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

584
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,164
- Better.
- Oh, no.

585
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:21,338
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

586
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,844
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

587
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,930
And why is my surname Snow?

588
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,933
Because...

589
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,394
you're a bastard from the North.

590
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,815
l never met my mother.

591
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,609
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

592
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,820
l don't know if she's living or dead.

593
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,326
l don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

594
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,205
or a whore.

595
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,751
So l sat there

596
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:03,046
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

597
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,675
But l couldn't do it.

598
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:12,181
Because all l could think was
what if l got her pregnant

599
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:17,311
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

600
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:24,735
lt's not a good life for a child.

601
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,945
Ah, mmm.

602
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,200
So...

603
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,994
you didn't know where to put it?

604
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:37,372
[Laughing]

605
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,835
Enjoying yourselves?

606
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,797
You look cold, boys.

607
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:48,800
- [Door creaks]
- It is a bit nippy.

608
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,720
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

609
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,805
indoors.

610
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,599
lt's still summer.

611
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:59,478
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

612
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,440
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

613
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,068
l remember.

614
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,612
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

615
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,697
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

616
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,117
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

617
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,079
- l build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

618
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,250
l spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

619
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,127
during the last winter.

620
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:28,131
lt was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

621
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:31,468
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

622
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,388
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

623
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:37,140
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

624
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,769
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

625
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,021
Harder than you'll ever be.

626
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,607
They know their country
better than we do.

627
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,193
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

628
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:52,781
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

629
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:56,368
And we got caught in the open.

630
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,245
Wind so strong

631
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,416
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

632
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,294
lf you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

633
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:08,463
you lost a finger to the frost.

634
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,382
And all in darkness.

635
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,096
You don't know cold.

636
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,098
Neither of you do.

637
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,936
The horses died first.

638
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,650
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

639
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,946
Eating the horses was easy.

640
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,993
But later when we started to fall...

641
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,830
That wasn't easy.

642
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,793
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

643
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,423
- [Grabs]
- [Gasps]

644
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,051
Soft, fat boys like you.

645
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:59,139
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

646
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,728
Soon we'll have new recruits

647
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,106
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

648
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,192
for assignment,

649
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:14,780
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

650
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,490
but you'd be fools to believe it.

651
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,077
You're boys still.

652
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:23,789
And come the winter you will die...

653
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,334
like flies.

654
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,926
l hit him.

655
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,427
l hit the dragon.

656
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:39,805
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

657
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:42,516
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

658
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:46,687
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

659
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:50,816
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

660
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,401
No.

661
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,529
But the common people
are waiting for him.

662
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:59,908
lllyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

663
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:04,705
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

664
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,083
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

665
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,878
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

666
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,258
Home.

667
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,595
l pray for home too.

668
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:26,101
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

669
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,648
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

670
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,862
He'll never take us home.

671
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,199
[Crowd chattering and yelling]

672
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,123
[Horse whinnies]

673
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,967
Lovers' quarrel?

674
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,552
l'm sorry. Do l...?

675
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,055
Sansa dear
this is Lord Bae!lish.

676
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,307
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

677
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,352
l've known your mother a long, long time.

678
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:10,646
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

679
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,565
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

680
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,778
When l was a child, l was very small,

681
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,988
and l come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

682
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,243
SO yOU See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

683
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,037
l've been sitting here for days!

684
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,707
Start the damn joust
before l piss myself!

685
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,835
[Crowd cheering]

686
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,051
Gods, who's that?

687
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,554
[Littlefinger] Ser Gregor Clegane.

688
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,557
They call him the Mountain.

689
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,853
The Hound's older brother.

690
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:54,106
- And his opponent?
- [Littlefinger] Ser Hugh of the Vale.

691
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,066
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

692
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,776
Look how far he's come.

693
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,114
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

694
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,165
[Horse neighs]

695
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,780

[Fly buzzing]

699
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,112
Not what you were expecting?

700
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:31,245
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

701
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:35,040
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,670
The Hound was just a pup,

703
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,964
six years old maybe.

704
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,091
Gregor a few years older,

705
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,970
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

706
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:53,976
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

707
00:48:54,101 --> 00:49:00,190
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

708
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,609
Gregor's toy,

709
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,362
a wooden knight.

710
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,364
Gregor never said a word,

711
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,450
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

712
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:13,871
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

713
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,624
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

714
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,877
while his face melted.

715
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:28,051
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

716
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,722
- l won't tell anyone. l promise.
- No, please don't.

717
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,100
lf the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

718
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:39,521
l'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

719
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,075
[Knocking]

720
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,370
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

721
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,168
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

722
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:04,463
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

723
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:09,384
l thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

724
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:12,137
the ugliness with the wolves.

725
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,933
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

726
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,729
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

727
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,732
How is Sansa?

728
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,736
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

729
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,782
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

730
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:35,577
- What are you doing here?
- l might ask the same of you.

731
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,788
What is it you hope to accomplish?

732
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,749
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

733
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,252
and that's what l'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

734
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,004
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

735
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,757
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

736
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,635
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

737
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,388
lf that's my job, then so be it.

738
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,350
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

739
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:02,062
You take your orders
and you carry on.

740
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,106
l suppose it makes sense.

741
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:07,276
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

742
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,487
l was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

743
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,243
As was l.

- l'd rather throw myself down a well.

your last chance if you're heading North.

is the howling of wolves!

- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing l can do...

- [Coin clanks]
- ..to remedy this?

- My lord of Lannister!
