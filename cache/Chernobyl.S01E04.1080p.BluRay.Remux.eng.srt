They didn't redact

The Central Committee
is sending Legasov to Vienna.

What are they asking you to do?

524
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,608
Well, then you'd better
know what happened.

Yes.

530
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,794
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

531
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,505

532
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,758
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

What do you mean, you're not sure?

534

I've analyzed the data.

535
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,932
Toptunov was telling the truth.

536
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,435
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

537
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,648
I think
this article may have the answer,

538
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:02,068
but two pages have been removed.

539
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,992
You've seen this before.

540
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,246
Please, believe me when I tell you

541
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,831
that I had no idea
it could cause an explosion.

542
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,918
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

543
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,172
In 1975, at an RBMK reactor
in Leningrad,

544
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,510
a fuel channel ruptured.
The operators pressed AZ-5,

545
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,096
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

546
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,140
for a brief moment, it went up.

547
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,142
How is that possible?

548
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,688
Well, this was the very question posed
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

549
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,273
He's the one who wrote this article.

550
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,858
When an RBMK reactor runs
at low power,

551
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:44,569
it's notoriously unstable.

552
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,737
Prone to swings in reactivity.

553
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,116
Under normal circumstances,
the control rods

554
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,702
- can compensate for that.
- Under normal circumstances.

555
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:56,205
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

556
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,291
They pulled
almost all the control rods out

557
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,417
to bring the power back up.

558
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,919
This is what Volkov learned
from Leningrad.

559
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,131
If the boron control rods
are completely withdrawn

560
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,633
from the reactor,
when they're put back in,

561
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:11,012
the first thing
that enters the core isn't boron.

562
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,055
It's graphite.

563
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:20,688
The control rods have graphite tips
that displace water and steam.

564
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:25,359
So the reactivity doesn't go down.
It goes up dramatically.

565
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:26,777
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

566
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,196
Why on earth
would they press that button?

567
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:30,906
They didn't know.

568
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,869
LEGASOV: Volkov warned the Kremlin,

569
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,954
10 years ago.

570
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,123
(SIGHS)

571
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,752
But there could be no doubt
about the supremacy

572
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,920
of the Soviet nuclear industry.

573
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,631
Oh.

574
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,176
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

575
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,263
LEGASOV: When I saw
the reactor blown open,

576
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:57,183
I still didn't think
it could be this flaw in AZ-5.

577
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,187
Because the flaw will not lead
to an explosion

578
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:06,067
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

579
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,486
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

580
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,655
KHOMYUK: But not only their fault.

581
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:13,616
No.

582
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,370
Is that
what you're going to say in Vienna?

583
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,626
You can't possibly be that naive.

584
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,174
There are 16 RBMK reactors
running in the Soviet Union right now.

585
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,842
We have to fix them.

586
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,137
The only way to do that
is to go public,

587
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,264
force the Central Committee
to take action.

588
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:40,267
What you're proposing
is that Legasov humiliate a nation

589
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,270
that is obsessed
with not being humiliated.

590
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:45,106
We can make a deal with the KGB.

591
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,150
You'll leave this information out
in Vienna,

592
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:51,112
and they quietly
let us fix the remaining reactors.

593
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:54,782
A deal with the KGB? And I'm naive.

594
00:58:56,826 --> 00:59:00,246
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

595
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,873
KHOMYUK: You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

596
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,042
If that chance was mine...

597
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:06,377
But it isn't, is it?

598
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,464
I've known braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

599
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,259
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

600
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,595
Because when it's your life
and the lives of everyone you love,

601
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,807
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

602
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,392
It leaves you.

603
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:26,480
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

604
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,529
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

605
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:35,448
No.

606
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:37,616
He was a fireman.

607
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,537
He died two weeks after the accident.

608
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,206
I've been looking in on his widow.

609
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,793
She gave birth. A girl.

610
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,588
The baby lived for four hours.

611
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,049
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

612
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,968
but the baby absorbed it instead.

613
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:57,887
Her baby.

614
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,265
We live in a country

615
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,018
where children have to die
to save their mothers.

616
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:06,520
To hell with your deal.

617
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,025
And to hell with our lives.

618
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,362
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

619
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,921
