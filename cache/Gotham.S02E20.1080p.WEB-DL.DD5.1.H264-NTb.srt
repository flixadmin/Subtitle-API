Oh, my...

I don't know who you are anymore.

8
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,166
Please, that is
such a ridiculous cliché.

Thomas Wayne to shut down the program.

16
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:31,981
You're lying.

17
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:34,517
I needed to be sure
you were behind all this,

18
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,853

James Gordon.

You're dead.

35
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,061
Not anymore.

38
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:25,756
You are upsetting the inmates.

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,958
Where's your boss, darling?

40
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,125
We got a warrant to search his office

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,703
and everything in it.

42
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:31,796
He's busy with patients.

43
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,676
That's quite all right, Ms. Peabody.

44
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,715
We're gonna tear

45
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:38,055
this place apart, Strange.
We're gonna get answers.

46
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:39,652
Answers to what?

47
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:41,885
Records indicate Theo Galavan's

48
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,277
dead body was brought here, that it was

49
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:44,292
cremated.

50
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:45,793
Seems likely.

51
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,428
Then why the hell was he at the GCPD

52
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,530
last night, running our captain

53
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,330
through with a sword, huh?

54
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,756
I'm as surprised as you are.

55
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,450
And while you're at it,
explain to me this:

56
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,535
why Victor Fries, also
last seen here, very dead,

57
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:58,006
is alive and kicking

58
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,874
and dressed like a spaceman.

59
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:03,210
You stink, Strange.

60
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,445
This whole damned place stinks.

61
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:07,114
Excuse me.

62
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:10,418
Is this your office?

63
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,853
STRANGE: Yes, but, Detective, please...

64
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,157
What the...?

65
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,491
Shredded?

66
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:19,027
Son of a...

67
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,895
Spring cleaning.

68
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,362
You're free to look around.

69
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:25,133
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

70
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:30,170
You think shredding a few
documents is gonna save you?

71
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:31,171
It won't.

72
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,729
We're on to you.

73
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:35,409
Bad guys come in and monsters come out.

74
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,422
Just like Pinewood, right?

75
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,581
Seeing as how you no longer work
for the police department,

76
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:45,287
I'm not required to speak
with you, Mr. Gordon.

77
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:51,159
You have a lot of anger, James Gordon.

78
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,228
I can help you with that.

79
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:57,564
We're gonna tear this
damn building apart,

80
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:59,067
every square inch!

81
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,434
Check your warrant, Detective.

82
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:02,337
It clearly states
that you have permission

83
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:05,073
to search my office, nothing more.

84
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:08,208
Of course, I'm more than
happy to accommodate you

85
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:10,211
if you come back with
a different warrant.

86
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,479
Just know that I will
also be calling the judge

87
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,952
and telling him how disruptive it is

88
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,416
to have the GCPD... and others...

89
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,988
traipsing about this place
of healing and disrupting

90
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,158
the patients unnecessarily.

91
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,724
This ain't over yet.

92
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,590
Has Azrael returned?

93
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:36,680
Nope.

94
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,512
Troubling.

95
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,450
(elevator bell dings)

96
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,527
ORDERLY: Hey, hey!

97
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:02,095
What are you doing out of your cell?

98
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,131
Big mistake.

99
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:04,599
Sorry, my bad.

100
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,599
Just got lost.

101
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,968
Escort me back, would you?

102
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,371
Thank you.

103
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:15,010
Thank you, have a nice day.

104
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:19,294
(exhales)

105
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,449
I've got to get out of here.

106
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,393
Huh.

107
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,364
(laughs)

108
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,666
(siren wails, bell chimes)

109
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,506
Damn kids.

110
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,659
Did you break the lock?!

111
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,377
Hey, you!

112
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,676
This is God's house, a place of worship,

113
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:54,856
not a homeless shelter.

114
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,185
Get out before I call the cops.

115
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,691
I need a weapon to
fulfill my holy quest.

116
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,492
I don't have any weapons.

117
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,026
Oh...

118
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:09,129
then what good are you?

Captain Nathaniel Barnes remains

121
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,048
in critical condition at Gotham General

122
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,850
after suffering a violent attack

123
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,628
by a masked assailant late last night.

124
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,558
So far no arrests have been made,

125
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,040
but reports coming from
within the locked down

GCPD have confirmed that the masked man

00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:44,164
is, in fact, former
Gotham mayor Theo Galavan.

128

Search parties continued

129
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,486
throughout the night, but, as of yet,

130
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,265
Galavan's whereabouts remain a mystery.

131

There's nowhere to hide, Galavan.

BULLOCK: <i>Alvarez, any sign of him yet?</i>

134
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,684
No, but we've got
six choppers in the air

135
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,531
and every sniffer dog in
the state out there looking.

136
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:14,400
Call the brass upstate,

137
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,760
tell them to get more men down here.

138
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,225
That freak couldn't have gotten far.

139
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,665
Tom,

140
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,090
get Judge Bam Bam on the phone.

141
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:22,804
Tell him I need a new warrant
to search Arkham,

What are they all doing?

145
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:37,279
They don't have a captain, Harvey.

146
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:39,168
Guess you're it.

147
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,056
I ain't no captain.

148
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,770
Say something to them.

149
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:44,691
I don't work here anymore, you do.

150
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,891
All right, everyone, listen up.

151
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,670
I know we're all a bit
freaked out right now.

152
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:55,896
It's understandable, hmm?

153
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:59,421
Some nutjob in
a Halloween costume and cape

154
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:03,160
comes into our house and takes
out four of our brothers?!

155
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,782
He does this to our captain?!

156
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:09,751
Now, I've been around a long time.

157
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,967
It's like the bad guys in this town

158
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,661
just keep getting weirder and weirder,

159

160
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,362
is just a man,

161
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,855
and he can bleed,

162
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,606
just like you and me,

163
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:26,446
and if he bleeds, he can be beaten.

164
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:29,172
So, let's do what the cap

165
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,682
would tell us to do if he were here.

166
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,845
Let's go out there

167
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,071
and let's find that son of a bitch

168
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:37,476
and let's get him, whatever it takes!

169
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,880
(officers affirming)

170
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,021
I'm not one for speeches.

171
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,540
No, no, no, you did fine.

172
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:50,923
But?

173
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:54,196
If that was Galavan that I saw,

174
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,597
he'll know how to stay out of sight.

175
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,433
We got to think outside the box.

176
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,466
Like what?

177
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,736
Who knows him best
who's still in the city?

178
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,857
His sister.

179
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:06,743
BRUCE: <i>Alfred, pull over.</i>

180
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:07,744
(tires screech)

181
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,180
(car horn honking)

182
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,583
Master Bruce, are you out
of your tiny, bloody mind?

183
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,047
There's a madman loose on the streets.

184
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,061
Now is not the time to go
running around on your own,

185
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,095
is it?

186
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,480
I don't plan on being on my own.

187
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:25,193
With all due respect, sir,
what good will a 15-year-old

188
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:27,239
little girl do even
if Galavan does turn up?

189
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,813
Strange lied to the police.

190
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,485
I know it, a-and so do you.

191
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:32,234
I can't stay at home and do nothing.

192
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,635
We need to trust Jim Gordon.

193
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:36,338
I'm tired of trusting
Jim Gordon, aren't you?

194
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,622
I am your guardian, Master Bruce,

195
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,337
and it is my job

196
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,415
to protect you.

197
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,910
Is it your job to watch me

198
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,412
sit on my hands and do nothing?

199
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,118
Alfred, please.

200
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,390
(horns honking)

201
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,423
Let me go.

202
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,837
MAN: Hey, buddy, move your car!

203
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,295
(horns honking)

204
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,065
Just... just be careful, all right?

205
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,578
I will.

206
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,169
MAN: Hey, let's go!

207
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:09,572
Yeah, all right, mate, keep...

208
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:11,080
just keep your bloody hair on!

209
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,415
Don't go, baby, come on,
let's talk about this, huh?

210
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,290
Is this because I-I kicked Barbara out?

211
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:16,618
Just let me go, Butch.

212
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,084
Come on, I'll do whatever you want.

213
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,082
I-I-I'll eat more fruit.
I-I'll work on the snoring,

214
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,284
I swear to God, whatever you need...

215
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:22,837
BULLOCK: Catch you guys at a bad time?

216
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:24,883
Seriously, how do people
keep getting in here?!

217
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,415
Do I have no security at all?!

218
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,996
Why the rush?

219
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:29,591
Just time to move on.

220
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,737
Oh, yeah, is that it?

221
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,861
Or are you worried Galavan's
coming after you, too?

222
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,797
Don't worry, Butch.

223
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,207
It's not about you.

224
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,821
She's just scared of her brother.

225
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,767
Come on, help me find him.

226
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,540
You two hardly left
on the best of terms.

227
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,717
Must have been weird,
seeing your dead brother

228
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:49,374
show up dressed like a
ninja from Medieval Times.

229
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:00,158
That thing that stabbed
your captain last night...

230
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,495
wasn't my brother.

231
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:06,058
It was a 300-year-old
assassin called Azrael.

232
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,832
Azrael?

233
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,491
That image I saw on the news,

234
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,385
his clothes, the way he moved...

235
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,461
it was Azrael.

236
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,409
A mythical figure
worshipped by the monks

237
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,441
who raised my brother.

238
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,838
A cold-hearted killing machine
sent into the night

239
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,612
to kill his master's enemies...

240
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,774
and he wants you.

241
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,022
An ancient assassin?

242
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:28,683
A legend.

243
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,525
My family used to tell stories of him.

244
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,211
He was real?

245
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:34,555
Who knows.

246
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,133
It was 300 years ago.

247
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,626
Probably, yes.

248
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,270
So, your brother's gone nuts?

249
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,254
You tell me.

250
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,252
Theo convince you that
he was Azrael last night,

251
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,344
or was he acting?

252
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,969
Someone got inside my brother's head.

253
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,509
It's not a safe place to be.

254
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,345
If you're right,
I want to find this person,

255
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,187
but first I have to find your brother...

256
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,566
so help me.

257
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,011
If a search team finds him,
they're gonna

258
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,271
kill him.

259
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,713
GORDON: He is still
your brother, after all.

260
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,313
He's blood.

261
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,193
The sword that was used last
night, the one that broke...

262
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,327
it was fake.

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
And you know this how?

264
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,511
The real one belonged to my grandfather.

265
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:22,239
He was an antiquities collector,
obsessed with Dumas history.

266
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,576
I saw it once; it was beautiful.

267
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,265
Forged by the monks themselves.

268
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:30,476
It's said to hold supernatural powers.

269
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,377
Theo knew this.

270
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,145
It's possible he'll
attempt to steal it back.

271
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,117
Does your grandfather still have it?

272
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,218
And where is he?

273
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,886
Gotham Cemetery.

274
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,464
He's been dead for 20 years...

275
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,064
but he was buried with his treasures.

276
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,512
Selina?

277
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,177
(exhales) 'Sup?

278
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,712
I remember you telling me

279
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,075
you're still feeding
your friend's birds.

280
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:17,858
Someone has to.

281
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,362
Why you here?

282
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:21,834
Have you seen the news?

283
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,427
Walking zombies in Gotham?

284
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,099
What's new?

285
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,735
Strange worked for my father

286
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,170
on a project designed to help people.

287
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,239
He perverted it and now
I believe he's found a way to...

288
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,464
Bring back the dead?

289
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,540
A little far-fetched, don't you think?

290
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,875
Perhaps, but he's hiding something.

291
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,368
The police failed to find out what.

292
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,682
I think I can do better.

293
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:41,387
That so?

294
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,010
When my father shut down
Strange, he was killed.

295
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,971
Selina, I just want the truth,
that's all.

296
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:52,438
You just won't be happy

297
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,743
until you get yourself killed, will you?

298
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,861
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham

299
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,294
as dead men. Both returned.

300
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:58,732
I don't care.

301
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:00,439
So did your friend Bridget.

302
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,947
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

303
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,991
She may still be there right now.

304
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,535
Alive.

305
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,314
(exhaling)

306
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,485
I told her to leave town,

307
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:22,583
to run, but she didn't listen.

308
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,314
It's my fault she's there.

309
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:29,603
Selina, we can put this right.

310
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:33,298
Strange was ready for the police.

311
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,033
He may even have been tipped off.

312
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,401
The only way we're gonna find out

313
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,122
what's really going on in there...

314
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:40,230
is if we break in ourselves.

315
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,503
Break in?

316
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:44,688
To Arkham?

317
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:46,676
A highly guarded place

318
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,446
that's packed with crazy people?

319
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:52,115
If it's too dangerous for you,
I'll just go myself.

320
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,243
I didn't say that.

321
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,391
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in.

322
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,392
It can be done.

323
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,550
It's a loony bin, not a prison.

324
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:06,470
I know it can be done.

325
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,010
But I go alone.

326
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,332
Why?

327
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:13,829
If I get caught,
they'll just toss me out.

328
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,931
Nobody cares about me.

329
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:17,909
But you? They see you coming

330
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,277
and they'll shut that whole thing down

331
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,408
quicker than you can say "rat."

332
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,118
And then you'll never find out
what they've been up to.

333
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:27,487
That or...

334
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,321
they'll just kill you.

335
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Besides...

336
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,950
I already know a way in.

337
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,729
This is it.

338
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,685
The Dumas crypt.

339
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,217
Dozens of my relatives are buried here.

340
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,200
So does someone have a key?

341
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,894
All right. Key, crowbar.

342
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,816
(mice squeaking and scurrying)

343
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,222
This one.

344
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,849
My grandfather's.

345
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,763
Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,628
I'm sure we're breaking more
than a few laws right now.

347
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,196
Really? This is where you draw the line?

348
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,591
Come on.

349
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,833
This doesn't creep you out,
even a little bit?

350
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:44,921
It's friggin' grave robbing!

351
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,586
Whatever it takes, Harvey.

352
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,686
(clanks loudly)

353
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,230
Little help?

354
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,601
(groans)

355
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,149
That was said to be Azrael's
sword up until the end.

356
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:18,967
He died?

357
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:20,706
No, he disappeared.

358
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,954
Azrael's thought to be immortal.

359
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:35,146
GORDON: It's beautiful.

360
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,726
THEO: I will take that.

361
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,945
(Bullock grunts)

362
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,514
(glass shattering)

363
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,921
(Gordon grunting)

364
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:51,957
(yells, groans)

365
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,625
James Gordon.

366
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:55,594
- (groaning)
- Time...

367
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:57,428
to...

368
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,064
die!

369
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:06,572
Step aside. He must die.

370
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:07,971
It's me, brother.

371
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:09,908
Don't you recognize me?

372
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,043
My quarrel is not with you.

373
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,711
Step aside.

374
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:15,657
Tabitha.

375
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,983
Your sister.

376
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,955
I have what you're looking for.

377
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,219
(panting)

378
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,364
(door rattles)

379
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:52,683
Tabitha?

380
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,864
That's right.

381
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,485
You remember where we grew up?

382
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,190
The estate by the sea?

383
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,326
Before the monks took you.

384
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,675
Our dogs, the horses?

385
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:20,980
We were happy once.

386
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,697
You are Theo Galavan.

387
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:29,537
My brother.

388
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:33,825
(softly): Theo?

389
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,809
(exhales)

390
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:37,647
Yes.

391
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:42,676
(cheering and applause)

392
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,050
DENT: Theo Galavan, the new mayor...!

393
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,355
Do you remember now?

394
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,144
MONKS: Death to the Son of Gotham.

395
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:54,033
Death to the Son of Gotham.

396
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,515
Bruce Wayne.

397
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:01,746
We were sent to kill him.

398
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,856
Yes, yes, but...

399
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,981
He dishonored our family name.

400
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,793
Yes.

401
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:10,261
Death to the Son of Gotham.

402
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,596
(grunts)

403
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,270
(grunting)

404
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:28,008
(groaning)

405
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:33,163
Thank you for reminding me.

406
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,034
Traitor.

407
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,431
(groaning)

408
00:19:45,277 --> 00:19:47,880
(siren wailing in distance,
men talking indistinctly)

409
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,082
GORDON: Harvey?

410
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,817
He's gone!

411
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:21,277
This is Bullock.

412
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,386
I need a backup down at the cemetery.

413
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,655
Galavan's in the wind again.

414
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,189
Okay.

415
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,226
(coughs)

416
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,429
(strained): I'm sorry.

417
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:32,963
I made him remember.

418
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,304
Remember what?

419
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,724
Bruce.

420
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,411
"Death to the Son of Gotham."

421
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:44,953
Stay with her. I need to find Bruce.

422
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,145
(phone ringing)

423
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:03,160
(sirens wailing in distance,
phone beeps)

424
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,169
Hey!

425
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,005
- Slow down!
- (tires screech)

426
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:15,073
I need this car.

427
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:17,345
- You ain't a cop anymore, Gordon.
- I need the damn car!

428
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:25,660
(gate door buzzes open)

429
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:40,397
(dogs barking in distance,
men talking indistinctly)

430
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:19,770
(breathing heavily)

431
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:24,613
(exhales)

432
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,822
(rats squeaking)

433
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,773
(squish)

434
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,313
Ugh.

435
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,080
(sneezing)

436
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,519
(squeaking)

437
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:11,488
(groaning)

438
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:20,530
- (engine revving)
- (line ringing)

439
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,800
Come on, come on.

440
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,768
- (stone scraping)
- (phone ringing)

441
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:31,841
Master Bruce?

442
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:34,033
No, it's me. Where's Bruce?

443
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,279
I don't know. He was in the city.

444
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,149
- Where in the city?
- Well, to be perfectly honest,

445
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:39,883
I haven't got the foggiest.
He's got a mind of his own

446
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,151
at the moment, that one, doesn't he?

447
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,720
All right, well, we need to find him.

448
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,722
Galavan could be coming after him.

449
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:46,290
Well, you're having a laugh, ain't you?

450
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:47,624
I thought he was after you.

451
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:50,761
He was. Tabitha
must have jogged his memory.

452
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,229
Reminded him of his original mission:

453
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:54,794
kill Bruce Wayne.

454
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:57,767
Right. Well, I'll-I'll get the motor.

455
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,336
No, no, no. You stay there

456
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,771
in case he comes back.

457
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:02,640
Where was the last place
you saw him in the city?

458
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,266
Uh, Collins and Delaney.

459
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:06,276
Last I saw of him,
he was headed for the roof

460
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,811
to see that Selina, I reckon.

461
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:09,479
All right, I'll head over there.

462
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:10,848
(door creaking)

463
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,117
Till then, be safe.

464
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:14,980
Righto.

465
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,549
Will do.

466
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:22,226
Oh, for Pete's sake, Master Bruce.

467
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,460
Creeping up on someone like
that, I could have filleted you.

468
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:25,494
Sorry.

469
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:27,731
What's wrong?

470
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:29,733
Galavan, Master Bruce.

471
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,083
Theo bloody Galavan is what's wrong.

472
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,275
(chatter, laughter echoing)

473
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:50,287
Okay. Okay.

474
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:51,955
- (shouts)
- (shouts) Holy cow!

475
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:54,624
What the... Forensic guy?

476
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,710
- Street trash girl?
- You framed Gordon.

477
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,389
And you tried to get
a reward by turning him in.

478
00:24:58,421 --> 00:24:59,503
Oh, yeah.

479
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:00,529
What the hell are you doing here?

480
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,300
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

481
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,323
I got to get out of here.
This place is crazy.

482
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,101
They're probably looking for me.
Which way is out of here?

483
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,272
I'll help you if you help me.

484
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,312
(sighs)

485
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,962
Where's Strange right now?

486
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:19,965
Okay, look, I barely know you,

487
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,700
but that is the <i>last</i> person
that you want to be looking for.

488
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:23,968
Why is that?

489
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:25,837
The basement here,

490
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,572
it's horrible.

491
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:29,573
Just trust me, stay away.

492
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:31,076
- He's a very dangerous man.
- Basement?

493
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,946
Alive people, dead people,

494
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,715
dead-alive people... it's horrible.

495
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,917
- Okay, how do I get there?
- Wow, it's like I'm saying things,

496
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,284
and you're just not hearing them.

497
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:42,715
He has a friend of mine,
and I'm here to get her out.

498
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:44,956
Now,

499
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:48,428
how... do... I get... there?

500
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:51,663
You'll tell me the way out?

501
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:52,997
Yes.

502
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,599
Okay.

503
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,267
There's an elevator.

504
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,736
I'll tell you where it is, but...

505
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,805
can you pick a lock?

506
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:02,908
(scoffs)

507
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,876
(sirens wailing,
horns honking in distance)

508
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:10,946
(monitor beeping steadily)

509
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,467
Why'd you have to be brave, huh?

510
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:20,888
I just got used to you being around.

511
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:23,595
Partners, right?

512
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:31,003
How am I supposed
to keep people in line now, huh?

513
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,279
I don't think I can do this without you.

514
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:38,503
You're one of the only people
in the world

515
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:41,647
who looks me in the eye
when they talk to me.

516
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,213
You know that?

517
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,454
You laugh at my jokes.

518
00:26:50,231 --> 00:26:52,891
(chuckling): You actually
like the way I look.

519
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,565
I didn't think
I'd ever feel like this again.

520
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:04,688
(shuddering breath)

521
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,609
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

522
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:15,813
(crying)

523
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:18,884
OSWALD: Well, don't stop now.
I was just getting misty.

524
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,021
What are you doin' here?

525
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:25,888
Paying my respects.

526
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,096
(clicks tongue)

527
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,099
She's looked better, I must say.

528
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,033
You will not hurt her.

529
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,574
(scoffs) Why would I do that?

530
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,309
Oh. I know.

531
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:44,943
Because she stabbed

532
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,178
my mother in the back!

533
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,750
If you touch her,

534
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,150
I will kill you.

535
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:54,270
(chuckles)

536
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,088
I like this new side of you.

537
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:00,357
Soft, sentimental.

538
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,262
He has to pay, Butch.

539
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:06,996
Who?

540
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:08,165
Azrael?

541
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:11,268
No! Galavan! See,

542
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:12,904
I will not buy

543
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:15,240
this whole uber-villain nonsense.

544
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,007
I mean, if he wanted to wear leather,

545
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,275
he should just wear leather.

546
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,745
This is Gotham City.
No one cares, right?

547
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,414
(chuckles)

548
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:26,496
We have all suffered by his hand.

549
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,232
Me,

550
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:29,512
you,

551
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,298
my mother.

552
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,056
And now

553
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,104
his own sister.

554
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:39,264
Galavan must die.

555
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:41,824
(sniffles)

556
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,216
And when he does,

557
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:50,344
you'll leave us alone?

558
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,447
(grunts) I suppose. (chuckles)

559
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,180
Promise.

560
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:58,917
(groans) Geez.

561
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:00,884
Fine. Yes.

562
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:01,985
Whatever.

563
00:29:02,018 --> 00:29:03,736
Where is he?!

564
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:06,091
(phone rings)

565
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:07,824
Yeah.

566
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,159
ALFRED: He's here,

567
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:10,228
and he's safe.

568
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,495
Thank God.

569
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,031
I'm coming.

570
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,302
(tires screeching)

571
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:21,005
(engine revving)

572
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,184
You're more to me
than just a guardian, Alfred.

573
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:36,063
You're my friend.

574
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:38,422
Your timing really is quite...

575
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:40,323
impeccable, Master Bruce.

576
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,092
But we haven't got time for...

577
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:43,862
sentimental nonsense right now.

578
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,230
We have to make sure
that all the doors are locked,

579
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,898
all the windows are closed,
and the lights are off

580
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,365
to make it as hard
as possible for Galavan

581
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:49,900
to find us, do you get me?

582
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,536
Detective Gordon's sure
he's coming here?

583
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:53,404
Nothing's certain, is it?

584
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,030
So we need to be ready.

585
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:56,339
Okay.

586
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:58,600
It's a big house. We should split up.

587
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:00,664
Fine.

588
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:03,281
But just you be quick.

589
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:05,550
<i>So, you take the upstairs.</i>

590
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,351
<i>I will take the downstairs.</i>

591
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:09,354
<i>You make sure the windows are closed.</i>

592
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,488
<i>You make sure the doors are locked.</i>

593
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,490
<i>You make sure the skylights are closed.</i>

594
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,958
<i>And then you meet me down here
as quick as you can</i>

595
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:16,961
<i>in the study, all right? Now go.</i>

596
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,929
(bird calling in distance)

597
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,367
Alfred! Alfred!

598
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,802
(beeping)

599
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:26,771
(stone scraping)

600
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,641
THEO: Ingenious.

601
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:37,048
- (beeping)
- (stone scraping)

602
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,285
You,

603
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,887
you will show me to the boy.

604
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,123
Over my dead body.

605
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:49,493
As you wish.

606
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,422
(distant groaning, laughter)

607
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,171
Check it out.

608
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,075
(rattling)

609
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,044
GUARD: What's that noise?

610
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,614
Hey, Ed. What's that noise?

611
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,451
Nygma!

612
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,719
Son of a...

613
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,723
(clicking)

614
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:33,228
Nygma.

615
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,762
(rattling)

616
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:38,663
Sound the alarm.

617
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,400
We got a runner!

618
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:42,368
Go!

619
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,746
(alarm ringing, whooping)

620
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,428
Come on, come on, come on.

621
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:10,451
Whoa.

622
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:11,761
Okay, great.

623
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:19,139
(hissing)

624
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,514
(panting) Okay.

625
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,154
(whirring)

626
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:31,941
Alfred! Alfred...

627
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,755
Alfred!

628
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,424
Take one more step, mate,

629
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,617
and I will put a bullet
right between your bloody eyes.

630
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:44,563
You think that'll stop me, manservant?

631
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:46,419
I'd like to give it a go,
if you don't mind.

632
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:48,724
Think I'm flesh and blood? I am immortal

633
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:50,886
and I have grown tired of you!

634
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,050
(gunshots)

635
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:54,841
(grunting)

636
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,476
- Oh!
- Alfred!

637
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,810
Run, Bruce!

638
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:59,778
(grunting)

639
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:03,602
Immortal? Let's see, shall we?

640
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,150
(grunting)

641
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,536
(Alfred shouting)

642
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:38,966
(yells)

643
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,555
Alfred!

644
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,872
Come on, come on.

645
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,707
(honking)

646
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,676
(indistinct shouting in distance)

647
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,467
(door closes)

648
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,318
Give us a minute, please.

649
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,006
I think we can safely say
Azrael has gone rogue.

650
00:34:54,298 --> 00:34:57,301
I'm not comfortable
making that assumption just yet.

651
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,839
But it's been more than 24 hours
since he's made contact.

652
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:03,240
Perhaps that's because
Jim Gordon still breathes.

653
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:05,975
But if the police catch him
first, how do we explain...

654
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:08,646
Something that cannot be explained?

655
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:10,146
We don't.

656
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,982
Theo Galavan is no more.

657
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:14,184
Azrael is his new creation.

658
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,352
A killer, a madman.

659
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:19,622
The GCPD will fail
if they try to capture him.

660
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:22,058
They'll have to kill him first.
And when they do,

661
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:24,695
they'll be successfully
covering our tracks for us.

662
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:27,164
In the meantime, this facility
needs to be shut down.

663
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:29,220
All subjects moved to the new location.

664
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:30,667
Already happening.

665
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,681
That's my girl.

666
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,232
(shouting in distance)

667
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:54,057
(indistinct shouting, electric buzzing)

668
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,162
(grunting)

669
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:30,781
Damn it.

670
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:37,754
(door opens in distance)

671
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,782
(metal scraping)

672
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:44,766
Don't hide, little boy.

673
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:46,682
Face me.

674
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,047
Face... death.

675
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,320
(metal scraping)

676
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:54,668
You know the Waynes were a blight

677
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:56,139
upon this city?

678
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,308
A selfish,

679
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,610
arrogant family.

680
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:05,350
A family with no beliefs.

681
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:07,423
No honor.

682
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:12,189
No respect.

683
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:18,162
You're your father's only son, Bruce.

684
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,918
When I kill you,

685
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:23,335
I eradicate the Wayne name...

686
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,672
forever.

687
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:37,555
It will be as though
you had never existed.

688
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,106
(engine starts)

689
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:29,003
Enough fun and games.

690
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:33,129
(grunts)

691
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,703
Prepare to die.

692
00:38:37,038 --> 00:38:38,751
(gunshot)

693
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,075
(grunting)

694
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:46,607
Unexpected.

695
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,226
(coughing)

696
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:02,664
You okay?

697
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,000
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

698
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,571
Seems like I missed all the fun.

699
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:07,805
Where have you been?

700
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,656
I slowed him down for you, didn't I?

701
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:11,187
GORDON: I'll call Bullock.

702
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:18,112
Time I taught you
how to drive, Master Bruce.

703
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:20,181
(grunting)

704
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,094
OSWALD: You should know by now

705
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,531
that bullets don't kill
this monster, Jim.

706
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,172
My last one got stuck in your throat,

707
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:46,908
so I'm thinking about
shoving this one somewhere else.

708
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,344
Jim, a little tip for next time:

709
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:53,114
always bring the right tools
for the job.

710
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:56,985
See you in hell, Theo.

711
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,123
Oh.

712
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:03,324
(click)

713
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,634
You're welcome.

714
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:26,722
Let's go, Butch.

715
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:29,851
Good night, fellas.

716
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,199
(grunting)

717
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:49,190
(laughs)

718
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,213
(grunting)

719
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:53,925
Oh, my God...

720
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,396
(laughs)

721
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,097
That little sprite was right.

722
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,034
GUARD: Freeze.

723
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:07,640
Remain where you are.

724
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,675
Oh, dear.

725
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,289
(panting)

726
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,668
Oh...

727
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:54,083
Are you my human subject?

728
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:56,617
What?

729
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,586
Were you sent here to test me?

730
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,624
Bridget?

731
00:42:02,657 --> 00:42:03,691
Who's Bridget?

732
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,829
It's me, Selina.

733
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,364
- What?
- You burnt yourself when the cops

734
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:10,665
tried to bust you, remember?

735
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,568
I don't remember anything before this.

736
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,167
Professor Strange told me I had amnesia.

737
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,739
No, don't trust him.

738
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:19,440
Your name's Bridget.

739
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:22,135
He told me he'd send people to test me.

740
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,514
Well, I'm not here to test you.
I'm here to take you home.

741
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:27,516
That's what he said you'd say.

742
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:28,784
Bridget, no, Bridget, no,

743
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,351
Bridget, no, Bridget, no, Bridget, no!

744
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,655
(doors locking)

745
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:36,124
Bridget, no.

746
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:38,107
Don't call me that.

747
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:40,021
My name's...

748
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:41,782
Firefly.

749
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:43,811
(sizzling)

750
00:42:45,038 --> 00:42:50,586
