1
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,147
Careful. You already lost one.

2
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,819
Good.

3
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,114
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,077
How's it coming?

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,996
This is fucking cool.

6
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,123
What did I tell you, motherfucker?

7
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,502
Stop fucking around.

8
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,671
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,632
- Yes, it's all good.
- Let's go.

10
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,303
Fucking idiot.

11
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,184
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

12
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,145
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

13
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,443
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

14
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,154
How much fucking money
do you want to make?

15
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,947
A fucking lot.

16
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,083
Mrs Salazar?

17
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,505
Mrs Salazar, housekeeping.

18
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

19
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:42,283
If you want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.

20
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,244
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

21
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:49,206
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

22
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,879
My organisation has four partners,
but only one leader.

23
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
I wanted to meet with you

24
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,928
to make sure there are no
misunderstandings in the North Valley

25
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,891
regarding the restructuring,
and the necessary house cleaning.

26
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:14,523
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

27
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
I will be honest with you.

28
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,404
Salazar never contributed a thing.
He never gave anyone work.

29
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,743
He made more noise than money.
Better said, too much noise.

30
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,209
We're moving forward with the plan,

31
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,339
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

32
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,384
Your message about the surrender
was very clear,

33
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,888
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

34
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,058
Have a safe trip home.

35
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,853
Henao, thank you for your friendship.

36
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,731
Excuse me.

37
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,193
Pacho.

38
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:09,411
Pacho, let's take advantage
of this window to maximise our profits.

39
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,664
I'd like to double our output
through Mexico.

40
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,586
Why don't you go there?
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

41
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,464
Make one last deal.

42
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:26,095
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

43
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,764
Pacho.

44
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,892
Look, Pacho...

45
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:38,941
I think it would be best if you left Cali
for a bit, while things cool off.

46
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:46,240
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

47
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,922
WHAT IS THE DEA DOING IN CALI?

48
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,187
Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Look.

49
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,690
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

50
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,987
Dad, where are we
with the government?

51
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,035
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

52
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,329
until they're cleared through surrender.

53
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,914
I know, but eventually they will be.

54
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,837
And that's all you can tell me?

55
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,425
You know the rule.

56
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,510
You can't be a part of this.

57
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,263
I didn't send you to law school
for you to worry about our surrender.

58
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,556
That's already planned.

59
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,560
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

60
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,897
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

61
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,652
You're reading it again?

62
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,447
You should read it once in a while.
Wise words.

63
00:10:55,572 --> 00:11:00,118
Sir, sorry to interrupt. You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

64
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,295
Hello?

65
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,093
<i>Four people, including three children,
are dead and thousands more injured</i>

66
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,805
<i>in a mysterious gas leak
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.</i>

67
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,140
<i>Investigators are at the scene
of the incident,</i>

68
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,852
<i>but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.</i>

69
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>State officials told residents
there will be a formal investigation.</i>

70
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,830
Silvio, can I bum a smoke?

71
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,839
Isn't it dangerous?

72
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,800
No more than it ever was.

73
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:01,972
If it was a natural gas leak,
I want to know before lighting up.

74
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,851
Unless it's not.

75
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,646
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

76
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,190
He doesn't have the balls
to talk to me.

77
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,112
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.

78
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,905
Off the record.

79
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,325
I don't know, Carolina.

80
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,788
Why don't you talk to him?
He's the district safety inspector.

81
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,292
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

82
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,298
- Silvio!
- Excuse me.

83
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,720
Careful picking it up. Lift it up.
Careful. Grab the other side.

84
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,727
That's good. A little bit more.

85
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,566
If they connect us to this,
our friend doubts

86
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,693
the government will honour our deal.

87
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:01,531
We'll be seen as no different from
Escobar, killing women and children.

88
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,494
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

89
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,205
Just like the poison
you monkeys dumped.

90
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,001
There's a reporter
asking questions in Yumbo

91
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,295
and a safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

92
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,341
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

93
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,135
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

94
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,679
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

95
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,183
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

96
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,686
Take care of it. Discreetly.

97
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,023
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

98
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,318
What?
You have another bright idea?

99
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,831
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

100
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,709
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

101
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,840
Let go. Turn. Run!

102
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,385
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

103
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,095
You see?

104
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,516
This is the bedroom.

105
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,019
No, sorry, Dad.
No, this is the living room.

106
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,771
The living room.

107
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,606
It's big, Jorge.

108
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,235
And the pool will go here.

109
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,195
And there, the kitchen.

110
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:29,286
And look. Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

111
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,996
A jacuzzi?

112
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:40,046
I always thought your brother
would have the house on the hill.

113
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

114
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,931
What was the last one?

115
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,474
Bio-diesel.

116
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,728
Bio-diesel.

117
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,064
Vegetable gas?

118
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,817
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

119
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,444
Well...

120
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,864
Very good.

121
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,618
Better late than never.

122
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,829
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

123
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,707
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

124
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,959
Yes, I'm coming.
Paola...

125
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,464
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

126
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,675
- It's all very nice.
- Affirmative, General.

127
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,102
You impressed him.

128
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,439
I don't care what he thinks.

129
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,443
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

130
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,030
It was always temporary.

131
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,908
Temporary? Right.

132
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,412
You know this lot is bigger
than we need.

133
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,665
Yes, but it's the one we want.

134
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,585
It's the one you deserve.

135
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,590
Six more months.

136
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,301
OK?

137
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,845
I promise.

138
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,691
Go.
I'll go with your parents.

139
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,818
I'm sorry, honey.

140
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,525
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

141
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,735
<i>Chepe!</i>

142
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,280
- How's everything going, brother?
<i>- All right.</i>

143
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:14,325
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

144
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,328
Good. Keep me posted.

145
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>You should be happy, Gilberto.</i>

146
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,834
<i>Chepe, do me a favour.</i>

147
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

148
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,634
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

149
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,597
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

150
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,099
<i>Why? Is everything all right?
You sound weird.</i>

151
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,686
I'm dealing with a problem
that's stressing me out.

152
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,229
It's our fault.

153
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,858
- Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.
<i>- Is it bad?</i>

154
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,485
I hope not.

155
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,237
<i>But it could complicate our surrender.</i>

156
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,908
OK, I'll be careful.

157
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,411
So good you're coming back, brother.

158
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,539
You'll leave behind
the hustle and shit of that city.

159
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,333
<i>It's not so bad.</i>

160
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,419
I love the trees in autumn.

161
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,131
The park looks gorgeous.

162
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,884
<i>I love you, brother. Talk soon.</i>

163
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,177
OK.

164
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,314
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

165
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,525
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

166
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,194
- María.
- Luisa.

167
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,030
What's happening?
Claudio hasn't returned?

168
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,116
No. And Diego?

169
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,078
Diego dragged his drunk ass home
at six in the morning.

170
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,289
- Bye.
- Bye.

171
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,002
I got your message.
What's going on?

172
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,921
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

173
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,715
He won't accept the money?

174
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,260
He has three crucifixes
in his office. Three.

175
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,763
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

176
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,395
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

177
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,272
Do you really want to know?

178
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:00,403
About a year ago, Don Miguel
and Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

179
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,326
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

180
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,998
They don't check it at Customs,
because it's a poisonous gas.

181
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,463
So that's why David spilled
the gas in Yumbo?

182
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,012
We should let him clean up
his own mess.

183
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,432
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

184
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:35,229
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say, we're all fucked.

185
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,190
You think they're going
to honour the pact?

186
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,192
You think there's really
going to be a surrender

187
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,279
between the cartel and the government
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

188
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,156
Never.

189
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,620
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

190
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:55,583
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

191
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,170
bank accounts,
income tax, properties.

192
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,174
And the only thing we're sure about?

193
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,343
This motherfucker is clean.

194
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,851
There's no one clean
in this world, Córdova. No one.

195
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,523
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

196
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,235
Gentlemen!

197
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,239
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

198
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:33,246
<i>We have to watch his wife, his kids,
even his fucking dog.</i>

199
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,333
We need to watch his house,
from the inside and out,

200
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,711
every single corner, 24/7.

201
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,051
I want to know what he does at work,
who he meets and where.

202
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,470
<i>I want to know his agenda.</i>

203
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,308
Whatever he does,
we're going to find out.

204
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:58,521
<i>We will be in charge
of his fucking life!</i>

205
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,066
And of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

206
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,570
At home, at the office, and his mobile.

207
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,530
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

208
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,371
Come to my house this Saturday
after football.

209
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,498
My dad gave me permission.

210
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,335
<i>- Awesome, I'll see you there.
- Cool, bye.</i>

211
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,464
<i>End of call.</i>

212
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,347
<i>Recording number two. 2:16pm.</i>

213
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:39,896
Yes. The company is registered under
one of the Rodríguez's fake companies.

214
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,941
<i>Recording number three. 4:32pm.</i>

215
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,740
I want to suck your dick.
Tomorrow. At the same place.

216
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,251
<i>Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you.</i>

217
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,213
It's María. Is Claudio there?

218
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,550
No. Isn't he with you?

219
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,471
No. He didn't come home last night.
I'm worried.

220
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,350
You're fighting again.

221
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,186
<i>You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.</i>

222
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,729
Nobody's seen him.

223
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,234
No one's seen him?

224
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,861
What did you do, María?

225
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,738
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

226
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,867
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

227
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,213
Mrs Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

228
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,993
Hello, sir.

229
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,204
They're always in room 105.

230
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,956
Very good. Thank you.

231
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,091
What a woman.

232
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:01,555
- This was well done.
- Thank you, sir.

233
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,226
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

234
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,400
Someone needs to talk to him.
Finish the job.

235
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,112
Don Gilberto, he knows me.
They won't let me in.

236
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,156
Jorge.

237
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,785
Jorge, you should handle it.

238
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,288
You've done such great work.
Great work so far.

239
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,917
And no one knows who he is.

240
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,299
I appreciate that.
But I only gather information.

241
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,513
Sir, the truth is,
I'm a man of few words.

242
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,062
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

243
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
to determine their future.

244
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:58,904
Like the success of one operation
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

245
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:06,871
This is the final stretch.
We all have to do our part. Understood?

246
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,205
Yes, sir.

247
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,570
Was there a problem
with your last order?

248
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,322
No. No problems.

249
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,700
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

250
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:51,707
300 barrels? Mr Crespo,
that's nearly double. I can't do it.

251
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,584
How come?

252
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:58,172
There's a new buyer and their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

253
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,217
We're already stretched very thin.

254
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,470
I've been your most important client
for years.

255
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:08,057
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

256
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:11,435
- However, this other organisation...
- Isn't.

257
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,978
I'm sorry.

258
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,273
So who are they?

259
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,735
They're kids.

260
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,989
Dominicans.

261
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,159
Running out of some beauty parlour
in Queens.

262
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,745
I see.

263
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,957
They'll probably end up
dead or locked up.

264
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,628
You know, it's a young man's world.

265
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,006
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

266
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:47,638
This beauty parlour in Queens,
give me the address.

267
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,642
But...

268
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,342
Thanks for the cigarette.

269
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,559
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

270
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,146
You can see here
that the product loss was very little.

271
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,690
And the bribes?

272
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,154
Well, the payoffs...
they went up this week.

273
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,951
Went up this week to six million, sir.

274
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,288
- Guillermo...
- Yes, sir?

275
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:25,337
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

276
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,219
No more friends.

277
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,473
This is everything, right?

278
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,685
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

279
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,313
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

280
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,358
the senators, congressmen,
all the cops.

281
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,529
- I want an exact copy of this book.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,575
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

283
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,078
You think someone would dare
to do something to you?

284
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,791
Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

285
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,215
Any news about Salazar's wife?

286
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,385
Yes, Don Miguel.

287
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,514
The bitch has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

288
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,561
You want me to handle it?

289
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>I understand you have information
on the Yumbo incident.</i>

290
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,316
- Yes, I do.
- Good. Tell me.

291
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,178
Your wife at the Palace Motel
at 3:45pm.

292
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,015
After she dropped the kids off
at football practice.

293
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,398
So?

294
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,570
At your press conference
this afternoon,

295
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:59,616
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

296
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,912
We have audio and video as well.

297
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,499
Look, you bought-off monkey,

298
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,794
take these pictures and go fuck yourself.

299
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,214
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

300
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,259
so that the world will know
what you people do.

301
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,262
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

302
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:24,141
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

303
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,773
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

304
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,985
However, you're not understanding me.

305
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,740
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

306
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,659
They care what your children
might think,

307
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,163
what their classmates might think.

308
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,041
And your distinguished family.

309
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,212
Think of what they would say
at your church.

310
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:56,965
If you don't do what I tell you,

311
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,887
the men I work for will make sure

312
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:06,266
that the whole world will have
a copy of this tape.

313
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,982
Thank you.

314
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,155
Mrs Salazar...

315
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,907
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

316
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,159
I've never heard of it.

317
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,288
Relaxation treatment?

318
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,707
That sounds nice.

319
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,377
You have a funny accent.

320
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,005
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

321
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,050
- Colombian.
- This guy's Colombian, too.

322
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,929
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

323
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,864
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

324
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,201
What a small world, right?

325
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,958
All right, what do you want?

326
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,546
I want you to go through that door.

327
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,632
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

328
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,511
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

329
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:11,933
is getting a relaxation treatment
and would like to speak with them.

330
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,062
Go.

331
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,943
You stay.

332
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,288
Cool.

333
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,864
- Please, take a seat.
- It's better if I stand.

334
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,120
- A drink?
- No. Thank you.

335
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,333
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

336
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,214
I understand you have a question.

337
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,259
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

338
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,345
- And you think I know the truth?
- Yes.

339
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,474
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

340
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:20,770
- And if I don't tell you?
- Then I was wrong. And you are a coward.

341
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:33,492
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

342
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,203
For a personal injury he caused.

343
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:11,214
This market, we made it ourselves.
It's ours.

344
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,174
We can't just give it up to you.

345
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:18,930
- You haven't heard my proposal yet.
- Say what you got to say.

346
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:24,436
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

347
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,396
and never come back.

348
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,191
Oh, yeah?
And the second? What?

349
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,776
Second...

350
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:37,032
There is no second.
Just the first thing.

351
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:44,039
- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen...

352
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:50,420
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

353
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:55,008
Recently, I've had to accept
some things that I don't like.

354
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,429
I advise you to do the same.

355
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:07,979
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

356
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,691
- Ten.
- Nine.

357
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:14,944
- Nine.
- Eight.

358
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,448
You think this is funny,
motherfucker?

359
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,368
Seven.

360
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,997
- Seven.
- Six.

361
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,670
- Six.
- Five.

362
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,588
- Four.
- Four.

363
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,798
Three, two, one.

364
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,969
- Check on him.
- Got it.

365
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:37,110
"So then the crow flew up
as high as he could,

366
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:41,781
"losing sight of the dogs,
and returned to the flock.

367
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,492
"The crow went to find
his friend the cat,

368
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,163
"whom he had saved from danger,

369
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:52,751
"and lived with him
in peace and happiness."

370
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,463
And that's where we'll leave off
because it's time for bed.

371
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:00,008
You too.

372
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,344
Very good.

373
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,308
- Did the girls go to sleep?
- Yes.

374
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,809
How's the book?

375
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,645
I think they understand it
better than I do.

376
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,815
<i>The municipal safety inspector
closed his investigation</i>

377
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,067
<i>into the tragedy in Yumbo today.</i>

378
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:24,783
<i>Hundreds were injured in a leak,
some are still in critical condition.</i>

379
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:29,287
<i>Four died, including three children.</i>

380
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:34,000
<i>The deceased were two seven-year-old
boys and a six-year-old girl.</i>

381
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,253
- Can you believe this horrible news?
<i>- One of the boys was about to celebrate</i>

382
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:41,299
<i>his first communion
at the Santa María church.</i>

383
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:44,385
<i>- Now, instead of celebration...
- Fuck. This is terrible!</i>

384
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:47,305
<i>- ...there will be tears at their funerals.</i>
- It's terrible.

385
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,058
I can't find my binoculars.

386
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:53,228
- Dad, let's go, we'll miss the game.
- Sir.

387
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:57,482
Flaco. You're my fourth wife, buddy.

388
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,150
I love you, man.

389
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,402
Sir, they want to make
an announcement at tonight's game,

390
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:04,155
in honour of the victims
of the Yumbo tragedy.

391
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,657
Good idea.

392
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:09,828
And tell them to say we'll donate
half the ticket sales to the victims.

393
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,538
- You got it.
- Now, let's see if we win.

394
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,456
If we get to the game on time.

395
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,961
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll keep this brief.</i>

396
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:23,758
<i>After a thorough investigation,
we've reached the conclusion</i>

397
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:27,929
<i>that the Yumbo chemical exposure</i>

398
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:33,268
<i>was caused by a faulty valve
in a natural gas line in the area.</i>

399
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,063
<i>And because of that, from now on,</i>

400
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:43,736
<i>the gas company will be responsible
for the expenses. Now...</i>
