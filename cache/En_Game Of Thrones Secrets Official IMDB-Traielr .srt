00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:05,571
Do you know what they did to my brother , and my mother ?

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:12,269
I lie awake all night , thinking about how they died

4
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:21,419
What good is power , if you can not protect the ones you love ?

5
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,847
We can avenge them

6
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,435
Well that time I was gone

7
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,149
The world's fallen apart

8
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:32,146
Always keep your foes confused

9
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,845
If they don't know who you are or what you want

10
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,416
They can't know what you plan to do next

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,723
Some times it is better to answer injustice with mercy

12
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:50,535
I will answer injustice with justice

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,053
This Spring

14
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,085
 running out of time

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,458
I will not become a page in someone else's history book

16
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,032
The New Season

17
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:02,542
If fat boy's still walking , it's cause you let him go

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,018
Begins

19
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,076
You're a Targaryen

20
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,672
 you're the mother of dragons

21
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,357
i need to be more than that

22
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:11,476
Who can we trust ?

23
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:13,786
Ourselves alone

24
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:17,235
We must not disappoint father

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,094
You've done nothing wrong

26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,483
I've done plenty wrong

27
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:29,721
