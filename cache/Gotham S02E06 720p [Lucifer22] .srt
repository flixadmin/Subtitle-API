1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,298
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham:

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,770
How I ever let him
lay a hand on me...

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,271
(grunting)

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,376
I'm glad he's out
of your life.

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,510
ALFRED:
Keep that guard up--
jab, jab.

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,845
Lead... jab, jab, right.

7
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,080
What you doing?
Alfred's teaching
me to fight.

8
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,482
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

9
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,950
The firebugs from the Narrows?

10
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,551
<i>I used to hang</i>
<i>with their sister, Bridgit.</i>

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,553
GILZEAN:
Hey, boys.
We need the best

12
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,022
and you guys are the best.

13
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,524
JOE:
<i>Bridgy, you just got</i>
<i>a promotion.</i>

14
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,595
GCPD!

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,929
Run!

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,402
I got her! Drop it!
Drop it!
(Bridgit screams)

17
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,604
(Garrett screaming)

18
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,305
THEO:
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

19
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,374
OSWALD:
Mother.

20
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,609
GERTRUD:
I don't know nothing.

21
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,244
You are going to go to Galavan.

22
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,578
Once you're inside
his organization,

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,080
you will find my mother
and rescue her.

24
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,048
He'll buy it

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,315
if we sell it right.

26
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,352
(screams)

27
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:58,791
...and then Penguin
just went crazy.

28
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,927
I mean, like... crazier
than I've ever seen him.

29
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,965
He said it was me that set up
the count house raid,

30
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,134
said I was a traitor and a rat.

31
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,302
(rope creaking)

32
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:14,640
Then he...
he came at me with a cleaver.

33
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,443
I tried to protect myself
and he did this.

34
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,611
(low grunting)
Sick bastard.

35
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,181
Hmm.

36
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,382
How'd you get away?

37
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:24,683
GILZEAN:
There was a lot of blood.

38
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,585
A lot.

39
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,487
And he... he tried
to take another swing

40
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,323
and he slipped and fell
and so I just ran.

41
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,159
I ran and I ran and then...

42
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,162
the next thing I knew,
I woke up in the hospital.

43
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,431
Huh.

44
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,203
Give me a shot, Mr. Galavan.

45
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,471
Let me show you what I can do.

46
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,773
Well, I'd like
to help you out,

47
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,074
Butch,

48
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,609
but I already have several

49
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,811
capable, two-handed thugs

50
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,679
in my employ.

51
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,115
They don't know Gotham
like I do.

52
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,083
I got brains, you ask anyone.

53
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,086
What do you think, ladies?

54
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,521
I think he's cute.

55
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,756
Like a sad bear.

56
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,461
I suppose
he's telling the truth.

57
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,532
The little man was cracking up
last time I saw him.

58
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,901
He was very mean
to me once.

59
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,836
Held me hostage in
my own apartment.

60
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,005
Said some
nasty things.

61
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,407
Isn't that right, stumpy?

62
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,042
That's right, ma'am.

63
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,612
And I'm sorry for it.

64
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,680
Business is business,
you know?

65
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,315
Please.

66
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,450
Let me work for you,

67
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,519
Mr. Galavan.

68
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:36,889
I got nobody else to turn to.

69
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,657
(gasps)
Oh, yes!

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,493
We can put cool things
on his stump,

71
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,061
like knives

72
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,930
and mallets and stuff.

73
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,064
Ooh!

74
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,134
How about a little
tiny chain saw?

75
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,736
Yes.

76
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,037
Huh.

77
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,673
Well, that settles it.

78
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,141
Welcome aboard, Butch.

79
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,876
Thank you, sir.

80
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,312
(cries out)
THEO:
Oh!

81
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,680
(laughs) Oh.

82
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,549
Bravo, Congressman.

83
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,117
Well saved.

84
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,418
You really are

85
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,354
quite spry
for a big man.

86
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,823
Have you reconsidered
your position?

87
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,526
Can I count on your
support this election?
Yes.

88
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,596
Yes, you have my full support.

89
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,131
Thank you so much.

90
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,504
(grunting, panting)

91
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,693
(panting)

92
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,198
(grunting)

93
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,170
Freeze!

94
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,909
Man, I didn't do nothing!
Why you chasing me?

95
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,577
A police officer
died last night,

96
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,813
killed by a firebug crew
on a spree.

97
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,514
You're a firebug, aren't you?

98
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,451
No, man! I been out
of the game a long time!

99
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,820
(grunts)

100
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,588
Don't lie to me, Nino!
I swear!

101
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,457
Sir, that's a violation
of officer conduct regs.

102
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,026
Luke Garrett burned to death
in front of me 12 hours ago.

103
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,095
I'll conduct myself
as I see fit.

104
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,831
This crew's working
with a kid.

105
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,932
A girl.

106
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,734
Wears a homemade fire suit.

107
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,370
Hey, for real! Never heard of
a female firebug before.

108
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,537
It's mad rare,

109
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,506
like a... like a unicorn
or something.

110
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,576
(grunts)

111
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,247
(Nino groaning)

112
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,419
Sir?

113
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,856
Captain Barnes says we must
report any infractions.

114
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,492
Even by superior officers.

115
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,761
You do that.

116
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,104
What are you doing?

117
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,474
Can't sleep.

118
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,143
I don't know what
to do with myself.

119
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,711
(sighs loudly)

120
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,146
That's the point

121
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,947
of being free.

122
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,517
You get to do
whatever the hell you want.

123
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,951
What am I gonna do?

124
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,521
I killed someone last night.

125
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,522
I can't go home.

126
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,023
I can't go
to the police...

127
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,059
You gotta get out of town.
How?

128
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,760
I got no money.

129
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,565
No problem.

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,134
We'll get some.

131
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,437
You mean, like, crime?

132
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,571
(laughs)

133
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,039
Man, you<i> are</i> square.

134
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,509
(sighs)

135
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,778
I guess I got no choice.

136
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,882
Why are you helping me?

137
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,785
Maybe you remind me of me.

138
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,088
If I was a doofus.

139
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,122
(laughs)

140
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,692
This crime...

141
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,295
what exactly you got in mind?

142
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,901
♪ I'll fight for... ♪

143
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,037
AUCTIONEER:
Ladies and gentlemen!

144
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,905
Or should I say,
pimps, hoes and thieves!

145
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,141
Do I have some product
for you today!

I want her!

Bidding will start at $800.
Apiece.

153

Have we got $800? Come on!

156
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,265
Those girls
are for sale?

157
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,835
Told you this place
was freaky.

158
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,872
We need to help them.

159
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,508
We're here to help you.

But...
Listen!

163
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,047
Listen.

164
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,120
You go down the stairs.

165
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,390
The lock on the back door
is busted.

166
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,592
I know, 'cause I busted it.

167
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,593
You go in,

168
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,462
wait for me
to make my move.

169
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,596
How will I know when?

170
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,199
Pay attention.

171
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,544
Sold for $2,500 to the gentleman
in the burgundy hat!

172
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,413
Come on, ladies.

173
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,916
Found you a nice new home!

174
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,418
Oh, you'll be very satisfied.
Very, very satisfied.

175
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,352
Next up!

176
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,788
Check her out as she walks
down the stage;

177
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,557
see how graceful she is.

178
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,958
Look at this one! Whoo!

179
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,527
I'm going to start the bidding
here at $900!

180
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,362
Can I get $900?!
(grunts)

181
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,800
SELINA:
Hey, pervs!

182
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,303
This is a robbery!

183
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,238
Milo! Kill that punk.

184
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,180
She's with me.

185
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:06,151
Now, each of you
put all your cash in the bag.

186
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,152
Or what?

187
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,354
I ain't
scared of you.

188
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,230
Yeah.

189
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,065
All right.

190
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,867
Anybody else got a problem?

191
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,368
Yeah, didn't think so.

192
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,903
(women shouting)

193
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,675
And for the record?

194
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,744
All y'all suck.

195
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,082
Help!

196
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,291
Come on, come on!
Get me out of here!

197
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,467
MAN:
Hey, stop!

198
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,037
(screams)

199
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,975
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

200
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,545
I know, right?
Let's go.

201
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,119
A note in my file?
Are you serious?

202
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,922
Do I look like I'm joking?

203
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,458
We do not beat suspects!<i> Ever!</i>

204
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,929
(garbled radio transmission)

205
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,798
I get it.

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,099
Luke was a good kid.

207
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,402
We took him out of the academy,
told him he was ready.

208
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,939
Now he's dead.
You lose people in war.
You know that.

209
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,741
Make no mistake,
this is war.

210
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,011
But that doesn't give you or me
the license to break the law.

211
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,780
There's a line.

212
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,349
I learned that the hard way.

213
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,587
Respectfully, sir,
this is Gotham.

214
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,255
There are gray areas.

215
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,658
I've learned that
the hard way, too.

216
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,193
And did you
even get a lead

217
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,929
while you were
out avenging Luke?

218
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,564
No, sir.
No, sir?

219
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,933
Well, you got one now.

220
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,071
Bodega owner called this in.

221
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,906
His security camera
caught it.

222
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,240
She's our firefly.

223
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,509
We don't know who
the other one is.

224
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,315
(squealing)

225
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,753
I do.

226
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,055
Damn it.

227
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,364
(Bruce grunting)

228
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,166
Focus. Focus!

229
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,402
Head down!
Head down!

230
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,338
Distractions will be the
death of you, Master Bruce.

231
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,274
Now, get on your toes.
On your toes.

232
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,509
Move!

233
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,344
Well, don't...

234
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,513
dance around like
a bloody showgirl.

235
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,015
Come on.
(grunts)

236
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,916
That's better. Better.

237
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,819
Now, big left,
big left. Go on!

238
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,422
I got you. Now, your enemies
Hey.

239
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,759
are gonna fight a lot dirtier
than that.

240
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,061
Ow. Ow!

241
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,730
(panting)
Bloody
hell.

242
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,965
(chuckles)

243
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,435
Very good, Master Bruce.

244
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,770
Eh?

245
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,439
Have you spoken to Mr. Fox
about the computer?

246
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,907
That I have, yeah.

247
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,375
How much longer
until it's fixed? (grunts)

248
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,445
I'll tell you when it's done,
won't I? Patience.

249
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,181
I'm tired of patience, Alfred.
I'm ready to begin.

250
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,650
I'll tell you when you're ready,
Master Bruce.

251
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,152
I'm ready now. I know I am.

252
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,454
(grunting)
Oh, by the way,
by the way,

253
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,222
Miss Silver called.
She wants you to go

254
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,391
for dinner this evening.

255
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,394
Silver called?

256
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,295
Yeah.

257
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,630
(shouts)

258
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,068
Told ya.

259
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,336
Not ready.

260
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,277
Let's go.

261
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,280
KRINGLE:
Well, he just up
and moved out of town.

262
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,482
It was rude
and inconsiderate

263
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,185
and perfectly in character
for Tom Dougherty.

264
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,519
Do you ever wonder
where he went?

265
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,189
He could be dead in a ditch
for all I care.

266
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:08,093
Kristen.
And I mean it, too.
He, um...

267
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,061
he wasn't very nice to me.

268
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,896
That's awful.

269
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,265
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

270
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,268
But... it all worked out
for the best.

271
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,904
THOMPKINS:
I know. You and Ed
seem to be getting along.

272
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,106
(Kringle
chuckles)

273
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,909
He is so gentle and kind.

274
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,245
Almost too gentle.

275
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,248
I-I think a man needs
to have a little...

276
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,318
a little fire, a little danger
in him, don't you think?

277
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,420
Oh, I don't know about that.
(chuckles)

278
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,023
And sometimes I-I feel like

279
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,925
he's holding something back
from me.

280
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,527
THOMPKINS:
Like a secret?

281
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,995
I don't know.

282
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,166
I just... I guess I just wish
he would open up a little more.

283
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,238
Good morning.

284
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,006
Miss Kringle,
Miss Thompkins.

285
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,508
Hi.

286
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,343
What do you call
a three-legged cow?

287
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,079
I am terrible...
Lean beef.

288
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,415
Or supper. At my place.

289
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,287
Oh... Ed.

290
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,125
Aw.

291
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,460
(both chuckle)

292
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,097
Ginger to ginger,
we both know

293
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,632
you know
where Selina Kyle's at,

294
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,569
so why don't you tell me now
and save us the hassle.

295
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,738
Who's Selina Kyle?

296
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,705
Cat.

297
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:28,840
Cat?

298
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,475
Look, Ivy,

299
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,043
want me to call
the children's home

300
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,511
and have 'em come get you now?

301
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,646
Or should I get

302
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,449
a candy bar and forget
to have someone watch you?

303
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,553
Candy bar.

304
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,754
I struck out.

305
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,723
None of the street kids
I talked to have seen Selina.

306
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,592
Relax. Your Uncle
Harvey has you covered.

307
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,928
She's in a squat off
Jenkins. Condemned SRO.

308
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,130
I know it.

309
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,765
Hey. Last time

310
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,634
we saw this chick, she had
a shotgun pointed at us.

311
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,837
Maybe you should take
the Fascist Youth, huh?

312
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,104
Nah.

313
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,374
With Selina,
it's best to go quietly.

314
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,380
When you get
to the bus station,

315
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,217
take the first bus
south.

316
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,819
Stay on till the end
of the line.

317
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,955
Well, what do I do then?

318
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,090
You got plenty of money.
You can do what you like.

319
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,259
Thank you.

320
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,460
For everything.

321
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,063
You've been
a really good friend.

322
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,497
I got my cut.

323
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,867
(chuckles)
No biggie.

324
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,636
(vehicle approaching)

325
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,772
(tires screeching)

326
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,076
Bridgit, you need to run.

327
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,078
Bridgit, run!
Run! Run!
No...

328
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,513
Selina! No!

329
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,115
Selina!

330
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,149
No! No!

331
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,818
(Bridgit shouting)

332
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,121
(grunting)

333
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,156
BRIDGIT:
Help me!

334
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,459
(Bridgit shouting indistinctly)

335
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,393
Hey!

336
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,166
(panting)

337
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,193
Hands in the air!

338
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,103
Drop the gun.
Like hell I will.

339
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,705
Where's your
girlfriend?

340
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,673
Who?

341
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,374
We got both of you on tape.

342
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,177
Don't know what you're talking
about, Gordon.

343
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,013
She's burnt down
half a dozen buildings.

344
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,115
Killed a cop.
You're running

345
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,650
with a bad partner, kid.

346
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,451
You don't understand.

347
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,454
She was forced
to do all of that.

348
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,994
Okay.

349
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,365
Let me help her.

350
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,367
Who is she?
Who's forcing her

351
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,269
to do this?

352
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,209
Look, there's a lot
of angry cops out there.

353
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,612
She's gonna get shot on sight,
unless I get to her first.

354
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,021
Her name is Bridgit Pike.

355
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,889
Her brothers took her back.

356
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,624
Joe and Cale Pike.

357
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,893
They, like... kidnapped her.

358
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,128
They're the ones

359
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,597
who made her start burning stuff
in the first place.

360
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,666
It's their fault the cop died.

361
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,301
The Pike brothers?

362
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,604
Why'd they burn down
Wayne Enterprises' buildings?

363
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,239
Who paid them?
Why the hell should I know

364
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,708
why the Pikes do anything?
They're freakin' nuts.

365
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,610
They treated Bridgit like a
slave, chained her to the wall.

366
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,213
And you're angry about it.
Is that why you're armed?

367
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,081
You're gonna go
after the Pikes?

368
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,583
Rescue your friend?

369
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,851
No.

370
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,152
That's a yes.

371
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,888
Look, you're gonna get
your friend and yourself killed.

372
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,623
Let me handle the Pikes.

373
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,859
No offense, Jim,

374
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,195
but I like my chances better
than yours.

375
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,731
Why get involved?

376
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,066
Why risk your neck?

377
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,534
Who is this
girl to you?

378
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,037
No one. Just...

379
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,973
a girl in the neighborhood.

380
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,677
I give you my word.

381
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,113
I will do everything I can
to keep her safe.

382
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,717
But you have to
stay out of it.

383
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,119
Tell me where she is.

384
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,656
(grunts)

385
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,925
Damn.

386
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,061
She's got six grand here.

387
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,263
Little Bridgy put
on her big girl pants.

388
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,065
You can take all of it.
I don't care.

389
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,332
Oh, I'm taking it.

390
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,368
That's not the issue.
The issue

391
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,172
is you thinking it's cool to
just ditch your brothers, hmm?

392
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,543
CALE:
Oh, snap.

393
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,577
Bridgit's gonna get it.

394
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,512
Joe, please.

395
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,049
Did you even think about us,
hmm?

396
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,284
Did you even think
how we would feel?

397
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,186
(bang)
No, don't!

398
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,153
Joe,

399
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,655
I didn't mean anything by it!

400
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,225
I'm a sensitive guy,
and you hurt my feelings.

401
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,327
(gasping)
(bang)

402
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,629
You know, without family,
what do you got?

403
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,864
You-you got

404
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,032
nothin', right?

405
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,767
You want to be part
of the family again?

406
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,137
(bang)
(gasps, panting)

407
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,042
I said...

408
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,645
do you feel like being part
of this family

409
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,781
again?

410
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,316
(Bridgit whimpers)

411
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,484
Yes!

412
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,719
(bangs)
(screams)
Damn! (laughs)

413
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,687
Damn, that hurts.

414
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,556
Bridgit's back.
(whimpering)

415
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,625
(chains rattling)

416
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:52,864
If you try anything like
that again, I'll kill you,

417
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:57,135
and I'll skin that little
cat bitch, too. You hear me?

418
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,737
You're never leaving.

419
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,905
Yes.

420
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,106
Good.

421
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,641
Go make our supper.

422
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,176
All right,

423
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,445
let's pack it up.

424
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,056
(Oswald sputters)

425
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,659
Dear me.

426
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,827
A mallet.

427
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,930
That's, um... useful.

428
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,432
Don't even start.

429
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,935
Tell me you bring good news.

430
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,703
I'm in.

431
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,804
I'm in good.

432
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,806
And? And?!

433
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,775
I'm asking questions.

434
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,177
But it's dangerous.

435
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,013
If I push too hard,
Galavan'll be onto me.

436
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,282
I told you,
he's a smart guy.

437
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,685
Look at me, Butch.

438
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,422
Are you my servant?

439
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,557
(sniffs)

440
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,091
Yes.

441
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,961
Do you obey me in all things?

442
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,329
Yes.

443
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,933
Then why do you
bring me excuses?

444
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,602
Go find my mother.

445
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:08,039
Before I chop off
your other hand.

446
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,309
(slurping)
Yes, boss.

447
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,148
Come on.
Harder.

448
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,849
(laughs)

449
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,253
(gasping,
laughing)

450
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,155
Come on, Joe.

451
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,662
What are you gonna do,

452
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,130
kill us?

453
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,666
Yep.

454
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,573
(screaming)

455
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,744
Oh, God!
(screaming)
(screaming)

456
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,491
(sizzling)

457
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,227
I'll check
the other room.

458
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,599
(door opens)

459
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,736
(groans, sniffing)

460
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,504
Clear!
(groans)

461
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,706
She's not
here.

462
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,408
Damn.

463
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,444
I hate how it smells
like good barbecue.

464
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,179
(gasps)
(screams)

465
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,215
Bitch.

466
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,184
(grunting)

467
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,185
Bullock, hey!

468
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,220
What?!

469
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,289
Scared the hell
out of me!

470
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,592
(gasping, exhales)

471
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
And now he's dead.

472
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,766
Nice work, Bullock.
Oh, yeah.
My kicks did it?

473
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:45,136
Maybe it's because he's fried
like a taquito!

474
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,605
It's not on me.

475
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,574
Uh-huh.

476
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,877
Looks like Selina was telling
the truth.

477
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,580
Look, I don't want to speak ill
of the dead, but these asshats

478
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,216
had it coming.
These asshats were
professional arsonists.

479
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,185
Somebody hired them.

480
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,453
Why Wayne
Enterprises?

481
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,188
Who cares, all right?

482
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,756
There's a freaky
firefly chick

483
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,125
on the loose with
a flamethrower.

484
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,127
Let's start there.

485
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,663
(groans)

486
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,745
(whimpering)

487
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,814
Hallelujah.

488
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,187
Hello, Butch.

489
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,621
Sorry to keep you
waiting.

490
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,624
I just wanted
to check in,

491
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,727
see how things
were going.

492
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:43,961
Any complaints?

493
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,163
No. No, sir. I'm fine
like a bottle of wine.

494
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,400
(chuckles)
Good.

495
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,305
You have a real future here.

496
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,742
You are a hard worker,
and you're loyal to a fault.

497
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,377
Thank you, boss.

498
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,546
If only you were loyal to me.

499
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,316
I, uh...

500
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:06,650
I don't know
what you're talking about.

501
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,985
Come on, Butch.
Have some dignity.

502
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,121
I know what you were doing.

503
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,256
You were looking for
Penguin's mother, weren't you?

504
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,058
The hand was a nice touch.

505
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,793
Almost fooled me.

506
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:19,864
How on earth
did Penguin get you to do that?

507
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,199
I'm his servant.

508
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,468
I have to obey him
in all things.

509
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,438
Penguin's done a number
on you, huh?

510
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,174
Tinkered
with your wiring.

511
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,711
Perhaps we can help.

512
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,113
Tabby?

513
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,882
Tabby, could you come
here, please?

514
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,256
Penguin has brainwashed
this poor soul.

515
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,124
Can we help?

516
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,326
Be my pleasure.

517
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,529
All right, let-let's...

518
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:54,198
let's talk about this.
Can we talk about this?

519
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,266
Take it easy.

520
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,667
What are you doing?

521
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,202
Relax.

522
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,005
We just want to help.

523
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,910
(grunts)

524
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,645
(panting)

525
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,015
(shouts, pants)

526
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,750
(grunting)

527
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,153
(grunts, shouts)

528
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,456
THEO: I'll leave
you two to it.

529
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,892
Uh, remember,
dinner's in an hour.

530
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,829
(gasps, gags)

531
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,866
(Tabitha sighs)

532
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,438
We've set up a perimeter.

533
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,373
She can't have gotten far.
And we're sitting

534
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,875
on Selina Kyle's place.

535
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,510
Keep me posted.

536
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,117
Bridgit Pike
was abused her whole life,

537
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,520
forced to set
those fires.

538
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:53,023
I promised my informant
I would keep her safe.

539
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,092
Uh,

540
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,696
weren't you the one saying that
Luke Garrett was just a kid?

541
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,231
That we owe him justice?

542
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,566
I know that's what I said.

543
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,268
And you were right.

544
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,637
And now she
killed him.

545
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,806
Now she has
two more dead bodies on her.

546
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:12,109
So I don't care about the hows
and the whys and the boo-hoos.

547
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,045
You don't make promises
you can't keep.

548
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,148
You find her
and you take her down.

549
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,149
Clear?

550
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,418
Yes, sir.

551
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,896
(pigeons cooing)

552
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,411
We must've spent
years up here,

553
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,447
watching these birds.

554
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,851
Remember when Mickey Slattery
called us orphan bastards

555
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,587
and we tried to throw him
off the roof?

556
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,458
The cops are
outside my place.

557
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,127
You need to get
out of town.

558
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,228
I'm not scared of them.

559
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,730
Bridgit, I know what you did
to your brothers.

560
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,866
Not that they didn't
deserve it, but...

561
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,001
whoa.

562
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,703
I was surprised.

563
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:17,308
Cale flamed up good, but it was
Joe who burned the brightest.

564
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,643
You don't sound like yourself.

565
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,211
I'm not myself anymore.

566
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,546
I'm free.

567
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,316
Just like you told me I was.

568
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,684
So what are you gonna do?

569
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,153
I'm gonna go after
the rest of them.

570
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,154
The rest of who?

571
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,222
The pervs and the bullies.

572
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,858
The ones
who hurt people like us.

573
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,361
No one's ever
gone after me or hurt me.

574
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,030
Yeah, right.

575
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,833
Rule number one:

576
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,501
look after number one.

577
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,036
That's you.

578
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,240
Don't be crazy, or you'll
get yourself killed.

579
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,742
Don't worry about me, Selina.

580
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,510
This is what I was meant to do.

581
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,981
Bridgit, please,
don't do this.

582
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:00,184
It's nice to have someone
who cares about me.

583
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,919
Thank you.

584
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,721
I don't care.

585
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,457
I just think you're
being dumb. But...

586
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,258
hey...

587
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,794
good luck.

588
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,642
I'll see you around.

589
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,427
A toast.

590
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,196
TABITHA:
I'm so sorry.

591
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,233
Something came up last minute.

592
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,506
(clears throat)

593
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,175
As I was saying:

594
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,311
To family.

595
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,481
In the end,
it's all that matters.

596
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,286
Family.

597
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,291
I hope, in time,

598
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,061
you'll come to think
of us as family, Bruce.

599
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,064
Thank you.

600
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,067
It's-it's been some time
since I had a...

601
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,301
a meal like this.

602
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,103
You mean with girls?

603
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,472
You should come over more often.

604
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,241
We can, like,
hang out or whatever.

605
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,609
I'd like that.

606
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,479
Look how cute they are.

607
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,280
Don't you

608
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,481
just want to eat them?

609
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,284
Tabitha,
leave the young people alone.

610
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,852
Well, they are cute.

611
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,821
And they know it.

612
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,665
(Peggy Lee's "Sugar" playing)

613
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,599
KRINGLE:
These were

614
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,268
the best mashed potatoes
I have ever had.

615
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,070
I swear, I'm gonna get plump.

616
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,972
I like that you have
an appetite.

617
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,640
Stop it, you're spoiling me.

618
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,943
I won't stop it.
I want nothing more

619
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,044
than to spoil you.

620
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,713
Oh. Ed.

621
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,116
So forceful.

622
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,186
There's something else
I want to tell you.

623
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,188
I just...

624

I don't want to scare you away.

625

Please, tell me anything.

00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,778
UNIT ALPHA:
Yes, sir.

664
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,747
Freeze!

665
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:24,715
Hands in the air!

666
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,916
Hold your fire!

667
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,653
Bridgit Pike!

668
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,255
Stay away!

669
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,724
My name's Jim Gordon.

670
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:38,262
I know what
your brothers did to you.

671
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,663
(gasping)

672
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,932
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

673
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,867
You don't know anything!

674
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,370
You put your weapon
down and come with me,

675
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,705
I can help you.

676
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,407
There are places
you can go.

677
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,276
I'm not going to jail!

678
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,077
You're a juvenile.

679
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,280
We can work something out.

680
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,584
Wait, wait!

681
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,618
I said hold your fire!

682
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,860
Bridgit!

683
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,862
Stop!

684
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:13,563
Take cover!

685
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:25,809
Bridgit!

686
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:26,643
Wait!

687
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,987
(screaming)

688
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,705
I'm glad we have a moment
alone. There is something

689
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,040
I need to discuss.

690
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,842
Oh.

691
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:01,445
An executive at
Wayne Enterprises

692
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,447
has been
reported missing:

693
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,049
Sid Bunderslaw.

694
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,118
Do you know him?

695
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,253
Yes.

696
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,023
We've met several times.

697
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,458
What happened?

698
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,826
No one knows.

699
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,427
But it doesn't
look good.

700
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,462
How did you hear?

701
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,731
Let's just say I have
friends in high places,

702
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,366
and I've been following
the goings-on

703
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,768
at Wayne Enterprises
<i>very</i> closely.

704
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,737
What have you learned?

705
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,772
That your father
was a good man.

706
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,774
A great man, even.

707
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,843
But in spite of that,

708
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,679
bad things happened
at his company.

709
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,352
Unfortunately,
I think you're right.

710
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,155
I can tell you're very
mature for your age.

711
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:49,292
Ready to tackle the problems
of your company head-on.

712
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,628
But you'll need help.

713
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,296
Once I'm mayor,

714
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,333
I would very much
like to be that person.

715
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,471
Thank you...

716
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,407
Mr. Galavan.

717
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,242
I-I appreciate it.

718
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,178
(clicks tongue)

719
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,921
Butch.

720
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,956
What has happened?
I found your mother.

721
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,359
Where?
In a warehouse

722
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,960
down by the port.

723
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,328
But they caught me looking.

724
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,597
You half-wit!
If they kill my mother...!

725
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,999
Look, they don't know I'm here.

726
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,068
The tigerlady, she wanted
to take her time with me,

727
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,637
so she chained me up
and I got out.

728
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,772
We gotta go now.

729
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,240
(laughing)

730
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,310
Yes. Yes, yes.

731
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,478
Good, Butch.

732
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,713
You've done well.

733
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,349
Your loyalty
will be rewarded handsomely.

734
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,751
I swear it.

735
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,386
Yes, boss.

736
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,987
Rest here for a minute,

737
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,790
and I'll go gather the troops.

738
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,366
THOMPKINS:
How old are you?

739
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,269
Old enough to shoot you,
if that's what you're thinking.

740
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,171
No, that's not
what I was thinking.

741
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,407
You don't have to point
the gun at me.

742
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,608
I'm not gonna hurt you.

743
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,343
Damn right you're not.

744
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,644
My name is Lee.

745
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,847
I<i> know</i> what your name is.

746
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,782
What's your name?

747
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,617
You're cute.

748
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,885
For a doctor.

749
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,420
Thanks. You're cute.

750
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,988
For a gangster.

751
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,827
Hi, Selina.

752
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,596
Sorry about this, Lee.

753
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,865
Oh, hey, no problem.

754
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,001
(sighs heavily)

755
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,474
So...

756
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,377
is Bridgit okay?

757
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,046
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,015
She's not gonna make it.

759
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,387
You said that you'd help her.

760
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,156
I tried, Selina.
I tried.

761
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,458
But she didn't
want to go quietly.

762
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:07,230
I think she wanted it
to end this way.

763
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,073
Look...

764
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:20,510
Selina...
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

765
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,213
I know you were telling
the truth about Bridgit.

766
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,917
That her brothers
put her up to this.

767
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,653
I need to know who hired them.

768
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:32,856
I already told you I don't know.

769
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,225
And I still don't believe you.
What do you care?

770
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,060
You don't care about people
like us. It's not like

771
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,229
you're really gonna go after
your little friend.

772
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,997
My friend?

773
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,502
Do you mean Penguin?

774
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,073
Why would he set those fires?

775
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,441
That doesn't make any sense.

776
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,077
Ask him yourself.

777
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,415
I'm done talking to you.

778
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,386
I should have never

779
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,222
trusted a cop.

780
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:08,491
I tried to help her,
it just went a different way.

781
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,494
Is that what you call it
when someone dies?

782
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,432
Is that what you tell yourself?

783
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,867
I'm sorry.

784
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,704
(scoffs)

785
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,139
Whatever.

786
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,754
(both laugh gently)

787
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,330
You're so sweet.

788
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,566
Kristen, what's the matter?

789
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,902
Um... I'm scared.

790
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,571
Of what?

791
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,573
Of Tom Dougherty.

792
00:37:56,575 --> 00:38:00,076
He used to tell me...

793
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,711
if he ever saw me
with another man,

794
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,013
he would kill me.

795
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:06,883
I'm terrified of what will
happen when he comes back.

796
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,519
You don't need
to worry about that.
No...

797
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,288
you don't know him.

798
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,023
He is... (exhales) a monster.

799
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,342
Listen to me.

800
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,660
You do not need to worry
about Tom Dougherty.

801
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,463
You are sweet.

802
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,499
But... you're not a fighter.

803
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,968
You couldn't possibly
take him on.

804
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,538
Trust me, it's been
taken care of.

805
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,474
What does<i> that</i> mean?

806
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,945
Um...

807
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,515
Some time ago,
he and I had an altercation.

808
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,650
I asked him to treat you
with more respect.

809
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,818
Oh, my God.

810
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,919
And he said he would treat you

811
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,888
any way he liked
and he assaulted me.

812
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,755
Oh, my God!

813
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,024
So, anyhow,
long story short...

814
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,897
I killed him.

815
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,633
(laughing):
Oh, Ed, that's...

816
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,868
You had me going
for a minute, there.

817
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,438
It was outside of your apartment
under the elevated train.

818
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,672
I stabbed him and he died.

819
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,274
Ed, that's not funny.

820
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,543
I'm not being funny.

821
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,828
"T. Dougherty."

822
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,564
Do you believe me now?

823
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,533
Oh, my God.

824
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,972
What's wrong?
Uh...

825
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,774
How could you?
Where are you going?

826
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:40,910
No, please, sit down.
Don't touch me!

827
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,779
Would you please let me explain?
There is nothing

828
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,914
to explain.
I don't even know who you are.

829
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,950
No, that's wrong.
You are a murderer.

830
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,152
He was a monster! You said so!

831
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:50,887
He was abusing you.

832
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,790
I can't believe I even
fell for you, you sicko.

833
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,726
I'm not sick. I love you.
I did it<i> for</i> you.

834
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,596
Everything I ever
thought about you, I was right.

835
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,398
I should have my head examined.

836
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,732
Don't say that.

837
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,634
Wait, what were you
doing outside my house?

838
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,035
I was worried for you.

839
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,705
You were stalking me.
You are a psychopath.

840
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:11,207
That is not true!
That's not who I am.

841
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,575
Don't say that about me.

842
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,710
You are going to prison

843
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,578
where they will
do horrible things to you.

844
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,813
Things that
you deserve.

845
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,482
Don't say that to me.

846
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,017
No, let go. Don't touch me!

847
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,585
(grunts)

848
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,221
Let go of me, you freak.

849
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,890
Please don't call me that.

850
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,024
Oh!

851
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,994
Help!

852
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:33,596
Listen to me.
I am not the man

853
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,898
that you think I am.

854
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,100
I would never
do anything to hurt you.

855
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,203
I had to kill him
because he hit you.

856
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,805
Do you understand that?

857
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,140
I did it<i> for</i> you.

858
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,776
I promise I will never do
anything to hurt you ever again.

859
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,845
I love you.

860
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:51,114
I've loved you
since the first moment

861
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,615
that I saw you.

862
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:59,656
Kristen? Kristen?

863
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,158
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no... no, no.

864
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,227
Oh, no, plea...

865
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,230
Oh, no.

866
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,233
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

867
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,234
Please.

868
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,470
(sobs):
Please, no.

869
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,406
No. No.

870
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,644
(screams):
No!

MAN: Damn, this girl
looks rough.

875
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:18,902
They tell people she dead.

876
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,337
But that's a lie.
I heard the suit

877
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,539
she was wearing melted to her.

878
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,740
Say she's fireproof.

879
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,275
Come on.

880
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:26,709
Yeah, man-- fireproof.

881
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,044
That's why they sent
her down here,

882
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,180
with the rest
of the monsters.

883
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,383
For testing.
