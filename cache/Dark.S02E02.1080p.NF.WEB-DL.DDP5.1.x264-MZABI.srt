<i>Sending objects through the stabilized
matter has already proved possible.</i>

7

<i>A generator has to supply
sufficient AC current for that.</i>

<i>Even after lengthy observation,</i>

11
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,213
<i>there is no form of energy loss.</i>

00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:02,213
<i>It appears to be a type

<i>Still, no signs of decay
have been observed.</i>

15
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:23,255
<i>This is consistent
with the law of conservation of energy,</i>

16
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:26,130
<i>yet contradicts
the second law of thermodynamics.</i>

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,130
<i>Moreover, the matter seems to exist,

18

<i>in solid, liquid

Hey, sleepyhead.
We're running a bit late today.

25
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,755
Come on, everything will be fine.

26
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:19,588
Just one more week
and it's summer vacation.

27
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,838
It's my mother's birthday today.

28
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,588
You know what we said about that.

00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:45,880
The past is the past...

31
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:54,046
Shall we?

32
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:59,630
Come on.

33
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,880
<i>Regina, you'll be late!</i>

34
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:12,880
The French delegation
is visiting the plant. I just can't do it.

35
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:16,421
No problem.
I don't have anything else to do.

36
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,630
- Regina!
- I really can do this more often.

37
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,921
Regina!

38
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,046
Where did you find this little one?

39
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,880
- Looks like Gretchen.
- Nonsense.

40
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,630
Regina, where are you?

41
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,255
Listen.

42
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:45,130
I actually wanted to talk to you.

43
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,296
There's something I have to tell you.

44
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,046
Hi, Grandpa. Can we go?

45
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,921
No need to say bye. No problem!

46
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,296
You wanted to tell me something?

47
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,755
Never mind.

48
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,088

The interview with Mrs. Tiedemann.

55
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,505
- Already forgotten?
- No.

56
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:01,546
I thought you might do it alone after all.

57
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,963
Why? Do you have something better to do?

58
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,796
No. I just wonder
why we're starting with Mrs. Tiedemann.

59
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,588
She has no link
to any of the missing people.

60
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,338
Everyone disappeared near the caves
and the nuclear power plant grounds.

61
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:24,755
Your colleague Ulrich Nielsen's brother
disappeared in that area in 1986 as well.

62
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,338
And then...

63
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:31,171
there's also the door in the caves
leading right to the nuclear power plant.

00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,046
How long have Aleksander Tiedemann
and his wife been married?

65
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,088
I don't exactly know.

66
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,880
Regina was... in her mid-twenties.

67
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:45,463
Why?

68
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,296
Don't you find it unusual?

69
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,755
What?

70
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:53,630
That Aleksander Tiedemann
took his wife's name?

71
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,796
No.

72
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:00,046
Shall we go?

73
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:15,463
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

74
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:39,588
Hey, where have you been?

75
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,963
Why didn't you call me back?
I was trying to reach you the whole time.

76
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:49,755
Last year,
I know where you got the money.

77
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:54,046
Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.
Kinky stuff costs extra?

78
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,838
Who did you do it with, huh?
Who did you blow in this damn shithole?

79
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,963
Nothing has changed.
Everyone lies. Everyone cheats.

80
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:07,338
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- I followed you.

81
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,296
I know who you get your money from.

82
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,505
Your first thought
is that I prostitute myself?

83
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,130
What else?

84
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,546
I don't sell my tits or my ass!

85
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,880
I sell hormone therapy prescriptions,
you idiot!

86
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,296
My father used to use them
to pay for his visits.

87
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,130
He stopped going,
and now I'm the new supplier.

88
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,713
Why do you do it?

89
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:34,505
I help her, she helps me.
It's that simple.

90
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:41,380
The secrets aren't the problem,
it's the shit we all project onto others.

91
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:45,380
I said it's none of your fucking business,
and it isn't!

92
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:49,130
I can't believe you spied on me.
How messed up are you?

93
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,338
What's that?

94
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,213
A time machine.

95
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,380
This machine takes you 33 years
into the past

96
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:49,296
and 33 years into the future.

97
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,296
You're serious?

98
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:08,088
I did it all wrong.

99
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,421
I tried to keep a secret.

100
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,630
The truth is,
that is exactly what's destroying us.

101
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,713
The secrets.

102
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,713
Mom, I know that sounds insane.

103
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:26,505
That's why I want you to see for yourself.

104
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,046
With your own eyes.

105
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,796
What do you mean?

106
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,463
Dad's secret.

107
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,255
Out of the way, dork!

108
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,796
Hannah, come on!

109
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,463
What are you staring at?

110
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:32,921
Thank God you're here.
Someone's waiting for you in your office.

111
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,255
I didn't know.

112
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,713
About the dog.

113
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:42,130
She says it's hers.

114
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,421
Is that your dog?

115
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,421
I'm so sorry.

116
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,880
She ran up to me.

117
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:14,880
We called the shelter,
but no one had reported her missing.

118
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,380
- And she resembles the dog I had as a kid.
- Gretchen.

119
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,005
How do you know that?

120
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:36,380
Because it's my dog.

121
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,171
Just like it's yours.

122
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,338
Excuse me?

123
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,380
<i>And the blood test results?</i>

124
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:56,171
So it has already spread.

125
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,130
To the hospital?

No.

128
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,838
Yes, that should work.

129
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,338
Don't worry. I have someone.

130
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:17,546

Our secretary will approach
the desk on the right in a moment.

143

She'll fan her face on the way.

144
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,546
Watch Kowaltschik.

145
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,713
He's about to drop his pen.

146
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:58,921
How did you do that?

147
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,588
I experienced it all.

148
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,630
Everything you've ever experienced
and everything you ever will.

149
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,755
I am you.

150
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,421
And I was told by me
that you and I are the same person.

That's impossible.

This is Gretchen.

00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:30,755
The day she ran into the cave
I was there waiting for her.

154
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:34,130
She recognized me at once,
as if I hadn't aged a second.

155
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,755
I brought her to the other side
so you would find her.

Some things have to happen

The cave.

00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,338

00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:24,421
The book we're reading at school.

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,046
It's about the ghosts and demons

164
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,671
that we inherit from our parents.

165
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,005
And...

166
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,880
that you pass them on.

167
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:36,963
Dark stuff.

168
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:41,255
From generation to generation.

169
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,630
Maybe.

170
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:51,463
But you sure inherited
your mother's best features.

171
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,755
I didn't even know she had any.

172
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:55,838
No?

173
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,671
You have no idea.

174
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,630
She... She's never around.

175
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,630
And when she is,
all she does is gripe about me.

176
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,671
She has never once said
"I love you" to me.

177
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,005
I love you.

178
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,005
How would you describe
your relationship with Ulrich Nielsen?

179
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:37,296
I think it's known that we have
no relationship with the Nielsens.

180
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:43,755
Yet he showed up at your hotel
the day before he disappeared.

181
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,380
What did he want?

182
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:51,713
He wanted to know
what really happened in 1986.

183
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,671
Because I was the last one...

184
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,921
to see his brother alive.

185
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,630
Your husband.

186
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:06,546
How long has he lived in Winden?

187
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:12,255
Since 1986. Why do you ask?

188
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:14,588
Why did he take your last name?

189
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,046
What does one have to do with the other?

190
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:20,463
If we're done...

191
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,630
There's still something.

192
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,171
Isn't there?

193
00:23:36,255 --> 00:23:38,546
Last year, a stranger came to the hotel.

194
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:41,296
Those are his things.

195
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:50,838
He wanted a room.

196
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,796
He looked like a homeless person.

197
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:57,505
He paid cash.

198
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,255
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

199
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,130
He left after a few days,
but he wanted to keep the room.

200
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:05,755
He never came back.

201
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,046
These were all over his walls.

202
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:17,296
As he was leaving, he asked me
to mail a package for him.

203
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:19,213
To whom?

204
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:22,213
Jonas Kahnwald.

205
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,796
Why did you not report this?

206
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:41,713
I have to go. Elisabeth has a swim class.
I totally forgot.

207
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,421
Sorry. You can take a taxi.

208
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,463
Well...

209
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:18,380
This stranger,

210
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:23,005
what did he look like?

211
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:51,463
What is this?

212
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:58,130
What are we doing here?

213
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:01,546
It's safer to travel from here.

214
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:20,380
I told you it would be easier
to understand once you've seen it.

215
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,213
Don't be scared.

216
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:42,755
Shouldn't you be at school?

217
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,213
I know you.

218
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,963
You were in the hospital.

219
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:02,838
I like coming here.

220
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,380
Special place.

221
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
So...

222
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,588
Why aren't you at school?

223
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:20,713
I see.

224
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:24,005
Sometimes we don't really know
where we're supposed to be<i>.</i>

225
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:30,130
But I wouldn't go in there.

226
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,838
It's like a maze in there.

227
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,713
Some have never returned.

228
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:43,963
In the hospital<i>,</i>

229
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:45,921
you said something.

230
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:52,005
The thing about God,
and that he has a plan for everyone.

231
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,713
But what if God
has no idea what he's doing?

232
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:59,338
If the plan is wrong? If God is mistaken?

233
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:02,796
God doesn't make mistakes.

234
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,588
Sometimes we have to have more faith
that everything will be okay again.

235
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,880
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

236
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:38,130
To come by.

237
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,880
Now that I'm retired, I have time.

238
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,755
I...

239
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,296
Mads' disappearance.

240
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,380
I can't stop thinking about it.

241
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,213
On that day...

242
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,213
you had a shift
at the nuclear power plant.

243
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:16,630
You said you took the country road home,
but that's a detour.

244
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:21,296
Why didn't you take the forest road?

245
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,005
He... He said...

246
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,338
he can change everything.

247
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:33,421
He can change the past, and the future.

248
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,588
Who said that?

249
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,171
The man with the stone.

250
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:43,171
But that was 30 years ago.
What does that have to do with Mads?

251
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:46,338
But no one can change it. No one.

252
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,046
Not even the White Devil.

253
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,838
The White Devil?

254
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:56,380
You've said that before.
Back then, as a child.

255
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,880
Tick, tock.

256
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,796
Tick, tock.

257
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,088
Tick, tock...

258
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:15,046
<i>I'd like you to trust in an idea
that's bigger than you.</i>

259
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,171
Bigger than any of us.

260
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,713
What's that?

261
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:26,380
This is humankind's greatest discovery.

262
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,213
And also its doom.

263
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,338
It allows you to travel through time.

264
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:35,838
Thirty three years back.

265
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,213
Thirty three years forward.

266
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:44,921
And it will take exactly 33 years
for the cycle to be completed again.

267
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:48,130
Until you are standing
where I am standing now

268
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:51,088
and accept your role
in this never-ending dance,

269
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:53,880
and every sacrifice it requires.

270
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,255
In five days, everything will start over.

271
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:00,171
You must stop Adam.

272
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,296
Who is Adam?

273
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:07,921
You don't understand it yet.

274
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:12,755
But you soon will.

275
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,880
Until then, everything will happen
as it always has.

276
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,630
As it must.

277
00:32:30,963 --> 00:32:34,838
In the end, life is just a collection
of missed opportunities.

278
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:39,255
You don't have much more time with Regina.

279
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:43,213
But if everything works out...

280
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,171
she will live.

281
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:03,630
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME
H.G. TANNHAUS

282
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:11,296
<i>Charlotte?</i>

283
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:14,755
Charlotte?

284
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,255
- Is everything okay?
- Last year when the children disappeared,

285
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,671
a man was in Regina's hotel.

286
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,963
<i>He had drawings with him.</i>

287
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,338
<i>Copies.</i>

288
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,713
What kind of drawings?

289
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:31,921
They're from the book!

290
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:35,255
The book my grandfather wrote.
<i>A Journey Through Time.</i>

291
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:39,588
- <i>Everyone always said he was nuts.</i>
- Where are you?

292
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:42,171
<i>But he knew that it was all true!</i>

293
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,296
Why did he have that photo?

294
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,338
Why did he never tell me
who my parents really were?

295
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:21,796
You know the rules.

296
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,921
Do you think they don't apply to you?

297
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,213
Why are you lying to them?

298
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,255
Why don't you tell them
what's really in the dead zone?

299
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,796
In five days, in my time,
everybody is going to die.

300
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:52,963
I have to stop that.

301
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,630
There is no prophecy!

302
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:59,630
The passage will never open.

303
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:03,005
Your paradise does not exist!

304
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
But behind that wall...

305
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,421
WINDEN BOY MISSING

306
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:45,130
Hello? Egon here.

307
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,588
Yes.

308
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,421
MISSING PERSON REPORT:
MADS NIELSEN

309
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,338
Listen, in 1953 we arrested a man.

310
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,005
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

311
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,463
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
AFTER 1953?

312
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,463
He killed two kids back then.
Then he abducted Helge Doppler.

313
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:58,005
NO RESULT

314
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:02,296
I wanted to know what became of him.

315
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,713
Yes, I'll hold.

316
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:11,880
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

317
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,380
Yes.

318
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:16,421
Okay, that's the case.

319
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,838
What? He's still here?

320
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:23,671
Where?

321
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,588
- Yes?
- Chief Inspector Tiedemann.

322
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,546
I'd like to speak to a patient.

323
00:37:58,463 --> 00:38:00,588
Weren't you notified I was coming?

324
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:03,130
Not that I know of.

325
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:05,755
Well...

326
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:08,838
File number...

327
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,213
K53.

328
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,296
He must have been here for 34 years now.

329
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,671
The Inspector?

330
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:23,713
We call him that here.

331
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:26,755
Nice guy. He's been here longer
than most of the staff.

332
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,880
Practically part of the furniture.

333
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:33,255
- He'll be glad to have a visitor.
- Does he...

334
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,921
Does he get day-release?

335
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,380
No, he's in the closed ward.

336
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,588
The guy over there,
with the long gray hair.

337
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,671
Thanks.

338
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,338
Excuse me, please.

339
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:24,380
You may not remember me anymore.

340
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:28,588
My name is Egon Tiedemann.

341
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:32,171
I arrested you 34 years ago.

342
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,713
Egon Tiedemann.

343
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,338
How could I ever forget you?

344
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:54,296
I...

345
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,880
I wanted...

346
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,463
I have a few questions.

347
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,005
My only aim is to take many lives.
The more the better I feel.

348
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,046
I know that.

349
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:21,130
You've said that before.

350
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,130
What does it mean?

351
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:29,046
It means that you, you moron,
still haven't understood a thing.

352
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:35,171
But now you have to hurry.
You don't have much time left.

353
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,838
I know when you die.

354
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:40,380
It was in the paper.

355
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,213
I don't understand.

356
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:47,755
No, of course you don't.

357
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:51,421
But maybe that is also your fate.

358
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:54,838
To die as clueless as you were
when you were born.

359
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,505
Everyone gets what they deserve.

360
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:22,671
Where have you been?

361
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,921
I was so worried.

362
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:35,171
I called the school.
They said you never showed up there.

363
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:39,796
Did something happen?

364
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,213
You know what?

365
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:54,921
There are days it's best to just forget.

366
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,546
But...

367
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:05,005
there's no better comfort food
than "Toast Hawaii."

368
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,838
We always had it at home
when I was little,

369
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,755
with two maraschino cherries.

370
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,421
And my dad used to dance,

371
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:13,838
like Elvis.

372
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,838
PINEAPPLES

373
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,713
Do you believe in God?

374
00:42:25,213 --> 00:42:27,546
Do you believe he has a plan for us?

375
00:42:34,046 --> 00:42:36,713
I believe... he does.

376
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:42,255
I believe, for example, that God saw to it

377
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:44,130
that you came to me.

378
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,380
And that his plan for me is

379
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,213
to be there for you.

380
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:57,755
Right, let's make "Toast Hawaii," okay?

381
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:00,088
Will you help me?

382
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,005
Why didn't she kill you?

383
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:25,130
Who are you really?

384
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:29,296
Who are you?

385
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:55,630
I want you to show me.

386
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,463
What's really in the dead zone.

387
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,338
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

388
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:01,963
BUILDING YOUR FAMILY'S HAPPINESS

389
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,255
What is that?

390
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:40,796
She said it's a portal.

391
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:42,588
Who?

392
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,630
I have tapes
with a woman speaking on them.

393
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:48,046
Her name is Claudia Tiedemann.

394
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,880
I know none of this makes sense,
but that may be the only way back home.

395
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,838
No clue if it works.

396
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:22,171
You want to go in?

397
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:28,255
It doesn't matter
if I die inside it or out here.

398
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:58,046
Jonas!

399
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:25,755
