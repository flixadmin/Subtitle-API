1
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:56,439
They've broken through
the front lines!

2
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,075
I've lost contact
with the capital!

3
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,611
There's too many of them!

4
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,015
Stand fast!

5
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,217
Finish them!

6
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,532
Where's B-127?

7
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,079
Sorry I'm late.
I hit a little traffic.

8
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,048
Get down!
Incoming!

9
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,051
Uh, Optimus.

10
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:45,289
Decepticons, attack!

11
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,928
Autobots, fall back!
Get to the tower!

12
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,034
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

13
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:03,941
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

14
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,144
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

15
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,478
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

16
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,017
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

17
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:21,792
We will fight on. But we
must find refuge first.

18
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,462
I found a planet that's well hidden.
Earth.

19
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:28,398
You will travel there and
establish a base for us.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,201
Once we've gathered the
others, we'll join you.

21
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,036
You must protect
the planet.

22
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:38,076
If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.

23
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,445
Now go!

24
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:58,030
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

25
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,393
No!

26
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:03,827
Ow! Ow! Ow!

27
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:04,695
Okay, okay!

28
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,699
I'm dead already,
man!

29
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,967
Oh, not just you.

30
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,501
Being the overachiever
that you are,

31
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,771
you managed to get your
whole squad killed, Danny.

32
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:14,639
Bravo.

33
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,873
Come on, man.
Those things sting.

34
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,842
- What things? These things?
- Ow!

35
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,978
You know, I wouldn't know. I haven't been hit yet.

36
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,546
Ow! Okay, you know what? That's too close, man.

37
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,881
You could've taken out an eye.

38
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:26,250
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

39
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,518
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Ow!

40
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,820
That one was on me.

41
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:31,788
That's a malfunctioning
trigger.

42
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,925
This weapon is just faulty. Someone
is going to get a talking to...

43
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,093
Man, would you stop?

44
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:37,931
All right, just stop.

45
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,199
I should've
let you die in Grenada.

46
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,967
If you did, we wouldn't be
able to come to the forest,

47
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,003
run around and play
these awesome games.

48
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,204
Exactly.

49
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,007
Oh, I hate you.

50
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,276
Wow, man, that hurts.
'Cause I love you.

51
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:55,079
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

52
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,948
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

53
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,818
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

54
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:02,987
Hey, yo, take cover!

55
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,103
Danny.

56
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,170
You okay?

57
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,907
Uh, yeah, man.

58
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,411
This is Agent Jack Burns.

59
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,312
I need medical
up here now.

60
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:28,579
We have
a projectile strike

61
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,615
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

62
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,484
Multiple injuries.

63
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:37,355
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

64
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,825
<i>Negative. There are no
live fire drills in the northwest sector.</i>

65
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,829
What the hell hit us, then?

66
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,143
Target on your right!

67
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,297
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

68
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,633
Drive!

69
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:28,174
There!

70
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,044
What the hell?

71
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,147
Take it down!

72
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,787
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

73
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,922
There it is!

74
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:53,867
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

75
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,336
Light it up!

76
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,182
Damn it!

77
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,660
Oh, no.

78
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:34,108
It's going for the mine!
Cut it off!

79
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,024
Move, move!

80
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:05,937
Please.

81
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,774
This is a mistake.

82
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,376
Stay cool.
Hold your fire.

83
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,312
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

84
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,189
Who called in the Air Force?

85
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,229
That's not the Air Force.

86
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,867
Run.

87
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,124
Did you think you could hide?

88
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:11,870
Now you'll die screaming.

89
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,074
Like your friends!

90
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,843
Tell me where
your friends are hiding.

91
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:53,579
I'll never talk.

92
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,317
Is that right?

93
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,151
Then let's
make it official.

94
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,783
B-127...

95
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,318
As a member
of the Autobot resistance,

96
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,787
you are a traitor
to Cybertron

97
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,291
and are hereby sentenced

98
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,294
to death.

99
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,302
No!

100
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,371
No!

101
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,565
Ugh.

102
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,733
Shut up.

119
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,451
Excuse me.

120
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,554
Are those
your diving trophies?

121
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,354
Taking up too much space
in my room.

122
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,358
You're gonna
regret doing that.

123
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,760
Where's breakfast?

124
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:03,964
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

125
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,064
- Ah.
- Try to help out...

126
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,699
- Yeah.
- ...a little.

127
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,769
Since I'm such a big kid now, making
my own breakfast and what have you,

128
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:13,707
you know how I could be an even
bigger help around here, Mom?

129
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,042
If I had a car.

130
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,175
Charlie.

131
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,978
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

132
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,380
perfect timing
for a large cash gift.

133
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,816
You know, $500 is really all
I need to finish the Corvette.

134
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:27,253
I don't have $500. You
know how much nurses make.

135
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:29,823
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

136
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,123
Tell you what, kiddo...

137
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,592
I got another
job interview tomorrow.

138
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,028
If all goes well, I'll have
you swimming in car parts.

139
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,797
I prefer cash, Ron.

Don't be rude.
Feed the dog.

141
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:41,068
Conan is Otis's dog.
Make him do it.

142
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,436
What?

143
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,172
Aw! You look so grown
up in your karate suit.

144
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,143
My baby boy
is becoming a man.

145
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,545
Oh, shoot,
I'm gonna be late.

146
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:55,214
Can you drop your brother at
karate on your way to work, please?

147
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,050
Um, I could if I had a car.

148
00:14:57,052 --> 00:15:00,687
Just let him follow you on your
bike so nobody abducts him.

149
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,824
Abducts him? You just
said he's a grown man now.

150
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:07,496

156
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:45,264
All right.

We've never actually met...

159
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,511
Sorry, I can't right now.

160

00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:08,488

If I had to wear that,
I would pray to be fired.

00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,725
He survived the fall
of Cybertron.

199
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,760
And no rebellion

So where is he?

202
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,636
My name is Cliffjumper, lieutenant
in the Autobot resistance.

00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:52,014
Tell us where it is

- Already did.

Never.

how you're still open.

221
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:50,606
Just take it. Go.
My show is on.

222
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,809
Hey, where did you
get that Beetle?

223
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,446
I swear to God, ever since
they put up that dumbass tower,

224
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:00,916
I can't get a signal
to watch my shows.

225
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:03,253
I've got to see what happens
to Alf this week.

226
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:15,663
Come on!

227
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,612
Are you kidding me?

228
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,920

229
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,028

<i>No dinner

237
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:10,117

I've been fasting since lunch!</i>

238
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,791

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,139
- Good morning, birthday girl!

248
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,609
You look...

249
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,378
Nice.

250
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,012
Happy birthday, baby.

251
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,051
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

252
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,121
Thanks, Mom.

253
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,293
Helmet. With...

254
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,161
Daffodils.

255
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,895
So, I keep hearing

256
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:30,899
about people on mopeds getting run
over and their brains smashed in.

257
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,701
You got to wear this
from now on.

258
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,670
I don't care if it's not
the law. It's our law.

259
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,741
Plus, look how cute it is.

260
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,143
Yeah.

261
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:42,711
Happy birthday.

262
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,013
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

263
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,086
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

264
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,693
A smile is a powerful thing.

265
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,227
It releases endorphins.

266
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,432
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

267
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,870
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

268
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,673
actually have more friends.

269
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,842
That's unbelievable.

270
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:14,809
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

271
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,080
if you smile more often.

272
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:34,965
I want the Beetle.

273
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,067
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

274
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:40,303
I'll make you a deal. If I get
that thing started, it's mine.

275
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:43,239
That's no deal. That's
just you taking my car.

276
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:47,243
If I get it started, I keep it and
I work here every day for a year!

277
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,378
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

278
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,481
I will pick up and organize every
scrap of paper in this place.

279
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:56,220
I'll even detail your
horrible, disgusting toilets.

280
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,391
Please.
It's my birthday.

281
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,493
Sorry, no deal.

282
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,729
'Cause we ain't hiring.

283
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,267
It's yours, kid.
Happy birthday.

284
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,371

00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,302
- It really runs?
- Yeah, it really runs.

324
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,305
Cool.

325
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:18,915
You still in there?

326
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:23,987
Okay.

327
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,058
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.

328
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,469
Okay.

329
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,161
Hi.

330
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,610
Oh, God, are you...

331
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,115
Do you speak?

332
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,062
I won't hurt you.

333
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:04,591
Can you understand me?

334
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,463
What are you?

335
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,766
Where did you come from?

336
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,667
Okay. It's okay.

337
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,246
You like my shirt?

338
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,382
You a metal fan?

339
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,284
No, wait...

340
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,754
Oh, who? Me?

341
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:37,189
Who am I?

342
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:40,192
Oh, I'm...

343
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,694
Charlie.

344
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,428
Charlie Watson.

345
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,300
I'm 18.

346
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,300
Today.

347
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,471
Actually, it's
my birthday today.

348
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:54,707
What's your name?

349
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,579
You don't know
or you don't have a name?

350
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,619
You sound like
a little bumblebee.

351
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,659
I'm gonna call you that
from now on.

352
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,696
Bumblebee.

353
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,230
Matches your outfit, too.

354
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:44,189
<i>♪ All my exes live in Texas ♪</i>

355
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,426
I want a divorce, Roy!

356
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,594
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

357
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:52,730
You tried to sleep
with my sister!

358
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,131
Unsuccessfully!

359
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,599
Yeah, you're unsuccessful
at everything.

360
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,270
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

361
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:02,807
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

362
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,412
Now, just settle down for
one second and hear me out.

363
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,950
- What the hell is that?
- What?

364
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:16,954
Oh, God, Roy, that thing
is coming right for us!

365
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,756
No, no, no, no, no...

366
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,557
Not my car. Not my car.

367
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,895
Please, God, no, not my car!

368
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:35,875
Oh, thank God, my car.

369
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,309
Yeah, I'm okay.

370
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:41,379
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.

371
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,983
Run. Run!

372
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,263
Oh...

373
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:01,901
God!

374
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,804
Is that my car?

375
00:34:07,774 --> 00:34:08,841
Hello...

376
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,321
Jeez!

377
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,856
Earth.

378
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,792
- Roy!
- Oh!

379
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,193
How underwhelming.

380
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:32,732
The indigenous life is even
more primitive than I expected.

381
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,667
Hey...

382
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:41,072
Hmm. I like
the way they pop.

383
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,673
Focus, comrade.

384
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:48,079
B-127's distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

385
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,817
For now, we head west.

386
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:07,331
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

387
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,800
I don't know,
but I hope soon.

388
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:11,604
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

389
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:14,674
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

390
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,077
Morning...

391
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:21,747
Bee?

392
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,084
Bee, where are you?

393
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,256
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

394
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,324
Bee!

395
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,994
Where did you go?

396
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,498
Otis!

397
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Have you seen my car?

398
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:44,602
Unfortunately, yes.

399
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,704
No, have you seen
my car today?

400
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,007
It was in the garage.
Someone stole it!

401
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,675
No, idiot. Mom took it.

402
00:35:50,677 --> 00:35:52,143
She had to bring Conan to the vet

403
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,246
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

404
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,114
and Ron needed
the station wagon.

405
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,550
Thank God.

406
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:01,420
Wait.

407
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,959
Hi. Excuse me.
It's me again.

408
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,230
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

409
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,898
Nope. Yep.

410
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,399
Okay.

411
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,907
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

412
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,575
You can't eat
everything you see.

413
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:27,713
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

414
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:32,585
Oh, my God. Stop it!
Don't do that!

415
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,058
Bee, no!

416
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,831
- Mom?
- Whoa!

417
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,199
Jesus! Charlie,
what are you doing?

418
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,533
Mom, you gotta pull over.

419
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:52,503
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

420
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:55,441
Okay, okay. All right.

421
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:01,980
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

422
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,581
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

423
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,083
I thought
I was being carjacked.

424
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:06,685
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

425
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:10,755
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

426
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,524
He's my dog, too, you know.

427
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:15,126
What happened to Conan
being Otis's dog?

428
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,028
Mom, you're
being hysterical, okay?

429
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,331
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

430
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,168
I know how you get
during emergencies.

431
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:23,171
I'm a nurse.

432
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,506
Not of animals.

433
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:34,012
Oh, okay. I'm happy
for you to drive.

434
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:36,349
You weren't wearing
your helmet, by the way.

435
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,918
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

436
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,420
Keep it together, Bee.

437
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,065
Sir?

438
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:53,466
Sir.

439
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:55,869
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

440
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,674
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

441
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,809
Two of them just
made contact in Texas.

442
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:07,045
Intel says they're heading
west fast.

443
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,648
Saddle up, Simmons.

444
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:11,052
We're going to Texas.

445
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:15,822
Okay, Bee, we need
to go over a few things.

446
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,597
Okay. We're all clear.

447
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:29,167
All right.
I'm re-thinking the beach.

448
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:30,170
Ugh.

449
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:33,605
Oh, I'm good.

450
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,209
No, I'm good, thanks.

451
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:41,147
People can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

452
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:43,848
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

453
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,550
and cut you
into tiny little pieces.

454
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:48,622
It'll be bad, trust me.

455
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:55,862
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

456
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:00,132
So let's practice.
You ready?

457
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:02,203
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

458
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,808
Great. Perfect.
Come back now.

459
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:12,744
Okay, so let's say we're
driving and all of a sudden...

460
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:15,283
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

461
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,163
You serious?

462
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,635
Bee, it's too late.
You're already dead.

463
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:40,905
It's all right.

464
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:44,843
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

465
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:48,649
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

466
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,067
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

467
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,671
First contact
with an alien species.

468
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:15,741
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

469
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:18,946
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

470
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:37,564
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

471
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:41,169
Not yet. B-127's
signal has gone silent.

472
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,038
I have an idea.

473
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,941
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

474
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:52,744
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

475
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,647
So state your business.

476
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:56,515
People of Earth,

477
00:40:56,517 --> 00:41:00,719
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

478
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:02,656
What are you doing?

479
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,723
This is humiliating.

480
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:07,860
We believe a dangerous
criminal from our world

481
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:10,996
is hiding somewhere
on yours.

482
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:12,867
How is it you think
we can help?

483
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,804
We need your eyes.

484
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:18,804
Wait.

485
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,073
You want access
to our satellites?

486
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,742
Our scanners'
range is limited.

487
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,079
Your infrastructure
is primitive.

488
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:30,950
But combined, they
could be quite powerful.

489
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,586
No way!
Out of the question!

490
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:35,555
We have a common enemy,
Agent Burns.

491
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:37,890
There's a war raging
on our planet.

492
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:42,696
If B-127 isn't found, that
war may find its way here.

493
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,830
Perhaps...

494
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:48,034
We can find a way
to help one another.

495
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:49,935
We'll talk it over
with our superiors.

496
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:52,972
In the meantime,
if you could follow us.

497
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:55,642
Very well,
friend Powell.

498
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,479
Take us to your leader.

499
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:11,126
Must suck being
cooped up in a VW all day, huh?

500
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,995
Is there anyone
that can help you?

501
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:16,630
Do you have a family?

502
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:19,733
You know, like a mom,
dad, siblings?

503
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:21,135
You all love each other?

504
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,104
Or drive each other crazy

505
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,942
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

506
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:35,951
Do you want me
to see if I can fix it?

507
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,888
I'll be gentle, I promise.

508
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:50,963
Whoa.

509
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:56,203
You lay down, okay?

510
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,076
Hold still.

511
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,547
I think maybe
there's something...

512
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:22,862
<i>B-127,
I pray this message finds you.</i>

513
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:26,433

Are you okay?

521
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,330
Who was that?

522
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:33,335
That voice said something
about a war.

523
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,271
Do you remember anything?

524
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:43,679
Is the VW Beetle
some kind of disguise?

525
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,082
Are you hiding
from something?

526
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,453
Are you scared?

527
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:05,401
It's broken.

528
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:08,968
It's okay.

529
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,037
I think I can help.

If we tell them no,

they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,687
Do you really want to go down in history

Fine.

614
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,696
We'll help them

00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,541

629
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,479
The telephones? Yes, why?

630
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,785
You got to pick
a station, man.

631
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,453

00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,904
Look, I know what you saw was
a little crazy. I can explain.

652
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,639
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:58,415
- Right? Yeah. So...
- Love that.

805
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,553
- You see these right here?
- Mmm-hmm.

806
01:02:02,954 --> 01:02:06,122
You grab one
of these, like so.

807
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:09,259
- And that right there, that's your target.
- That's right.

808
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,565
All right? Just throw
it like this.

809
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,899
I think we could
just hand it to him...

810
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:16,235
He could maybe,
yeah, and then...

811
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,604
Uh...

812
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,742
- Bee, what are...
- What, um...

813
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,685
Don't hurt me.

814
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,522
Oh, my God...

815
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:42,694
Oh, shit!

816
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,168
- Hide, hide, hide.
- Hide!

817
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,937
- Stay...
- Oh, okay!

818
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,404
Okay. Okay.

819
01:02:54,406 --> 01:02:55,674
Hide, Bee!

820
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:09,154
Go, go, go!

821
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,771
Mom!

822
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:42,152
That was insane!

823
01:03:42,154 --> 01:03:44,022
My heart right now

824
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,088
is going crazy.

825
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,593
Uh-oh!

826
01:03:47,394 --> 01:03:49,093
- Oh, God.
- Stop the car, please.

827
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,497
Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

Oh, my God, we're

836
01:04:42,816 --> 01:04:44,649
We got a yellow vehicle

837
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:47,387
driving its damn self
through the Pico Tunnel.

838

I got to go to work, okay?

843
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:08,833
Bee. Listen to me. You need
to stay in this garage, okay?

844
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,069
After what
happened last night,

845
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:12,071
I'm pretty sure the cops
are looking for you,

846
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:14,775
and, uh, you don't
exactly blend in.

847
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,642
I'll be back, all right?

848
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,415
Here.

849
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:25,919
You can have my Pop-Tart.

01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:43,836
We're out of sticks.

853
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:46,539
Can't we just sell the
hot dogs without the sticks?

854
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,107
No.

01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:33,807
Near San Francisco. A coastal

What were you thinking?
What...

865
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:34,602
I told you to hide
in the garage!

866
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,037
Great.

This is all my fault.

869
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,182
I never should
have left you.

870
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,785
Hey, okay, maybe
don't transform all the way?

871
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:56,188
We've still got to get
you through the door.

872
01:10:57,426 --> 01:10:58,827
Come on, buddy.

873
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:01,096

01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,763
And now you're
crippled for life.

876
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:39,833
Honey, watch the hair.

877
01:11:45,508 --> 01:11:48,308
Go. Now. But be quiet.

878
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,809
Mom, wait!

01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,281
Oh, my God!

- What happened?

881
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:00,119
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

882
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:01,487
What'd you do to my TV?

883
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:05,158
Look, Mom, I can explain. We will
talk about this later, all right?

884
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,460
- Now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

885
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:08,861
No. You're not
going anywhere.

886
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:11,664
- It's about my car. It's really important.
- About your car?

887
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:15,968
That you spend all day and night shut in
that garage, doing God-knows-what with?

888
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,071
Mom, I can't.
I really can't right now.

889
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:20,507
Oh, no, you really can,
Charlie.

890
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:22,543
You really can.

891
01:12:22,545 --> 01:12:23,709
I have had it!

892
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:26,279
Your attitude,
your always sulking around.

893
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:29,916
You brought home that piece of
crap without even asking me!

894
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:32,953
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

895
01:12:32,955 --> 01:12:35,556
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

896
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:37,357
You know, Mom,
just because you've moved on

897
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,927
and you're happy with your
new life doesn't mean I have!

898
01:12:40,929 --> 01:12:43,696
You've found a replacement
for my dad and I haven't,

899
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:44,831
okay, and I never will!

900
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,200
So I'm sorry if that
makes things harder,

901
01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:48,968
but in ten months from now

902
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,872
you won't even have
to deal with me!

903
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:54,008
Charlie!

904
01:13:04,018 --> 01:13:05,354
Hey, you okay?

905
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:08,223
Yeah.

906
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:12,959
I just feel like
ever since my dad died,

907
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:16,131
I've become this drain
on everyone, and I hate it.

908
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:18,998
It's like everybody expects me

909
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,101
to act like
nothing ever happened,

910
01:13:21,103 --> 01:13:23,738
and it's impossible
to do that.

911
01:13:25,874 --> 01:13:29,078
About your dad,
I'm really sorry.

912
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:31,545
Thanks.

913
01:13:31,547 --> 01:13:34,316
You know, there's
this quote that I like.

914
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:39,387
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

915
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,161
That's nice.

916
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:47,997
My mom got it
from Weight Watchers.

917
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:05,479
Get out and move
away from the vehicle.

918
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,481
Stay cool, Bee.

919
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:18,659
What's going on?

920
01:14:20,162 --> 01:14:21,061
Hey!

921
01:14:21,063 --> 01:14:22,830
- Come on!
- Stop it!

922
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:25,131
Let go of me!

923
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,402
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

924
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:30,269
No, don't run.
Do not run!

925
01:14:34,143 --> 01:14:35,209
She ran.

926
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:00,336
Please tell me
they're on our side.

927
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:15,349
No more running.

928
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:17,451
No more hiding.

929
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:25,727
B-127, you're a traitor
and a coward.

930
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,130
Tell us where
Optimus Prime is hiding.

931
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,202
Bee, look out!

932
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:36,937
Why isn't he fighting back?

933
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,804
Why don't you fight?

934
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:40,409
Leave him alone!
Please!

935
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:45,846
Again.

936
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:50,219
Hit it again!

937
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,320
Stop! Stop it!

938
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

939
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:29,022
She's been
having trouble adjusting,

940
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:31,725
but we had no idea
it was this serious.

941
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:32,959
I...

942
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:34,362
Charlie. Honey.

943
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:37,532
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

944
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:38,932
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

945
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:41,335
I can assure you
that it is an "it".

946
01:16:41,337 --> 01:16:43,471
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

947
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:46,808
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

948
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,243
I don't know
what he is, but...

949
01:16:50,245 --> 01:16:51,945
He's my friend.

950
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:54,815
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

951
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:57,018
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

952
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,319
She's disoriented.

953
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,987
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

954
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:03,857
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

955
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:06,195
Stop! Just go
to your room.

956
01:17:13,202 --> 01:17:15,270
When I was going
through puberty,

957
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:18,572
I stole things, too.

958
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:21,444
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

959
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,221
Boom.

960
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:08,891
Caught you.

961
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,826
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

962
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:12,593
Look, Otis, you need
to go home and...

963
01:18:12,595 --> 01:18:14,095
Mom!

964
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:16,997
No, Otis, stop it! Why would you do that?

965
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:19,734
Let go of me! You're touching my buttocks!

966
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,572
I will tell you a secret
if you shut up.

967
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:27,642
Okay, so, um,
this is my room.

968
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,309
Just make yourself at home.

969
01:18:29,311 --> 01:18:31,411
These are actually
my sister's stuff.

970
01:18:31,413 --> 01:18:34,382
She likes playing pranks, like
putting her stuff over here.

971
01:18:34,384 --> 01:18:36,584
- Can I, uh, sit down?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

972
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,252
<i>Residents of
Brighton Falls have been witness</i>

973
01:18:38,254 --> 01:18:40,655
<i>to an unusual sight
this evening.</i>

974
01:18:40,657 --> 01:18:44,158
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

975
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,060
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

976
01:18:47,062 --> 01:18:49,797
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon Air Base.</i>

977
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:53,066
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

978
01:18:53,068 --> 01:18:55,168
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

979
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,073
Count me in. I'll take point.

980
01:18:58,074 --> 01:18:59,741
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

981
01:18:59,743 --> 01:19:01,175
No, Otis.

982
01:19:01,177 --> 01:19:03,578
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

983
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,782
I need someone reliable to make sure that
Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

984
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,285
I'm someone reliable.

985
01:19:11,019 --> 01:19:12,388
Hell, yeah, you are.

986
01:19:17,327 --> 01:19:18,528
Good luck.

987
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:20,662
You, too.

988
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:22,131
Get over here.

989
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,336
Oh.

990
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:29,506
Let's do this.

991
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:33,140
Tell us where

992
01:19:33,142 --> 01:19:35,142
Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

993
01:19:35,144 --> 01:19:38,114
and we can end this war.

994
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,215
Talk!

995
01:19:41,217 --> 01:19:43,451
Who is Optimus Prime?

996
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:46,055
This doesn't
concern you, human Powell.

997
01:19:46,423 --> 01:19:48,526
Last chance.

998
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:57,498
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

999
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,600
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

1000
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:02,303
You can't get... Well, why
don't you... Stop, stop, wait...

1001
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:05,408
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

1002
01:20:10,981 --> 01:20:12,246
Can I?

1003
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:14,518
His memory cells are fried.

1004
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:16,652
Finish him.

1005
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:28,095
<i>We will fight on. Regroup,
rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

1006
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:30,698
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

1007
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,301
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

1008
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:35,003
<i>Once we've gathered
the others, we'll join you.</i>

1009
01:20:35,005 --> 01:20:37,204
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

1010
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:42,778
<i>If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.</i>

1011
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,047
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

1012
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,450
<i>I am coming.</i>

1013
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:51,752
Prime is coming here?

1014
01:20:51,754 --> 01:20:53,955
They're all coming here.

1015
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:58,193
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

1016
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:01,830
We'll burn the whole
planet to cinders.

1017
01:21:01,832 --> 01:21:04,231
We must get word
to Cybertron immediately.

1018
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,366
<i>This is Burns.</i>

1019
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:08,070
Tell them to bring an army.

1020
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,471
Burns, we made
a terrible mistake.

1021
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:11,572
Powell?

1022
01:21:11,574 --> 01:21:14,408
And thanks to
our human allies,

1023
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,912
I know just how to get
the message home.

1024
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,213
They're using our satellites.

1025
01:21:19,215 --> 01:21:20,782
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

1026
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:23,051
They're gonna kill us all.

1027
01:21:23,053 --> 01:21:28,023
Thank you for your
hospitality, friend Powell.

1028
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:29,593
He's all yours.

1029
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,159
- No.
- <i>Powell?</i>

1030
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,695
- <i>You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

1031
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:39,600
Where's the Krazy Glue?

1032
01:21:39,602 --> 01:21:42,238
What, did she cut
the wire to the TV?

1033
01:21:42,672 --> 01:21:44,206
Ron.

1034
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,608
Charlie!

1035
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,676
Charlie!

1036
01:21:47,678 --> 01:21:51,181
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

1037
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:54,616
Where is
your sister?

1038
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,953
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

1039
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,790
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

1040
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:02,826
What?

1041
01:22:07,097 --> 01:22:08,530
Charlie has fallen ill

1042
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:11,400
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

1043
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:13,935
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

1044
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,105
Are you on drugs? Hmm?

1045
01:22:16,107 --> 01:22:17,539
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

1046
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,341
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

1047
01:22:19,343 --> 01:22:21,443
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

1048
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:23,547
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

1049
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:30,754
Where is she?

1050
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:33,290
Uh...

1051
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:35,759
Otis?

1052
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:40,929
I found a tower
to transmit our message.

1053
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:42,964
It's close.

1054
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:47,669
Oh. B-127.
I almost forgot.

1055
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,970
I didn't.

1056
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,710
No! Don't shoot!

1057
01:22:54,712 --> 01:22:56,011
No!

1058
01:23:11,562 --> 01:23:12,696
Bee!

1059
01:23:15,132 --> 01:23:16,667
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

1060
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:25,942
I can fix this.
I can fix this.

1061
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:31,180
Charlie.

1062
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:34,649
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

1063
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:35,652
Please.

1064
01:23:37,488 --> 01:23:39,356
Charlie, we got to go.

1065
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,161
- The gun.
- What?

1066
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:46,731
The electric gun. Get it.

1067
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,501
I can fix you.

1068
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:54,336
Come on, Bee.

1069
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:55,839
Come back to me.

1070
01:24:02,012 --> 01:24:03,814
Come on, give me
the other one.

1071
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:11,790
Bee, come on.

1072
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,693
I can't lose you, too, Bee.

1073
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:17,528
Please, Bee!

1074
01:24:31,742 --> 01:24:32,744
I'm sorry.

1075
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:48,026
Oh.

1076
01:24:57,735 --> 01:24:59,569
Oh, my God.

1077
01:24:59,571 --> 01:25:01,773
Come on, Bee, we've got
to get you out of here.

1078
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:17,220
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

1079
01:25:17,222 --> 01:25:19,521
We got to move, now.

1080
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:21,659
Come on, Bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

1081
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:24,529
There's a door in my way.

1082
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:27,997
They've got bombs!

1083
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,767
- We got to go.
- Bee, come on.

1084
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:32,668
Charlie!

1085
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,038
You've gotta get up, come on.

1086
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:36,538
- Three.
- Charlie!

1087
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,274
- Two.
- Come on.

1088
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:39,374
One.

1089
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:40,711
- Charlie!
- Come on.

1090
01:25:57,762 --> 01:25:58,963
Memo?

1091
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,301
Memo. Memo, wake up.

1092
01:26:06,905 --> 01:26:08,173
Easy.

1093
01:26:11,277 --> 01:26:12,477
Easy.

1094
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,380
Hold your fire!

1095
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:18,116
Get the kid out of here.

1096
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:22,618
Memo! Wake up, Memo!

1097
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:23,886
Come on, kid.

1098
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,056
Hey! No!

1099
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:26,958
Bee!

1100
01:26:27,191 --> 01:26:28,291
Run!

1101
01:26:30,427 --> 01:26:31,628
Bee!

1102
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:34,064
Run!

1103
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:36,035
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

1104
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:41,139
- Take it down!
- No, stop!

1105
01:26:42,674 --> 01:26:45,474
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

1106
01:26:45,476 --> 01:26:47,777
Strip it down to parts!

1107
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:50,513
Leave him alone!
You don't understand.

1108
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:53,481
Fight back, Bee!

1109
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:55,919
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

1110
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:58,454
He's more human
than you'll ever be!

1111
01:26:58,456 --> 01:27:00,556
That is enough!

1112
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:24,815
Oh, shit.

1113
01:27:36,027 --> 01:27:37,061
Open fire!

1114
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:52,177
Fall back! Take cover!

1115
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:08,827
Bee!

1116
01:28:11,363 --> 01:28:12,698
Bee!

1117
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,567
Bee, stop!

1118
01:28:36,121 --> 01:28:38,955
You remember, don't you?

1119
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:44,997
They're coming back.

1120
01:28:50,302 --> 01:28:51,669
Oh, God.

1121
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:53,638
Are you okay?

1122
01:28:54,273 --> 01:28:56,840
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1123
01:28:56,842 --> 01:28:58,811
We need to get out of here.

1124
