Yeah, you're like me, Tommy,

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
you can't bear to watch a fight
which has got rules.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Tommy, right, imagine...

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Imagine that you could not see...

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,200
at all, you was born blind.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Then one day you open up your eyes

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
and you can see everything

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,600
in the world.

The revelation.

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
Innit?

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
I've had one.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Yeah, saw a beautiful house
down in Margate.

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Great big white building...

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Beautiful. A piece of heaven.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Actually, you see, the way the Earth,
it curves, I thought to myself,

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
"Alfie, what are you doing?

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
What are you doing?

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
Why don't you just sell
every ounce of gold and sell

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,720
every barrel of rum you got and just
buy yourself some time, mate?"

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
I need to buy myself some time.

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,240
You're moving to Margate?

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
I am actually, yeah.
I need to get myself some rest.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,320
I need some rest.

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Plus, the Americans are here now,
aren't they?

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
So, that's it.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,920
Yeah. It's been that way ever since
the war, innit? The Americans.

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,640
And there is a fight going on,
out there, between big and small.

53
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,400
Big will fuck small.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Right. Margate then. Blue skies, heaven.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,720
I will see you, Tommy.

56

No, you're all right.

Bonnie! Are you okay?

182
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,080
I'll give you two to one
now on the Cockney.

183
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,640
[crowd clamoring]

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,640
Right.

185

[exhales]

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,200
[man] That's it. One, two. One, two!

[crowd cheering]

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Come on, Bonnie boy!

189
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,920
Bonnie, come on, kill him!

190
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
[indistinct shouting]

191
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
Come on!

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
Where are Tommy and Arthur?

193
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,080
[man] Punch him!

194
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,080
I don't know.

195
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,200
Come on, Bonnie!

196
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,240
Come on!

197
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360

198
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
[breathing heavily]

199
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Arthur!

[choking]

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240

205
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,800
Arthur!

[inaudible]

209
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,760
[referee] I declare Bonnie Gold the new
welterweight champion...

210
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,560
of the Midlands South...

211
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Yes!

212
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,120
Yes! Bonnie!

213
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,400
Tommy, what's happened? Arthur's dead.

214
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,280
[panting] He's dead.

215
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240

216
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
[crowd cheering]

217
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,480
Tommy, we have the other wop.

218
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,640
Cunt had a wire in his pocket.

219
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,839
[grunting]

220
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Go on, Finn! Go on, Finn!

[groaning]

222
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,440
Take his eyes, Finn.

223
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
Do it for Arthur.

224
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,480
Take his fucking eyes!

225
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,960
No. No!

226
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,080
[man screaming]

227
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
Close the doors!

228
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
No one fucking leaves!

229
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,640
[gunshots]

230
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,400
My brother is dead.

231
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
You hear me!

232
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,200
My brother is dead!

233
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,680
[panting]

234
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,320
-Tommy.

[telephone rings]

238
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Hello, Michael.

239
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,440
There's been a change of plan. <i>Mr. Gold will come and get you.</i>

240
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,080
Arthur's dead.

241
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
[door closes]

242
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
[sighs] Tommy, I've been trying
to think of words...

243
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Don't.

244
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,200
Words don't work.

245
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,960
Michael, we're in a grave situation.

246
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,960
Tommy has a plan.

247
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,160
Instead of going to Australia,

248
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
you're going to New York.

249
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,040
Why?

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,760
'Cause the company has business
to attend to in America.

251
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
Will I be coming back?

252
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,120
Train leaves in an hour, Michael.

253
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,520
You made a choice.

254
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,160
You knew I was gonna be shot

255
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
and you chose not to tell me.

256
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,200
I chose my mum.

257
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,200
When all this business is over,

258
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,320
we'll all be free to make our own choices.

259
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,040
So is that it?

260
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,280
You get the train to Liverpool,
then the <i>SS Monroe. </i>[clears throat]

261
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,200
Boat sails tomorrow.

262
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Now you can go.

263
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
[exhales]

264
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,200
I need an overseas connection, please.

265
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,520
USA.

266
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,920
[breathes deeply]

267
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,840
-[man] Tommy!
-It's all right, let her come.

268
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,000
Please.

269
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Once we're all finished.

270
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
[lighter clicks]

271
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
[fire burning]

272
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,160
[Audrey] <i>Your note talked about </i>
<i>making terms for peace.</i>

273
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,560
But my son says there are no terms.

274
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,400
You took my husband and my son.

275
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,520
We took two of your brothers.

276
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,360
The vendetta is done.

277
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,280
We say the vendetta is won.

278
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,760
We will take everything you have.

279
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,160
All your businesses,

280
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
signed over to us.

281
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,840
You agree to this

282
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,800
or my son will kill you all,

283
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
one by one.

284
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,240
The vendetta is won.

285
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,000
That's it.

286
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,560
No more killing.

287
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Who do you think you were, Mr. Shelby?

288
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,960
[banging]

289
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
[door unlocks]

290
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,800
Why don't you let him know
we're here to buy his business?

291
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Mr. Solomons!

292
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Mr. Changretta's here to see you!

293
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,160
<i>Andiamo.</i>

294
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
My Peaky!

295
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
[speaking Italian]

296
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,600
They say he was a captain.

297
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Oh, yeah?

298
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,800
Then you might wanna tell them
not to open that fucking door.

299
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
[speaking Italian]

300
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,880
[Luca speaking English]
Seems Mr. Solomons already left town.

301
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,480
So all this is mine.

302
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,320
[laughing]

303
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
Huh.

304
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,440
[door opens]

305
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
[Tommy] You don't knock?

306
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,680
[Lizzie] You don't know my new address?

307
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,200
Hello, Lizzie, how are you? I know your new address, Lizzie,

308
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,560
because it was me who bought you
the new fucking house.

309
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
Then why don't you visit it?

310
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
[drawer opens]

311
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
[drawer closes]

312
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,640
Yeah, I've been busy. Busy doing what?

313
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,240
Preparing for tomorrow.

314
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,320
Why, what's tomorrow?

315
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,960
Luca Changretta is coming to Birmingham.
It's our turn.

316
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,680
He's already taken over
Alfie Solomons, Sabini,

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Titanics... All of them.

318
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,480
And now he's coming to take control
of Shelby Company Limited.

319
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,040
What are we going to do about that?

320
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,320
We're gonna let him have it.

321
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,440
[footsteps approaching]

322
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,120
[speaking Italian]

323
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,960
All that's left of the Peaky
fucking Blinders.

324
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,000
[snaps]

325
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,840
I've had my lawyer draw up these papers.

326
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,840
Cover every enterprise in your possession.

327
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,320
Bars, restaurants, warehouses.

328
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,240
Every fucking thing that you've taken
all these years to gather together.

329
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,440
You will sign them all over...

330
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,320
to my family

331
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,840
or you're gonna die.

332
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,880
Right here.

333
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
I would've buried you all, but my mother, she, uh...

334
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,680
She knows you. She said,

335
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,920
it'll be worse for you
if I let you live...

336
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,680
and take away everything that you have.

337
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,160
Search them.

338
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Especially don't trust this bitch.

339
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,840
So...

340
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,480
Sign.

341
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,760
Every fucking one of them.

342
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,360
You can sign them on your knees.

343
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,240
On the floor.

344
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,400
[papers falling]

345
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,880
Get on your fucking knees and sign.

346
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,200
A friend of mine once said...

347
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
[exhales deeply]

348
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,040
"Big fucks small."

349
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
So I had to find someone bigger than you.

350
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,520
Now, you may know
there are two families in Brooklyn,

351
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,640
who want to take over your monopoly

352
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,680
on the import of liquor into New York.

353
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,160
[Polly] But if they move
against you in New York,

354
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,440
they'll start a war between the families.

355
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,960
[Tommy] But if you were to die
in a vendetta

356
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
with some fucking bookmaker in Birmingham,

357
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,920
they could take over your business
without a war.

358
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,200
We also contacted
a businessman in Chicago.

359
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,320
He's also interested in moving
into the liquor business in New York.

360
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,240
His name is Alphonse Capone.

361
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,400
You been talking to that fat fuck? You see, all the blood relatives
you brought with you

362
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,680
from New York, they're all dead,
Mr. Changretta.

363
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,440
And these men here,

364
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,920
they work for money,
for the highest bidder.

365
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
They now have new orders.

366
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
[Luca] Is that right?

367
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
Is that right?

368
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
And you, Matteo?

369
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Hey...

370
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,600
Very fucking...

371
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,880
[grunting]

372
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
[grunting]

373
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,400
[gasps]

374
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,000
[Tommy] <i>Arthur's been injured,</i>
<i>but he's all right, Poll.</i>

375
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,239
<i>We need to make them believe</i>
<i>that he's dead.</i>

376
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,760
<i>To everyone but you, me, and Linda,</i>

377
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,760
<i>Arthur Shelby is dead.</i>

378
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
<i>I've got it all worked out.</i>

379
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,080
<i>We can use his death to win this war.</i>

380
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,520
[thuds]

381
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,080
[exhales deeply]
Tell your people in Chicago

382
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,360
that Michael Gray will sign
the import license to New York.

383
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,480
Three hundred barrels
of English dry gin a month.

384
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,160
Leave.

385
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
All of ya.

386
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,200
Tell your boss what you saw here today.

387
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
And tell him...

388
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,640
You don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

389
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,360
[slow music playing]

390
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,200
[indistinct chatter]

391
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,160
[Tommy] Nice. Hey!

392
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,760
[clears throat] Listen up. Um...

393
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,680
Before we go and eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

394
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,520
Last time we were all here,

395
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
it ended badly.

396
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,560
Yeah.

397
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,880
And now, we're in a happier place.

398
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,960
That's it. I'd just like to raise a toast.

399
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,440
[Arthur] Hold on.

400
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,240
A few words I want to say from the heart,

401
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,960
and this time,

402
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,080
you're gonna let me finish, Tommy.

403
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,240
Now, as you all know,

404
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,080
Arthur Shelby is dead.

405
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
'Cause of that,

406
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,280
Tommy's offered me a way out.

407
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
A new identity.

408
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Start a whole new life for meself.

409
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,240
I've thought about it.

410
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,080
Made a decision.

411
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
I ain't fucking going nowhere.

412
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
[all laughing]

413
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,560
Our enemies are gone.

414
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,400
Dead, all of them.

415
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,400
For the first time since me,

416
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
my two kid brothers,

417
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,600
Tommy and John,

418
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,840
enlisted in the Warwickshire Yeomanry,

419
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,640
we have peace.

420
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,840
So...

421
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,120
I think I'd like to make a proposal

422
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,520
that all of you,
the Shelby Company Limited,

423
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,400
insist that Tommy here

424
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,960
take some time off.

425
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,280
Time you took a holiday, Tom.

426
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Put your feet up.

427
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
War's over.

428
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
No one wants to kill us.

429
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,120
To peace.

430
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,960
[all] To peace.

431
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,960
[glasses clinking]

432
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,480
I do hope you're gonna leave the dog
out of this.

433
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,240
You were easy to find.

434
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
Yeah, well, there's a good reason
for that, Tommy.

435
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,000
Because I wanted it to be here.

436
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
I once told you, Alfie,

437
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,760
that for business reasons or in bad blood,

438
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I would kill you.

439
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,320
I have no business reasons.

440
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,320
It seems you have retired.

441
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,440
So, this is all purely for bad blood,
is it, Tommy?

442
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,200
-Yeah.
-Right. Yeah.

443
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
Told you.

444
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
I wanted it to be here.

445
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,240
-You gonna look after this dog?
-No.

446
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,600
Right then. Well, his name is Cyril and he'll be very upset and distressed,

447
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,320
so you'll need to find him someone.

448
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,480
-You're not armed?
-No.

449
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,360
Don't be dull.

450
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,840
The only thing I got on me

451
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,520
is fucking cancer, mate.

452
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
Yeah.

453
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,640
Riddled with it.

454
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,000
Doctor told me I might have picked it up
in France from the gas or something.

455
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,480
He even showed me a photograph...

456
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,240
Alfie, stop talking.

457
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,760
So I said, "Margate" right, and here I am.

458
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,680
-Come on, Tommy.
-Alfie, look at me.

459
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
There's an honorable reason now
to pull that trigger...

460
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,760
Alfie, look at me.

461
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,120
Fucking get on with it.
Stop acting like a little girl.

462
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,120
Alfie!

463
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,960
[gunshots]

464
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
[somber music playing]

465
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,120
[music continues]

466
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,000
-[horses approaching]
-[explosion]

467
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,800
-[gunshots]
-[dogs barking]

468
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,600
[men shouting]

469
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,000
[dogs barking]

470
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,040
[sighs]

471
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,880
[grunts]

472
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,320
[Frances, muffled] Mr. Shelby. Mr. Shelby.

473
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,080
[clear] Mr. Shelby.

474
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,880
Mr. Shelby, you are not yourself.
I should call a doctor.

475
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,640
It's all right, Frances.

476
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,600
I'll call Mrs. Gray.

477
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,200
I know what this is...

478
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,440
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

479
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,040
[uncorking bottle]

480
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,080
[pouring drink] Out. Thank you.

481
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,760
[music continues]

482
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,040
[glass shatters]

483
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,720
Charlie.

484
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,800
[clears throat]

485
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,480
Since I know you won't go yourself,

486
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,360
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.

487
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
No, it's all right.
None of the boys know you're sick.

488
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm not sick, Polly.

489
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,520
It starts when you stop, when you rest.

490
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,360
Could be nerves.

491
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,280
The war.

492
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,520
It might be the alcohol.
Blue devils, they call that.

493
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,680
Yeah, well. Yeah.

494
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,440
Yeah, it's the fucking booze.

495
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,480
It's the booze, the booze got out
and the booze got in me bones.

496
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,680
Lizzie wants to see you.

497
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,840
No.

498
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,520
Tom, she's showing.

499
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,280
I don't want to see Lizzie, Poll.

500
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,440
Shit. Maybe it's in us.

501
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,000
It's with Shelbys.

502
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,240
It's in our Gypsy blood.

503
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,600
We live somewhere between life and death,

504
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,000
waiting to move on.

505
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,040
And in the end,

506
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,640
we accept it.

507
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,160
We shake hands with devils

508
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,000
and we walk past them.

509
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,400
[sighs]

510
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,080
Mr. Shelby, you're meant to be resting.

511
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,760
I've learned something, Frances.

512
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,200
There's no rest for me in this world.

513
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,720
Perhaps in the next.

514
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,080
Them there, you pay out.
This one, you have to think.

515
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,640
Use your fucking head, man.

516
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,160
Right, even money.

517
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,680
Whose fucking idea was it
that I go on holiday, eh?

518
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,040
Welcome back, Tommy. How was it?
What'd you get up to?

519
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,520
Went fishing, played golf.

520
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,960
Golf's fucking boring.

521
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,120
Boring and easy.

522
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,720
Yeah, well, what's the plan?

523
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,960
[Tommy] <i>I need you</i>
<i>to give this to Jessie Eden.</i>

524
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,800
<i>By hand.</i>

525
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,640
-Yes, Mr. Shelby.
-By your hand.

526
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,800
This will be the last job
you'll do for me.

527
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,120
You can go to Glasgow
and be with your family.

528
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,760
You're free.

529
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,960
You need to sign all of these.

530
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,360
So you shook hands with the devil?

531
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,920
Yeah.

532
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,840
And I walked past him.

533
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,840
Poll...

534
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,160
I've had an idea.

535
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,760
Oh, fuck.

536
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,120
[Tommy] <i>"Dear Jessie,</i>
<i>now, more certainly than ever,</i>

537
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,440
<i>I believe things must change.</i>
<i>Things must change.</i>

538
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
<i>The general strike is holding.</i>

539
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,840
<i>We've not an hour to lose.</i>

540
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,560
<i>Meet me."</i>

541
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,080
[Tommy] <i>I've made up my mind, Jessie.</i>
[Jessie] <i>About what?</i>

542
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,320
Your cause is now my cause.

543
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,520
I wanna help.

544
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,360
The strike is holding. I want to meet
the people who can take this further.

545
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,720
Are you serious?

546
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,200
Yeah.

547
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,240
I've done a lot of thinking.

548
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,520
Right. I'll arrange a meeting.

549
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,040
The operator knows my voice.

550
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,560
Give me the name and the number.

551
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,600
His name is Casey Douglas.

552
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,600
It's Sparkhill 453.

553
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,600
Right.

554
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,840
And he's the leader of the cell?

555
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,520
He's in contact with London and Moscow.

556
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,360
Good.

557
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,640
Yeah. Sparkhill 453.

558
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,840
[exhales deeply]

559
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,760
[Bigge] <i>You are quite a creature,</i>
<i>Mr. Shelby.</i>

560
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,200
<i>When I received your note,</i>
<i>I wasn't sure you could deliver.</i>

561
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,720
I've made contact

562
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,200
with a Soviet agent inside
the Birmingham Communist Party.

563
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,280
And do you have a name?

564
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,920
And an address and a telephone number.

565
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,120
I can be of great use to you.

566
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,600
I can give you the name
of any communist party member,

567
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,000
who is prepared to cross the line
into armed revolution.

568
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,120
We're in the fourth day
of a general strike,

569
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,480
which appears to be holding.

570
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,480
Even if it fails today,

571
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,200
tomorrow they may succeed.

572
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,520
Mmm. [sniffs]

573
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,680
And you're offering to help ensure
they never succeed.

574
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,760
If my cover is maintained,

575
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,440
I can begin to shape the movement
and organize it myself.

576
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,760
And undermine it?

577
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,440
Rise through the ranks of the wider
Socialist movements.

578
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,720
Of course you want something in return.

579
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,960
What this time? A knighthood?

580
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,520
My proposal.

581
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,680
And my conditions.

582
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,000
Mmm. For the attention
of Winston Churchill?

583
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,240
He holds me in very high regard.

584
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,560
Are you serious?

585
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,720
Breaking up a revolutionary cell
is one thing.

586
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,280
Given my position of influence
in my home city,

587
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,000
I could be of much more use
to you than that.

588
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,560

589
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,360

596
