1
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,527
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,364
- Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,177
Hmm?

5
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:04,641
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

6
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,935
It can't be.

7
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,102
Tai Lung.

8
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,855
I have returned to
take what is mine.

9
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:14,151
Which is everything
that is yours.

10
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,622
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

11
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:30,792
and no one will
stand in his way.

12
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:34,797
Not even the great
Dragon Warrior.

13
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,765
Oh, where is Po?

14
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,518
He was supposed
to be here hours ago.

15
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,521
Ping, will you
please just relax?

16
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,481
I am relaxed!

17
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:56,192
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

18
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,778
But what if he's sick?
What if he's hurt?

19
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,405
What if he's hungry?

20
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,156
Don't get your
noodles in a twist.

21
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:06,704
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

22
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,211
Kung fu!

23
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,506
Whoa! That's bad.

24
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,384
Whoa! Getting worse.

25
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,802
Whoa!

26
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,639
Ah, come on!

27
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:44,825
Ha-ha!

28
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,541
Okay, big guy. We're really
gonna have to wrap this up.

29
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:06,639
Whee!

30
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,140
- Oink.
- Oink.

31
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,225
Again, again!

32
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:12,143
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

33
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:16,981
And next time, keep
your surf off their turf.

34
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,990
I'm late. I'm late.
Ooh, I'm late.

35
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,409
- The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

36
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,037
Was, is and always will be.

37
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,914
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

38
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,541
And I love you too, adoring fan.

39
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,125
- Sign my scroll.
- Sign my hat.

40
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,293
- Sign my shirt.
- Okay, okay.

41
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:38,712
I'll sign whatever you want.

42
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,589
Po!

43
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,715
Master Shifu!

44
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,343
Here, let me just...

45
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,805
There, that's much... worse.

46
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,139
We have to talk.

47
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,017
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

48
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,103
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

49
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,397
What ceremony?

50
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,857
- The Staff of Wisdom.
- Ooh.

51
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,651
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
- Aah.

52
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,820
It is said that whoever
possesses this staff

53
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,781
has the power to travel
between the realms.

54
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,701
The power to unlock the
door to the Spirit Realm.

55
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,120
And now, the power to open...

56
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:16,917
the all-new Dragon
Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

57
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,048
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

58
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,553
Dragon Warrior!

59
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,680
Will the Furious
Five be here too?

60
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,056
Unfortunately, no.

61
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:34,726
They're off on super
cool kung fu missions.

62
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,187
Tigress is taking on the
free-range chicken gang.

63
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:39,397
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

64
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:41,232
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

65
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,609
- Crane!
<i>- Long story.</i>

66
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,486
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

67
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,447
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

68
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,739
<i>And Mantis?</i>

69
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,784
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

70
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,412
Just 'cause they're
not here in person

71
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:57,081
doesn't mean they're not
here as life-sized cut-outs.

72
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:00,168
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

73
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,962
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

74
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,631
My turn! My turn!

75
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,716
And then you.

76
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,556
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

77
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,767
We need to talk.

78
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,435
Now.

79
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,521
Hey, can I get one of
those in a wallet size?

80
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,856
- Po!
- Coming.

81
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,320
Do you remember the first time you
climbed these steps to the Jade Palace?

82
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,114
How could I forget? I thought
I'd never make it to the top.

83
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,616
Yes, but you persevered.

84
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:35,870
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

85
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,789
The next step? What
are you talking about?

86
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,166
I've already taken all
the steps. Haven't I?

87
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,961
It is time for you to
choose your successor.

88
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,379
Successor for what?

89
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,799
A successor to be the
next Dragon Warrior.

90
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,759
Oh... Yeah, I get it.

91
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,179
Funny, 'cause I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

92
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:56,891
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

93
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,644
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

94
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,604
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

95
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,273
Once a successor is chosen,

96
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,401
you will advance to the
highest level in all of kung fu.

97
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,488
Spiritual Leader of
the Valley of Peace.

98
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,866
Whoa.

99
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,325
I don't know what that means.

100
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,744
It's just like Master
Oogway before you.

101
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:21,374
You will oversee the Valley, passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope.

102
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,626
Look, I appreciate
the promotion.

103
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:27,255
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

104
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,174
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

105
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,342
A cookie.

106
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,635
Other hand.

107
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,345
The Staff of Wisdom.

108
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,347
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

109
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,683
Do you really think it was so
you could open a restaurant?

110
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,934
Or pose for pictures?

111
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,686
He wasn't super specific.

112
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:45,982
Oogway entrusted you with that
staff so you could follow in his footsteps

113
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,943
and become something
better than you already are.

114
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,196
You take it.

115
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,822
No. Oogway did
not give it to me.

116
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:56,284
Being the next Oogway is not
my destiny, which I have accepted

117
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,577
and am at peace with.

118
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,621
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

119
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,248
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

120
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,416
This is an honor.

121
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,545
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

122
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,340
Master Shifu, I finally
found something I'm good at,

123
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,133
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

124
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,302
No one is taking
anything away, Po.

125
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,846
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

126
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,599
Yeah, but where's the
"skadoosh"? You know what I mean?

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,351
The "shasha-booie"?

128
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,852
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

129
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,522
but I don't know anything about
passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

130
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,565
All I know are two things.

131
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,902
Kicking butt and taking names.

132
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,988
And if I'm being completely honest, I'm
not even that good at the name-taking.

133
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,156
Like, who was that
fire-breathing crocodile?

134
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,659
I wanna say Steve...

135
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,993
You were chosen to
bring peace to the Valley,

136
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:44,332
and there are other ways to bring
peace than simply kicking butt.

137
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,501
Well, sure. But
not any fun ones.

138
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,837
Please. Being the Dragon
Warrior is all I know.

139
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,006
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

140
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,175
The Valley of Peace
needs a Spiritual Leader,

141
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,052
and Master Oogway chose you.

142
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,013
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

143
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,517
Candidates? What candidates?

144
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,737
Awesome!

145
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,162
No way!

146
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:26,834
Wow!

147
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,877
Skadoosh.

148
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,296
Fantastic pose.

149
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,683
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

150
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:49,190
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

151
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,068
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

152
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,073
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

153
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,201
So many great candidates.

154
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,204
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

155
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,372
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

156
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,250
What is happening?

157
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,587
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

158
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,136
Like it or not, Po, you
have to choose a successor.

159
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:24,098
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

160
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,808
You will know when you know.

161
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,604
How do I know when
I know? You know?

162
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,067
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

163
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,318
Just as Oogway did before me.

164
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,363
I'm not conflicted. I'm just
not ready for a next step.

165
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,572
What is that you're holding?

166
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,032
The Staff of Wisdom?

167
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,116
Other hand.

168
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,701
A chewed-up peach pit?

169
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,161
Exactly.

170
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:49,541
Every pit holds the
promise of a mighty tree.

171
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,793
Uh, how is this gonna
help me find the answers?

172
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,963
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

173
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,633
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

174
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,970
There we go.

175
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,597
All right, universe.

176
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,267
Give me some guidance.

177
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,478
<i>Inner peace.</i>

178
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,730
<i>Inner peace.</i>

179
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:13,774
<i>Inner peace.</i>

180
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,609
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

181
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,653
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

182
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,821
<i>Snow peas?</i>

183
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,074
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,493
Inner peace.

185
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,370
Inner peace.

186
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,540
This is not working at all.

187
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,208
Maybe focus on your breathing?

188
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,961
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

189
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,797
Technically, you're talking
to you, if you think about it.

190
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,550
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

191
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,886
Wait, if I'm Po's inner
voice, then who are you?

192
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,929
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

193
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,514
How many voices
do I have in there?

194
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,683
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

195
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,351
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

196
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:53,232
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

197
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,276
Anyone want a cookie?

198
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,742
Universe?

199
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,287
Is that you?

200
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,140
Attention, mysterious figure!

201
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,436
The Dragon Warrior's
here to perform justice.

202
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:38,191
I know you're in here.

203
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,819
Just a matter of
time before I find you.

204
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:43,447
Ooh.

205
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,542
You can't hide
from justice forever.

206
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,048
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

207
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,009
You've got excellent
taste, I'll give you that.

208
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,344
But I can't give you
that. Give it back.

209
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,097
If you insist.

210
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,234
Oh, no!

211
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,529
He's got a walking stick. What are
you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

212
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,157
This stick is not for the
strolling. It's the Staff of Wisdom.

213
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,827
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

214
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,746
I am the Dragon Warrior.

215
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,209
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing
about you says "dragon" or "warrior."

216
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,388
Whoa.

217
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,016
Hi-yah!

218
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,144
How dare you desecrate
the Hall of Heroes?

219
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,687
Who's desecrating what now?

220
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,480
Master Ostrich's Egg!

221
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:02,192
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

222
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,569
The Indestructible Chain
Hammer of Master Pangolin.

223
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,821
Whoopsies.

224
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,327
Ha-ha! Oh!

225
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,043
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

226
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,588
Which I've already
broken! Twice!

227
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,759
Why would you keep an urn
of souls? Feels kinda creepy.

228
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,597
Are you doing okay there, big
guy? You're looking a little tired.

229
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,475
I've never felt more awake!

230
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,021
The War Hammer
of Master Chipmunk?

231
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:43,943
You're gonna pay for that.

232
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,613
Hello?

233
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,625
You faker.

234
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,711
It's not faking.
It's called Method.

235
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,005
Catch ya later, panda.

236
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,840
No.

237
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,057
I think I'll catch you now.

238
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:21,856
Whoa!

239
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:29,697
Whoa!

240
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,116
Whoa!

241
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:36,704
Told ya.

242
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,831
You got me, oh-great-and-powerful
Dumpling Warrior.

243
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,792
That's Dragon Warrior...

244
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,335
Let go of me.

245
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,670
Just tell me one thing.

246
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,089
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

247
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,383
That's a mystery for you to
solve during your two-year stay

248
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,801
at the Valley of Peace prison.

249
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,762
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

250
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,515
It is a day care
on the weekends.

251
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,725
But it's also a prison.

252
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,934
There he is!

253
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:00,977
Dragon Warrior!

254
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,979
- Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

255
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,149
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

256
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,735
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

257
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,613
He said that he's not gonna
stop until the Valley of Peace falls

258
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,948
and the Dragon
Warrior bows before him.

259
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,118
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

260
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:20,163
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

261
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,165
Well, you know what they say...

262
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:27,004
every step leaves a
footprint, no matter how small.

263
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:51,195
Every step leaves a
footprint, no matter how small.

264
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,618
Very clever, fox.
You know something.

265
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,788
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

266
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,164
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

267
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:04,832
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

268
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,042
I mean, what's in it for me?

269
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,127
The peace of mind knowing
you did the right thing.

270
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,672
You're adorable. Has
anyone ever told you that?

271
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,465
And I don't mean just
in, like, the cuddly sense.

272
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,758
I don't have time for games.

273
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,927
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

274
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:20,098
Maybe. Or maybe she wants
you to think it was Tai Lung.

275
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,349
Wait. She?

276
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,643
Mine!

277
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,688
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

278
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,980
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

279
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,107
<i>The master of deception.</i>

280
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,484
<i>The lizard of lies with
the glowing teal eyes.</i>

281
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,695
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

282
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,447
The Chameleon.

283
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,702
This is kind of a
private conversation.

284
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,453
Who's The Chameleon?

285
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,831
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

286
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,293
So she shape-shifted
into Tai Lung.

287
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,961
But what does she have against
me and the Valley of Peace?

288
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,130
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

289
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:56,050
You're right. How do I
find this "The Chameleon"?

290
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:57,719
She isn't someone
who can be found.

291
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,513
At least not without
someone in the know.

292
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,391
And how do I find
someone "in the know"?

293
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:06,477
Oh! It's me. It's
obviously... It's me.

294
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,770
I'm in the know.

295
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,316
Forget it. I'll find
her on my own.

296
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,941
Good luck.

297
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:15,111
After all, how hard can it be to find
someone who can look like anyone,

298
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:16,405
blend in anywhere?

299
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,368
Fine. You lead me
to The Chameleon,

300
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,746
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

301
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,040
Deal.

302
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,249
Po!

303
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,542
What do you think you're doing?

304
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,004
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and...

305
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,089
That's a job for
the Furious Five.

306
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,134
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

307
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,011
Look, I know that
change is difficult

308
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,555
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

309
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,016
but your job is
finding a successor.

310
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,478
The Dragon Warrior and I have a
deal. Mind your own business, squirrel.

311
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,188
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

312
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm a red panda.

313
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:54,567
You know what?
I love that for you.

314
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,194
Po, this is your decision.

315
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,658
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

316
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,413
- Thanks for the free stay.
- What are you doing?

317
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,831
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

318
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,375
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

319
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,459
You can't leave.

320
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,712
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

321
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,924
You are supposed to be passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope!

322
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,677
Just think of it as one last
Dragon Warrior adventure.

323
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,054
I'll be back soon. Tell
my dads I love 'em.

324
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,391
I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

325
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:31,437
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

326
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,106
That's a good back scratcher.

327
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,440
- Yoink!
- Hey!

328
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,693
So, does this really unlock
the door to the Spirit Realm?

329
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,319
It doesn't work like that.

330
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,114
It has to be given in
order to gain its powers.

331
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,075
Gotcha. Given to
gain. So, can I have it?

332
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,827
No! What do you take me for?

333
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:46,911
An easy mark.

334
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:47,996
What's an easy mark?

335
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,664
Someone who's
easy to steal from,

336
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,875
usually because they're
generous and too trusting.

337
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,044
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

338
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,758
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

339
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,886
and her favorite food is panda.

340
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,681
They say this Chameleon
character has magical powers.

341
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:10,436
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

342
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,899
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

343
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,401
Or you.

344
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,989
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

345
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,783
Po's going to take
down an evil sorceress?

346
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,744
The... The Chameleon?

347
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,080
Well, a Dragon Warrior's
work is never done.

348
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,334
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming
up with a convicted felon

349
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:38,213
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

350
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:43,176
Relax. Po has faced demons,
demigods, and everything else in between.

351
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,385
He's always come out on top.

352
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,596
You're right. You're right.

353
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,473
But what if you're wrong?

354
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,225
Calm down, Ping.

355
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,229
How bad can one
evil sorceress be?

356
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,649
Who is she to summon us?

357
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,900
Classic power move.

358
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,278
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

359
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,907
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

360
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,617
You left out the
evil sorceress part.

361
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,494
We used to run this city.

362
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,080
Now we pay her half
the money we swindle.

363
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,666
It's like a criminal can't make
an honest living anymore.

364
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,168
Yeah, but what could we do?

365
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,379
Together, we can take her down.

366
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,298
Are you nuts?
She's a shape-shifter.

367
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,303
She could be at this very
table, and we'd have no idea.

368
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:30,181
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

369
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:32,100
Or you're The Chameleon.

370
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,852
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

371
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,229
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

372
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,522
I'm The Chameleon.

373
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:38,732
I said don't say it.

374
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:48,157
We obviously spoke out of turn.

375
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:49,242
Sorry, Chameleon.

376
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,119
No, no. Don't apologize.

377
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,623
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

378
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:59,377
so it doesn't feel good when
you're the one being squeezed.

379
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,046
Especially when the
one doing the squeezing

380
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,550
is just a "bug-eyed,
power-hungry"...

381
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,135
What was the rest?

382
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,053
Reptilian runt.

383
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:13,224
Well, this "reptilian
runt" wants more.

384
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,268
You already have the city.

385
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,228
What else could
you possibly want?

386
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:21,316
I have something special in
mind. I'm very close to achieving it.

387
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:24,110
As close as the blood moon.

388
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,778
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

389
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,406
So little time, so
many expenses.

390
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:33,828
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

391
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:34,955
No.

392
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,337
What was that now?

393
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,423
I mean no disrespect.

394
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,717
Don't worry.

395
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:53,681
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

396
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:59,104
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

397
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,981
But I never forget.

398
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,275
You might say I
have the memory...

399
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:05,485
Oh, don't say it.

400
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,613
Of an elephant.

401
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,631
You think I've
pushed you too far?

402
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:30,802
Then you, my friend,
can't begin to fathom

403
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:34,640
just how far I can push.

404
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:43,732
I'll expect your
tributes by dawn.

405
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,696
Are we gonna
stop for lunch soon?

406
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,781
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

407
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:54,659
But it does take the occasional
time-out for snackage.

408
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,452
Wanna split my almond cookie?

409
00:23:56,453 --> 00:24:00,039
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

410
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,417
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

411
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,377
The "bam-what-le"?

412
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:05,420
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

413
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,006
Do you want the cookie or not?

414
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,469
I got my eye on you.

415
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,973
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

416
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,183
Just a little farther.

417
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:36,618
Li! What are you doing out
here in the middle of the night?

418
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,288
Well, I... I... I... didn't wanna
miss the blood moon rising.

419
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,041
Oh, pooh. You are
just as worried as I am.

420
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,459
All right, all right.

421
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,295
I know pandas come across
as calm, gentle and chill,

422
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,631
but... the truth is

423
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,216
I'm kinda freaking out!

424
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,258
So am I.

425
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,554
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

426
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,432
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

427
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,352
Our baby!

428
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,937
Okay, okay.

429
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,189
Maybe Po has
finally met his match,

430
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,151
but there is still something that he
has that The Chameleon does not.

431
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,278
- What's that?
- Us.

432
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,198
Now, let's go find our son.

433
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,407
I hope Po's okay.

434
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,452
You know, Li, a
wise goose once said,

435
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,497
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

436
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,999
- Who was that idiot?
- Me, of course.

437
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,543
I was the wise goose.

438
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,294
Oh, yeah.

439
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,213
Whoa.

440
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,257
That's the biggest
village I've ever seen.

441
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,050
That's no village.

442
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,010
That's Juniper City.

443
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:37,845
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

444
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,389
Just a boat ride away.

445
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,975
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

446
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,935
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

447
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,856
For the right price, those cutthroats
will take us anywhere we want to go.

448
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,525
Of course, we could always
opt for the four-finger discount.

449
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,819
No stealing.

450
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,320
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

451
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,198
Well, that sounds inviting.

452
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,122
Anybody lose a rabbit?

453
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,629
Stir faster!

454
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:16,134
Welcome to the
Happy Bunny Tavern.

455
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:18,971
I'll find us a ride. Maybe
you can get us some food.

456
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,931
And stay out of trouble.

457
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,559
Hey, what you guys playing?

458
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,311
Mah-jongg.

459
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,979
And the stakes are high.

460
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,063
Can I play?

461
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,484
Surely you'll go easy on a
beginner, 'cause I'm very beginning.

462
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,362
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

463
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,239
A boat ride to Juniper City.

464
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,325
Ask this guy.

465
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,870
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

466
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,414
Thanks.

467
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,336
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

468
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:53,213
Never played before, huh?

469
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,215
I'm sorry, are you
accusing me of cheating?

470
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,508
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

471
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,511
I am the manager.

472
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:04,224
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper
City, but I won't carry anything illegal.

473
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,600
I don't want any trouble.

474
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,560
Trouble runs from me.

475
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,020
Then it'll cost you double.

476
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:11,564
I'm confused. Should I
have said that I like trouble?

477
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,399
In that case, it'll
cost you triple.

478
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,070
Oh. Uh, maybe we can
go back to the double price?

479
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,490
You got a deal.

480
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,452
Great. Do I shake
his hand or your hand?

481
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,870
Can I get anything
else for you, ma'am?

482
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:27,330
Yes. Everything, again.

483
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:29,374
Except for the broth.
It was very bland.

484
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,960
Keep stirring!

485
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,130
Whoa! One of everything
is my go-to order.

486
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,173
But how did you pay for this?

487
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,133
Legally. Lawfully.
Fair and square.

488
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,594
I'm proud of you.

489
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:52,689
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

490
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,608
Remember we have to do that
thing down by the place with that guy?

491
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,113
Did you actually think you
could grift a meal out of me?

492
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:03,158
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

493
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,579
And apparently, I'm the
one misunderstanding.

494
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,707
Please allow us to pay
for our meal and yours too.

495
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,709
I'm only hungry for...

496
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,168
- Dumplings?
- Vengeance!

497
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,129
Well, then, come and get it.

498
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,131
No! No, no, no!
Don't come and get it!

499
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,175
Destroy them!

500
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:33,898
I got it!

501
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:45,409
There you go.

502
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:48,828
All better.

503
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,581
Come on! Gotcha.

504
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:52,833
Keep stirring!

505
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,718
Oh, yeah!

506
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,988
I'll take that.

507
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,368
Think this belongs to you.

508
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,840
No stealing!

509
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:49,097
Yeah, I think it's a
little too late for that.

510
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:51,391
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

511
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,017
Get them!

512
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,770
- Watch out!
- Whoa!

513
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,988
Skadoosh!

514
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,205
Whoa. Nice move.
You gotta teach me that.

515
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,333
You die, panda!

516
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:30,806
Ah! Uh.

517
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,309
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

518
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,395
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

519
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:40,107
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

520
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,692
Huh?

521
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:43,944
Uh-oh.

522
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:49,909
Sail ho!

523
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:59,418
Back up! Move, move, move!

524
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:04,756
Not that I'm worried, but...

525
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,175
what if The Chameleon
knows we're coming?

526
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:09,385
Why, she could be
anywhere, anyone.

527
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:12,263
Li, would you please
show a little backbone?

528
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,767
I'm sorry, but bravery was
never really my specialty.

529
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:20,563
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

530
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,733
Act brave? Got it.

531
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,401
- Ah!
- Oh!

532
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:26,819
Oh, Li!

533
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,197
Hold on!

534
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:32,033
Hold me, Ping! It's
all been for nothing!

535
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,535
Please, no.

536
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:35,955
I'm too young!

537
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,251
How was that for acting brave?

538
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,170
Keep working on it.

539
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:49,425
Juniper City.

540
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,344
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

541
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,346
Does your family live there too?

542
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,683
They would. If I had a family.

543
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,853
It wasn't easy being
a little fox in a big city.

544
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,021
<i>So I had to survive
any way I could.</i>

545
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,064
Hey!

546
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:06,192
<i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

547
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,821
Stop running! Stop running!

548
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:16,911
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

549
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:18,371
Well, I mean I was.

550
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:22,292
My goose dad adopted me, and
then later, my panda dad found me.

551
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:26,004
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

552
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,548
Right, Mom?

553
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,425
Then, one day,
a local took me in.

554
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:33,887
Put a roof over my head, gave
me clothes to wear, food to eat.

555
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,264
After that, I was
never alone again.

556
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:37,473
I guess we both got lucky.

557
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,516
I guess.

558
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,894
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

559
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:41,936
Peace.

560
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:43,438
What did that angry
little squirrel mean...

561
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,356
Red panda.

562
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:46,400
When he said you had
to find your successor?

563
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,986
Now that I'm supposed to
become Spiritual Leader,

564
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:53,072
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

565
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,241
Once you're on top, that's
where you wanna stay, right?

566
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:58,328
No, it's just that... What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

567
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,872
I can't even come up with one
of those cool-sounding proverbs.

568
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:03,541
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

569
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,753
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

570
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:07,462
Okay.

571
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,840
Everyone knows life's
greatest enemy is time.

572
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,885
I guess it's just easier to
hold on to the life you know

573
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,386
than move on to
the one you don't.

574
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:17,180
Hey, that was pretty good.

575
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,098
Yeah.

576
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:21,936
Maybe she should be the Spiritual
Leader of the Valley of Geese.

577
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:25,897
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

578
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,441
Should he be driving?

579
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,593
We've come to pay
tribute, as you requested.

580
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:57,470
Looks a little light.

581
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,347
Go back out and get me more!

582
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,266
More?

583
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,432
But... But, Chameleon...

584
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:05,062
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

585
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,193
At last, my destiny approaches.

586
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:20,409
I'll expand my rule from Juniper
City to every city and town and village

587
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,039
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond!

588
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,338
They will all know the
name of The Chameleon!

589
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,674
<i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

590
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:38,887
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

591
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,931
She's gonna take over cities
and towns and the Valley of Peace.

592
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,641
A vision?

593
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,184
While you were asleep?

594
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,603
I'm pretty sure
that's just a dream.

595
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,396
Not a dream, a vision.

596
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:50,481
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

597
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:52,317
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

598
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:54,319
We got to get to The
Chameleon and take her down.

599
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,279
Well, then you're in luck.

600
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,449
Welcome to Juniper City.

601
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,080
Whoa!

602
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:10,376
This is the place where you
can be whatever you wanna be,

603
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,670
do whatever you wanna do,

604
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:15,965
and steal whatever
you wanna steal.

605
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,050
Uh, if that's your thing.

606
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:20,679
Land ho!

607
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,891
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

608
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,318
Ah!

609
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,570
- Whoa!
- Move!

610
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,322
- Look out!
- Sorry!

611
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,407
Out of the way!

612
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,201
I've never seen so
much traffic before.

613
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,286
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

614
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:47,581
No one's ever in that
much of a rush. Oof.

615
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,626
Come on!

616
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,173
Well, sure is good
to be home again.

617
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:59,008
The sights. The sounds.

618
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,720
The smells.

619
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:09,562
It's a wonton wonderland!

620
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,731
Yeah!

621
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,652
Po. Po!

622
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,153
Focus!

623
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:21,239
This city is the most
amazing place I've ever seen!

624
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,618
I used to feel the same way until
The Chameleon got her claws into it.

625
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,006
Tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

626
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,132
Oh, yeah.

627
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:42,802
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

628
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:45,848
Is she lurking in that villainous
tower dominating the city?

629
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,641
How'd you know?

630
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,643
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

631
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,728
Let's keep moving.

632
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,146
- Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

633
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,314
Long time no see.

634
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,232
How you doing, Zhen?

635
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:57,483
Wow, you're quite
the local celeb.

636
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,738
Yeah, well, let's just say a
face like mine is hard to forget.

637
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,575
What? You're a wanted criminal?

638
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,162
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

639
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,164
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

640
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,498
Don't worry.

641
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,709
The law has better things
to do than look for me.

642
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,337
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

643
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:18,463
Must be a slow workweek.

644
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,714
I'll handle this.

645
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,884
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

646
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,346
The fox and I are here on
official Dragon Warrior biz.

647
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,972
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

648
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,432
Dragon Warrior.

649
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,726
Anyone? Nothing?

650
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,729
Perhaps you know me better as...

651
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,857
the Kung Fu Panda!

652
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,901
Wait, wait!

653
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:41,778
Can you believe that guy?

654
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:42,946
Aw, come on!

655
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:46,242
Okay, so we tried it your
way. Now we try it mine.

656
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:52,664
Wait, what's your way...

657
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,749
Sorry.

658
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,835
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

659
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:00,046
You can't run away from the
law. You're a wanted criminal!

660
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,757
Yeah? Well, it looks
like I'm not the only one.

661
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,051
Wow. City life
really is fast-paced.

662
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,012
We gotta get out of
here before they call for...

663
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:10,558
backup.

664
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:16,729
That's a lot of bull.

665
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,274
Run!

666
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,866
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

667
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,209
Ow!

668
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,821
Let's go.

669
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,533
Whoa! Whoa!

670
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,745
I'm falling...

671
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,581
very slowly.

672
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,668
Ow!

673
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,348
Sorry.

674
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:49,697
Whew.

675
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:58,123
There they are!

676
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,211
We don't have
time for a drum solo!

677
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:05,256
We're trapped.

678
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:18,685
It isn't much farther now.

679
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,355
You always say that, and
it's always so much farther.

680
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:26,484
Whoa. What is this place?

681
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:27,944
Home sweet home.

682
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:31,532
Some of the best crooks and
criminals in all of Juniper City live here.

683
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:37,079
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

684
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,791
Uh-oh.

685
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,044
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

686
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:49,758
Ooh!

687
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:56,181
Ow!

688
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,479
Oh!

689
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,732
So you're friends
with all these people?

690
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,025
They're practically family.

691
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:08,360
Zhen!

692
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh! Is that really you?

693
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,161
Han, my old mentor.

694
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:21,122
I always knew someday you'll
find your way home back to the den.

695
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:22,583
And when you did...

696
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:27,212
I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

697
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,546
Family, huh?

698
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:29,881
More like distant cousins.

699
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:31,799
All right. How
should we do this?

700
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,969
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

701
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,389
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

702
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,142
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

703
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:42,685
- Hooray!
- Yay!

704
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,270
You really don't wanna do this.

705
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,355
And why is that?

706
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,607
Because if you so much
as lay one claw on me,

707
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,276
you're gonna
have to answer to...

708
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,986
the Dragon Warrior.

709
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,615
Warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior, warrior.

710
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:56,909
Who?

711
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,622
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

712
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,041
Introduce them, Po,

713
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,127
to your fists.

714
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:16,386
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

715
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,388
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

716
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,265
Yes, now.

717
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:23,601
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner
Shifus have differing opinions?

718
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,978
We are in total agreement...

719
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,980
with our mutual
disappointment...

720
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,148
in you.

721
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:30,985
Wait.

722
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,656
He who resorts
to violence now...

723
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:40,201
will only find more
violence later.

724
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,202
Huh?

725
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:46,708
So what you're saying is, if
we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

726
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,668
We can hurt her a lot later.

727
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,503
What? No, that's
not what I said.

728
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:54,549
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

729
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,926
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of...

730
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,344
- More violence!
- Hooray!

731
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,930
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

732
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,057
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

733
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:06,686
- I like it.
- Violence, violence, violence.

734
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,896
No, no, no! Wait!

735
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:08,980
Come back!

736
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:10,941
I'll come up with better wisdom.

737
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,903
You have got to
workshop those proverbs.

738
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,947
- Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

739
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,782
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

740
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,701
Those are both
very common names.

741
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,494
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

742
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,163
Trained by Master Shifu?

743
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,373
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

744
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,834
Everyone's heard of the
legendary Master Shifu.

745
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:30,878
But not you.

746
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:34,340
Did someone say
"legendary"? Bring it in.

747
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,717
Look, Han.

748
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,720
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

749
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,430
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

750
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,266
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

751
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:49,729
Oh!

752
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,857
We just need someplace to lie
low for a while until the heat cools off.

753
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,400
And why should I help you?

754
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,070
Because deep down beneath
that iron-scaled exterior

755
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:58,571
is a good-hearted soul

756
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,491
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

757
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:02,659
Fine.

758
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,205
But if you're still here by
nightfall, I'm calling the bulls myself.

759
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:07,914
Sleep tight.

760
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:14,212
So tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

761
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,798
After you get your pants back.

762
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,383
Not cool! You guys...

763
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,009
Come on! Give them back.

764
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,428
Those are custom.

765
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:31,146
Yeah, this place
doesn't look very friendly.

766
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,358
Oh! Oh, my tail.

767
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:37,527
I'm sure everything is fine.

768
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:38,987
This is a restaurant.

769
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:41,990
These are my people. We
speak the same language.

770
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,242
You wait here.

771
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:47,120
Salutations!

772
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,706
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

773
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:51,165
I know you're
having a good time,

774
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:55,838
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

775
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,882
There was a panda here.

776
00:44:58,549 --> 00:44:59,632
You know him?

777
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:02,428
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

778
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:06,724
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

779
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:10,936
You need to pay for what
your son did to my tavern.

780
00:45:15,107 --> 00:45:18,234
My boy wouldn't have
done this for no reason.

781
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,195
Is it possible your
broth was bland?

782
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:21,572
Try it.

783
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:24,324
No, no!

784
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:26,326
The broth smells excellent.

785
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:30,079
You should not add a single
thing, especially not me!

786
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,624
Hands off the goose.

787
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:36,628
The panda's back.

788
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,087
- He's back?
- He's back?

789
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,173
No.

790
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,926
But you're about to wish he was,

791
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:45,386
'cause if you think he
made a mess of this place,

792
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:48,348
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

793
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,310
Everything he learned,
he learned from me.

794
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:55,523
Except one thing.

795
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,106
Mercy.

796
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,779
I don't know where he got
that, because I don't believe in it.

797
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:06,616
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

798
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:10,995
The easy way, in which
you tell me where he is,

799
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:12,080
or the hard way,

800
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,832
in which you tell
me where he is,

801
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,793
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

802
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:18,170
because you have no teeth.

803
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:26,844
Mah-jongg.

804
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:29,932
I eat mah-jongg
tiles for breakfast!

805
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:58,669
Huh?

806
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:11,764
Stay there!

807
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:12,807
Where's our son?

808
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,684
He took a boat to Juniper City.

809
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:15,853
Which way?

810
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:19,105
You know, a wise goose once...

811
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,398
Time to go.

812
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,734
Uh, yeah. Right.

813
00:47:52,348 --> 00:47:54,098
Okay, let's try this again.

814
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:58,854
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

815
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,690
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

816
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,526
Not gonna happen with a broom.

817
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:05,693
Yeah? Still not bad though.

818
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:11,032
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

819
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:12,492
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

820
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,662
And "ska-blam" is?

821
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:20,626
Ska-blam!

822
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,759
I gotta say, you're not like any
of the other masters I've met.

823
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,886
Yeah, I know. There's
not a lot of pandas.

824
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:34,806
No, you're, like, a good guy.

825
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:37,225
Listen up. The coast is clear.

826
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:39,686
Thieves, hit the streets.

827
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,020
And you two,

828
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,690
get out of my sight.

829
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:55,494
Huh?

830
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,296
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

831
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:09,048
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

832
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:13,386
I gotta say, Zhen, you
really are a fox of your word.

833
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:15,513
A chewed-up peach pit?

834
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:18,475
One from Master Oogway's
peach tree of heavenly wisdom.

835
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:21,853
Eh, it's a Valley
of Peace thing.

836
00:49:21,854 --> 00:49:26,108
It's supposed to remind me that every
pit holds the promise of a mighty tree.

837
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,112
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

838
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,702
Are you sure you wanna do this?

839
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:40,580
As a wise Spiritual
Leader once said,

840
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:45,628
how may one kick butt, if
one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

841
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:49,881
You're a real piece of
work, you know that?

842
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,132
Thank you.

843
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,760
Wait, was that a
compliment or an insult?

844
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:54,887
Yes.

845
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:04,521
Whoa.

846
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:09,068
Have you seen our son?

847
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:17,200
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

848
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,493
- Nope.
- Nah.

849
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:20,454
Tell us you've seen our son.

850
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:25,376
Wait, why are they
leaving? You said yes.

851
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,003
Hey, look. Po was here.

852
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,464
Amazing, Li, but
how can you tell?

853
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:34,509
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

854
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,929
Come on. There may
be more clues up ahead.

855
00:51:11,755 --> 00:51:13,340
Why?

856
00:52:06,352 --> 00:52:07,685
That was close.

857
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:09,062
Look out!

858
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:10,314
Huh?

859
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:14,193
- Po!
- Stand back.

860
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,322
Whoa!

861
00:52:19,865 --> 00:52:22,284
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

862
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,124
It's no use.

863
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:33,044
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

864
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:35,214
All right, stand
back. Here I go.

865
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:38,384
Zhen?

866
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,179
Where are you taking my staff?

867
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:46,891
I think you mean my staff?

868
00:52:46,892 --> 00:52:50,728
You gave it to Zhen, and
now Zhen has given it to me.

869
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,940
"Given to gain," I
believe, is how it works?

870
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,567
You were right, Zhen.

871
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:56,985
He was an easy mark.

872
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,361
Zhen...

873
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,531
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

874
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,533
I taught her that.

875
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,244
And you thought my
apprentice was your friend?

876
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:07,495
Apprentice?

877
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:09,414
She's the one that took you in?

878
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:11,833
Best thing that ever
happened to her.

879
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,211
You should have seen the little
guttersnipe before I found her.

880
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:17,298
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

881
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,802
<i>hanging out with those
rejects from the Den of Thieves.</i>

882
00:53:43,282 --> 00:53:44,950
<i>She had no fear.</i>

883
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:47,745
<i>Such potential.</i>

884
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,045
So I took her in.

885
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,923
I made her what she is today.

886
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:01,507
Stand up straight.

887
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:02,675
Yes, master.

888
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:06,346
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

889
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:07,430
Why?

890
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:13,312
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

891
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:15,355
I wanted respect and power.

892
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:18,107
I wanted to be a
master of kung fu.

893
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,192
Say what?

894
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:22,779
I was turned away from
every training hall I went to.

895
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,866
They would say I was
too small, too lowly,

896
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:30,078
and that kung fu
was not my destiny.

897
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,331
And so, I chose
a different path.

898
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,083
Sorcery.

899
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:36,335
I grew.

900
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:38,628
I excelled.

901
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:42,465
And I got everything I
had ever dreamed of.

902
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,426
Everything except kung fu.

903
00:54:45,427 --> 00:54:49,640
Just because I can look like Tai
Lung doesn't mean I can fight like him.

904
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:54,894
You see, Po, kung fu may
be performed by the body,

905
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:57,981
but its secrets are
housed in the spirit.

906
00:54:57,982 --> 00:55:00,608
And now that I have
access to the Spirit Realm...

907
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,819
You're gonna steal
Tai Lung's kung fu.

908
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,406
His and those of every master
villain that came before me.

909
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:11,327
And once I do, no one will
dare underestimate me again.

910
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:13,372
You forgot about me.

911
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,167
Don't bother, Po.

912
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:23,339
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

913
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,302
You'd need at least ten Dragon
Warriors to get through them.

914
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:28,845
Then I won't go through them.

915
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:30,973
I'll go under them.

916
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:47,907
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

917
00:55:56,332 --> 00:55:57,666
Whoa!

918
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,196
- Po!
- Zhen?

919
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:29,322
My staff! Hand it over.

920
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:32,325
I'm so sorry I lied to you. I
was just doing what I was told.

921
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:34,661
Apologize later. Right now, I
have to stop The Chameleon.

922
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:36,412
Po!

923
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:37,748
Zhen?

924
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,380
No!

925
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,220
Well done, Zhen.

926
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:54,430
You never said you
were gonna hurt him.

927
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,642
What's the second
rule of the streets?

928
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:59,227
Someone always gets hurt.

929
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:01,313
And make sure it's never you.

930
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:05,108
I just wish there had
been another way.

931
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:06,819
Third rule of the streets?

932
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,570
Third rule?

933
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:11,197
Some would say it's
the most important:

934
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:14,827
No one is interested
in your feelings.

935
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,081
Chop-chop! We have a
Spirit Realm to plunder.

936
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:22,000
And smile.

937
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:24,210
Nobody likes a grouch.

938
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:27,840
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know
where you pick up such bad habits.

939
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:36,557
If I could...

940
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,436
Hey there.

941
00:57:42,188 --> 00:57:43,731
Whoa!

942
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:47,776
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

943
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,366
Son!

944
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,585
Now save me.

945
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,921
Hi, Son.

946
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:13,344
It's okay. We've got
you, Po. We've got you.

947
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,096
So you followed me.

948
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,473
It was his idea.

949
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,433
Okay, okay. It
was both our ideas.

950
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,602
We only follow because we love.

951
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:25,564
No, you followed because
you didn't believe in me.

952
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:27,900
And because we love?

953
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:31,070
Well, you're right.

954
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:33,531
I screwed up big-time.

955
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,241
I trusted the wrong person.

956
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:38,827
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

957
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:41,497
Oh...

958
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:46,835
Po, that was a very
big-time screw-up.

959
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:53,216
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

960
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:56,803
The Chameleon wouldn't have my
staff, and none of this would be happening.

961
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:59,764
I was just so determined to
keep things the way they were.

962
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,934
Everyone is afraid
of change, Po.

963
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:04,561
Even me.

964
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:07,438
There was a time not so long ago

965
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:12,360
when all I wanted to be was the
greatest noodle chef in the valley.

966
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:13,821
So what happened?

967
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:16,906
I became the greatest
noodle chef in the valley.

968
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,032
It's true.

969
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,077
But I also became a father.

970
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:23,914
And nothing... nothing's
ever been the same since.

971
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,375
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

972
00:59:27,376 --> 00:59:30,963
Why do you think I always
change the menu at the restaurant?

973
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,133
Because if things
stayed the same forever,

974
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:38,012
sooner or later, they
would lose their flavor.

975
00:59:39,638 --> 00:59:40,763
He's right, Po.

976
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:44,058
Since I left my village, I've
become a bit of a warrior.

977
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,978
Strong. Brave.

978
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:49,230
Move it.

979
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:50,316
This way.

980
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:53,652
Get those cages
up there. Come on.

981
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:56,571
Hmm. This looks bad.

982
00:59:56,572 --> 00:59:57,697
Really bad.

983
00:59:57,698 --> 00:59:58,781
Move it.

984
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,701
Come on.

985
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:10,168
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

986
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:12,795
What? No. It's-It's just...

987
01:00:12,796 --> 01:00:16,549
When we want something, we must
use whatever is at our disposal to get it.

988
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,803
That's all that panda
was, something to use.

989
01:00:21,472 --> 01:00:26,184
Is that why you took me in? So I
could help you get what you wanted?

990
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,602
Zhen.

991
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:32,065
I took you in because you were
clever and ruthless and unsentimental,

992
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,149
like me.

993
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,527
And the day you stop
being those things

994
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:39,906
is the day when, yes, you
stop being useful to me.

995
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:43,494
So for both of our
sakes, don't change.

996
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:55,630
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

997
01:00:55,631 --> 01:01:01,554
I will open the door to the Spirit
Realm, and all of its secrets will be mine!

998
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:10,062
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

999
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:14,567
I seem to remember
it rising faster.

1000
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,569
No?

1001
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,654
Just me?

1002
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:20,823
Hmm.

1003
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,117
Ugh.

1004
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,286
It's just for dramatic
effect anyway.

1005
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,248
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1006
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:42,887
Bring me Tai Lung!

1007
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:54,148
Tai Lung.

1008
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:56,232
Big fan.

1009
01:01:56,233 --> 01:01:59,110
Who are you, and what
are you doing with that staff?

1010
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:02,238
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1011
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,740
The puffy panda?

1012
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:05,200
Po might be an idiot,

1013
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:09,162
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1014
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,540
Who said anything
about willingly?

1015
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:24,802
Hmm. Apparently I
misjudged you, lizard.

1016
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:27,305
Now, why have you
brought me back?

1017
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:29,474
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1018
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:31,559
your most legendary
kung fu moves.

1019
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,687
I don't share my
skills with anyone.

1020
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:36,398
It wasn't a request.

1021
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,450
Yes, I got it!

1022
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:31,536
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1023
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:33,706
The power, the precision.

1024
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:39,586
What have you done to me?

1025
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:43,173
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1026
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:48,553
And the best part is, I'm
just getting warmed up.

1027
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:50,931
Bring me General Kai.

1028
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:57,271
Bring me Master Osprey.

1029
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,525
Master Bull.

1030
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:09,282
Po, wait!

1031
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:11,576
Please be reasonable.

1032
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:13,786
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1033
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,872
No staff is worth your life.

1034
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:18,291
As long as I'm still
the Dragon Warrior,

1035
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,920
I won't let anyone else
get hurt because of me.

1036
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:38,853
Po!

1037
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:40,898
You're alive!

1038
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,027
Please. I made a mistake.

1039
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:48,906
So did I. Trusting you.

1040
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,490
I'm sorry.

1041
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:52,867
Did your master tell
you to say that too?

1042
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:56,080
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1043
01:04:56,914 --> 01:04:58,206
It's the truth.

1044
01:04:58,207 --> 01:05:00,292
I was wrong about everything.

1045
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:04,003
What are you doing?

1046
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,630
Stopping you.

1047
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:07,507
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1048
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,759
No.

1049
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:10,469
Move.

1050
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,220
You want me to move?

1051
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,513
Move me.

1052
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:16,100
First you betray me, and
now you wanna fight me?

1053
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,685
Why are you doing this?

1054
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:21,689
To stop you from getting killed.

1055
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:51,886
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

1056
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,360
Please, Po.

1057
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,572
Just let me do one thing right.

1058
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:19,580
You're not the only one who's
made some bad choices lately.

1059
01:06:21,582 --> 01:06:23,708
You're really gonna go
through with this, aren't you?

1060
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:24,834
'Fraid so.

1061
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:27,754
And there's nothing I
can do to talk you out of it?

1062
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:28,922
I'm afraid not.

1063
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:30,924
You can't beat her, you know.

1064
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:32,509
You're probably right.

1065
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,387
But I have to try.

1066
01:06:37,014 --> 01:06:38,973
Get as far away from
this place as you can.

1067
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,058
Po!

1068
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:42,268
We should never
have let him come here.

1069
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,521
We are such terrible fathers.

1070
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:46,439
At least you didn't
lie and betray him.

1071
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,858
Well, that's true. You're worse.

1072
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:50,777
I am a terrible friend.

1073
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:53,488
"Friend"? That feels
a little generous, no?

1074
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,698
Uh, l-let's just
give up. Surrender.

1075
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,367
We can't let him
go in there alone.

1076
01:06:57,368 --> 01:06:58,952
What can we do?

1077
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:01,412
There are just three
of us against an army.

1078
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:04,208
Then I guess we'll just have
to get an army of our own.

1079
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:19,098
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1080
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:25,521
Quack!

1081
01:07:27,898 --> 01:07:29,148
Thank you.

1082
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:31,235
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1083
01:07:32,152 --> 01:07:34,238
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1084
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:36,866
The panda.

1085
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,995
No, no. A different panda.

1086
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:44,206
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1087
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,124
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1088
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:49,794
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1089
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,754
So, I need yours.

1090
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:53,590
Why should we help you?

1091
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:54,924
Because...

1092
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:56,010
Because...

1093
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,429
it's the right thing to do.

1094
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,726
Stop it. Stop.

1095
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:06,061
Stop laughing.

1096
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,689
Look, I know you
think it might be too late

1097
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,444
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1098
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:19,531
but a good friend once told me it's
never too late to do the right thing.

1099
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:23,076
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1100
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,120
the more wrong we can do later.

1101
01:08:25,121 --> 01:08:26,330
What? No.

1102
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,875
And with The Chameleon
out of the way...

1103
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:31,085
We can finally do all
the wrong we want.

1104
01:08:31,086 --> 01:08:33,129
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1105
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,757
Violence, violence, violence.

1106
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:39,595
Are you guys ready to do the
right thing for the wrong reasons?

1107
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,185
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1108
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:48,978
was underestimating
his opponent.

1109
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:51,940
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1110
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:53,442
Hey.

1111
01:08:56,028 --> 01:08:58,696
Now, you see, the mistake this
Dragon Warrior fellow made was that...

1112
01:08:58,697 --> 01:09:00,366
Shut up, Larry.

1113
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:07,413
This place is crawling with
more guards than I've ever seen.

1114
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,499
I'm never gonna
get to Po in time.

1115
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,293
You just get to Po. We'll
take care of the guards.

1116
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:13,670
We will?

1117
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,170
I-I mean, we will.

1118
01:09:15,171 --> 01:09:16,382
But how?

1119
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:18,550
Just leave that to me.

1120
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,250
General Kai?

1121
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:53,250
Lord Shen?

1122
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:57,213
Those are all my old
nemesis-es. Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1123
01:09:57,214 --> 01:10:00,258
The Chameleon is pulling
spirits from the Spirit Realm

1124
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:02,302
and draining us
of all our moves.

1125
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:05,138
And she's using
your staff to do it.

1126
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:07,140
I'm here to get it back.

1127
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:08,641
I won't hold my breath.

1128
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:10,185
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1129
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:11,979
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1130
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:15,732
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1131
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:18,818
Oh, right! Scott!

1132
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:21,112
Master Shifu and I were
just talking about you.

1133
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:22,573
Panda.

1134
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,952
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1135
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:32,207
I just didn't realize how big
a mistake it was until now.

1136
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,751
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1137
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:38,296
I'm gonna get that staff
back, restore your kung fu,

1138
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:40,757
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

1139
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,091
You'll see.

1140
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:43,427
All I see

1141
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:46,180
is a broken promise.

1142
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:55,813
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1143
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:59,108
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

1144
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,904
The easy way, in which
you surrender willingly,

1145
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:07,033
or the hard way, where
you surrender woundedly.

1146
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:09,828
The choice is yours.

1147
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:16,085
I was kidding! I was kidding!

1148
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,011
Aw.

1149
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,765
Ow! Ow!

1150
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,102
Thanks, Ping.

1151
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:38,566
Run away!

1152
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,656
Cannonball!

1153
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:55,331
Oh, is it too spicy?

1154
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:58,084
Mmm. No. It's got
the perfect kick.

1155
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:01,338
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1156
01:12:08,304 --> 01:12:11,557
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

1157
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:13,517
Yay!

1158
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:22,067
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

1159
01:12:25,446 --> 01:12:27,614
Can't you even die right?

1160
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:29,574
Can't you even kill wrong?

1161
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:31,910
No. Wordplay
didn't come together.

1162
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:33,245
Now, about that staff...

1163
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:36,623
Take it.

1164
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:39,293
I already have everything
I need from it anyway.

1165
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:42,086
I think this was destiny.

1166
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:46,591
A final face-off between
formidable adversaries,

1167
01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:49,427
alike in so many ways.

1168
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:51,054
If only I had a
dumpling for every time

1169
01:12:51,055 --> 01:12:52,972
a villain told me how
much we had in common.

1170
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:54,057
It's true.

1171
01:12:54,058 --> 01:12:56,392
We've both risen to
the highest of heights.

1172
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:59,521
It's a shame only one of
us can come out on top.

1173
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:02,148
It is a shame, for you.

1174
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:07,111
My combined powers of sorcery
and kung fu make me unstoppable.

1175
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:11,574
And once I dispense with you, I'll
expand my rule from Juniper City to...

1176
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:13,368
Every other city
and town and village

1177
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,119
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond.

1178
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,329
Yeah, I know.

1179
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,414
But how did you know?

1180
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:22,378
I saw it in a vision because
I'm the Dragon Warrior...

1181
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:25,880
for now at least.

1182
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:29,468
But I've realized that it's
probably time I made a change.

1183
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:31,970
And so should you.

1184
01:13:31,971 --> 01:13:34,847
I'm The Chameleon. I
do nothing but change.

1185
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:36,683
Only on the outside.

1186
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,435
Real change happens from within.

1187
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,896
And if we're really
as alike as you say,

1188
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:43,940
then maybe we could
both let go of who we were

1189
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:46,360
and become something
better than we already are.

1190
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:49,655
- What do you say?
- I say...

1191
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:53,742
Well, I saw that coming.

1192
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:57,745
We're very proud of you.

1193
01:13:57,746 --> 01:13:58,955
You tried it our way.

1194
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:01,082
Now try it yours.

1195
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:03,334
Kick her butt.

1196
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:05,254
I'm way ahead of you.

1197
01:14:13,304 --> 01:14:15,472
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1198
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,769
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1199
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:23,856
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1200
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,863
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1201
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,490
What?

1202
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:35,826
Recognize this move?

1203
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:41,164
Is that how I sound? I
don't sound like that, do I?

1204
01:14:41,165 --> 01:14:44,418
You didn't earn those
skills. You just stole them!

1205
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:47,086
Give him a left,
a right, uppercut.

1206
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:50,673
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1207
01:14:50,674 --> 01:14:53,426
I'm stronger than every
opponent you've ever faced,

1208
01:14:53,427 --> 01:14:56,846
because I am every
opponent you've ever faced.

1209
01:14:56,847 --> 01:14:57,847
Po!

1210
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:13,196
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1211
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:15,491
Nah, it was just right.

1212
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:20,662
I knew I should have left you to
rot in the gutter where you belong.

1213
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,290
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1214
01:15:31,382 --> 01:15:33,299
Two against one?

1215
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,510
Well, now, that
doesn't seem fair.

1216
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:37,680
I'll have to even the odds.

1217
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:40,558
Master Cobra.

1218
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,309
Master Osprey.

1219
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:45,353
Master Scorpion.

1220
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,397
Master Wolf.

1221
01:15:47,398 --> 01:15:49,858
General Kai.

1222
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:51,151
Lord Shen.

1223
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,409
That is awesome!

1224
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:01,537
I mean, it's disturbing,
but it's awesome.

1225
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:19,929
Whoa!

1226
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:22,182
Zhen!

1227
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,614
No!

1228
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:44,288
Whoa, whoa!

1229
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:58,093
Po!

1230
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,602
I thought we were friends.

1231
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,562
Stand back.

1232
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:11,899
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1233
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:35,940
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1234
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:38,401
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1235
01:18:38,402 --> 01:18:40,028
A wise, old tortoise
once told me

1236
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:42,280
that you never know what
you can do until you do it.

1237
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,449
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1238
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,035
and you're here giving me
life advice from a tortoise?

1239
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:48,621
Be the pit, Zhen.

1240
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:50,956
Be the pit.

1241
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:02,383
And what do you
think you're doing?

1242
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,135
Finishing what Po started.

1243
01:19:04,136 --> 01:19:07,014
Oh, please. How many
times do I have to tell you?

1244
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,434
Don't slouch.

1245
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:22,737
You ungrateful little urchin.

1246
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:26,909
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1247
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:31,663
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

1248
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:35,083
Ha! You can't defeat
me. I know all your moves.

1249
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,668
Not this one.

1250
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:40,296
Roll, stir, serve,

1251
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:42,424
and ska-blam!

1252
01:19:47,137 --> 01:19:50,014
Yes!

1253
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,310
Second rule: Someone
always gets hurt.

1254
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:55,562
Now, that's a cool move.

1255
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:58,398
Po! You could have gotten out
of that cage anytime you wanted?

1256
01:19:58,399 --> 01:19:59,566
You faker.

1257
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,651
It's not faking. It's Method.

1258
01:20:01,652 --> 01:20:04,863
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

1259
01:20:04,864 --> 01:20:07,658
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

1260
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,745
And, hey, you stirred
faster and rolled higher.

1261
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,749
But for the last
time, the word is...

1262
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:24,008
"skadoosh."

1263
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:52,494
Maybe Oogway
was right about you.

1264
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:57,583
You aren't completely
useless after all.

1265
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,002
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

1266
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:12,889
That's my son.

1267
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,058
Our son.

1268
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,271
I think it's time you
send us home, panda.

1269
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:56,057
Zhen, do something!

1270
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:59,854
Third rule: No one's
interested in your feelings.

1271
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:08,946
See you on the other
side, Dragon Warrior.

1272
01:22:31,427 --> 01:22:33,595
We packed some
food for your time in jail.

1273
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:36,389
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

1274
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,933
Thanks, guys.

1275
01:22:38,809 --> 01:22:43,521
I was thinking, after I serve
my time and I'm a free fox again,

1276
01:22:43,522 --> 01:22:46,357
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

1277
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:51,197
I think you're better suited for a
job with a little more room for growth.

1278
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:56,035
Jade Palace?

1279
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,621
Her?

1280
01:22:59,622 --> 01:23:03,499
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

1281
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,210
you chose the fox?

1282
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,295
You know when
you know, you know?

1283
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,923
Fine, choose who you
want. A thief, a stick, a carrot.

1284
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:11,716
I don't even know why I bother.

1285
01:23:11,717 --> 01:23:14,553
I'm going to go
meditate... a lot.

1286
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:18,891
Don't worry. He'll come around.

1287
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:21,560
Probably. Maybe.

1288
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:24,939
Hey, you okay?

1289
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:29,610
He's right. What about
me says I'm ready for this?

1290
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:33,112
Well, as I learned from
working in my dad's kitchen,

1291
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:37,700
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1292
01:23:37,701 --> 01:23:39,786
Hey, that's not bad.

1293
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:41,621
Okay, I see you,
Spiritual Leader.

1294
01:23:41,622 --> 01:23:44,457
Yeah. I'm getting the
hang of this proverb thing.

1295
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,585
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1296
01:23:47,586 --> 01:23:49,587
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

1297
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:53,466
Money can't buy happiness, but
it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

1298
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,802
Why does it always come
back to dumplings with you?

1299
01:23:55,803 --> 01:24:00,557
When life gives you lemons, make
pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

1300
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:01,641
We get it.

1301
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:04,562
You can't have your
mooncake and eat it too.

1302
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:08,398
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

1303
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:10,317
Can we just start
the training now?

1304
01:24:12,903 --> 01:24:14,321
Inner peace.

1305
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:16,657
Inner peace.

1306
01:24:17,449 --> 01:24:18,741
Inner peace.

1307
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:19,826
Hey, Master Shifu.

1308
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:20,910
Look, there's two of us.

1309
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:23,037
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

1310
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,874
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

1311
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,836
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

1312
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:35,259
Inner peace.

1313
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:38,137
Inner peace.

1314
01:24:39,513 --> 01:24:41,307
Inner peace.

1315
01:24:49,773 --> 01:24:51,567
Are you ready to
begin your training?

1316
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:53,401
Are you?

1317
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:55,988
Yes, and I
brought a little help.
