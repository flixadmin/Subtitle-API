1
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,180
Now, children, are you
sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,261
Then I’ll begin.

3
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,541
This story stared
many thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,901
But it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,901
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:53,101
None of the things
we can see now--

7
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:56,222
The sun, the moon,
the stars, the earth...

8
00:00:56,262 --> 00:01:00,062
The animals and plants--
Not a single one existed.

9
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,062
Only god existed...

10
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:04,702
And so only he
could have created them.

11
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:06,423
And he did.

12
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,074
Simpson.
What a character he was.

13
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:21,354
I wonder
whatever became of him ?

14
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,794
Oh, I imagine he's dead
like all the rest.

15
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,474
Ah, those were the days.

16
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:37,835
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.

17
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,236
Yes ?

18
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:50,236
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the--

19
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:53,797
Oh, yes, of course.

20
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,077
Come in.

21
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:58,837
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

22
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,158
You are... ?

23
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,798
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

24
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:12,078
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

25
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,798
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

26
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,598
You must be the gardener.

27
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,959
That's right. The gardener.

28
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:21,999
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

29
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,519
Have you had
much experience in service ?

30
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,759
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

31
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,880
She's older than she looks.

32
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Can you iron ?

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,200
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue ?

34
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,481
She can't talk, ma'am.

35
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,201
The poor little mite's a mute.

36
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,321
Oh, but she's
a good little worker.

37
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,561
I can promise you that.

38
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:49,161
All right.

39
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,762
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

40
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:54,522
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl...

41
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,322
Will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

42
00:04:57,362 --> 00:05:00,722
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

43
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:05,323
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

44
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:08,723
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

45
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:11,163
Since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

46
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,363
You mean they just vanished?

47
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,164
Into thin air.

48
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,444
No notice, nothing. They didn't
even collect their wages.

49
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,364
They... they just left us.

50
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,644
What a strange thing to do.

51
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,684
You'll soon find out
there are times...

52
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,245
When this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

53
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,005
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

54
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:34,485
Requesting honest,
hard-working people.

55
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,325
There's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

56
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,685
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle ?

57
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,886
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

58
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:44,046
And, um, very hard-working.

59
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,326
The kitchen.

60
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,247
I have breakfast at 8.00...

61
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,327
The children at 9.00.

62
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:56,527
Lunch will be served at 1.00
and dinner at 7.30.

63
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,887
And the master, ma'am ?

64
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,008
The master went off to war...

65
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,928
A year and a half ago.

66
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:09,928
I've had no news
since the war ended.

67
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,408
Which of you does the cooking?

68
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,848
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

69
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,969
Which of you does the cooking?

70
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,889
You'll notice what I’m doing.

71
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:21,489
In this house,
no door must be opened...

72
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,649
Without the previous one
being closed first.

73
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,369
It is vital
that you remember this.

74
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,450
It's not as easy
as it may seem.

75
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,570
There are 1 5 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

76
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,010
Depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

77
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,610
Mrs. Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

78
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,131
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

79
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,611
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,611
The music room.

81
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,011
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

82
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:50,171
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

83
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,932
It sets off my migraine.

84
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:56,652
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

85
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,372
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

86
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,612
Or anything else
that makes a racket.

87
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,893
Oh, we don't have
electricity, either.

88
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,253
During the war, the Germans
kept cutting it off...

89
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,893
So we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

90
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:11,573
Ma'am, there's no need
to show us the whole house.

91
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,813
Yes!.

92
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:15,894
Yes, there is.

93
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,574
Most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

94
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,494
It's often difficult
to make out...

95
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:23,734
If there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

96
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,855
Or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

97
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,975
What do you mean, ma'am ?

98
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:34,055
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

99
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,976
Mr. Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

100
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:43,256
You'll find tools in the shed.

101
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,976
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:47,576
You two can star closing
the curtains.

103
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,256
All of them.

104
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,139
Come.

105
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,260
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

106
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,541
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

107
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,141
Wackey, wackey.

108
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,501
Now, come on.

109
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,422
Eyes closed, hands together.

110
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,502
Let it be, at light of day...

111
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,782
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

112
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:58,182
Blessed be the virgin pure...

113
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,302
Whom I greet with faith
too short.

114
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,503
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose...

115
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,823
Keep us till this day
doth close.

116
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,384
They're still half asleep.

117
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:16,944
What sweet little children.

118
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,344
Well... what do you say?

119
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,424
How do you do ?

120
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:24,384
How do you do ?

121
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,865
How do you do, children ?

122
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,665
My name is Mrs. Mills...

123
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:32,905
But you can call me
Bertha if you like.

124
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,745
What are your names ?

125
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,506
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

126
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:41,946
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.

127
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,866
Are you going to be
our new nanny?

128
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:46,866
Mm-hmm.

129
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:51,347
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

130
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,187
It's time for their breakfast.

131
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,267
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

132
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,028
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

133
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,068
For what?

134
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,428
Their condition.

135
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:13,989
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

136
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,349
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

137
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,749
To any light
much stronger than this.

138
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,069
Otherwise,
in a matter of minutes...

139
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:22,949
They will break out
in sores and blisters...

140
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,230
And begin to suffocate.

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,830
It would eventually be fatal.

142
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,190
Good heavens.

143
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,950
I don't like this toast.

144
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,630
Oh ? Why not?

145
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,791
It tastes funny.

146
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,791
I liked it better before.

147
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:43,151
That's because before,
somebody else made it.

148
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,431
When are they coming back?

149
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,072
They're not coming back, child.

150
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:52,032
Just like daddy.

151
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,592
Daddy is coming back, though.

152
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:58,672
Mrs. Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France.

153
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:00,153
It's the world war.

154
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,073
I know, but he's in France.

155
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:06,393
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

156
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,993
Are you going to leave us, too ?

157
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:13,434
Of course not!

158
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:15,234
Why should I leave you?

159
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,314
The others
said they wouldn't...

160
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,354
But they did,
and then it happened.

161
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,394
Be quiet!

162
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:27,835
What do you mean, Anne ?
What happened?

163
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:32,115
Mummy went... mad.

164
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,915
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

165
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,956
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

166
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,156
Be quiet.

167
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:44,036
What's going on ?
I want those plates empty...

168
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:46,356
In less than a minute.
Is that clear?

169
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,917
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

170
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,997
I'd like a word with you.

171
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,197
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:05,038
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

173
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:06,558
But I just checked
the letter-box...

174
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:08,878
And this week he hasn't.

175
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,918
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.

176
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,879
This letter
should have been collected...

177
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,599
And delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

178
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,119
It's an advertisement
for servants.

179
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,399
Since it was never published...

180
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,159
Would you explain
what you're doing here ?

181
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,120
Oh, I understand.

182
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

183
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,760
When you opened the door to us.

184
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,320
The truth is
that we just come by...

185
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,640
On the off chance.

186
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,241
A big house like this...

187
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,881
Is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

188
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:40,841
You've served in a house
like this one before ?

189
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:43,521
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

190
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,322
We, in fact,
used to work here.

191
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:49,762
Here ?

192
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,282
Oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.

193
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,282
If you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am...

194
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:01,083
They were the best years
of my life.

195
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,483
That's why we come by,
because this house...

196
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,443
Means a lot to us.

197
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,443
Perhaps I’d best show you
our references, ma'am.

198
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:12,284
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.

199
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,484
So you say
you know the house well?

200
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,964
Like the back of my hand.

201
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,124
That is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

202
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,164
And moved in the meantime.

203
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:25,405
The only thing that moves
here is the light.

204
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:30,005
But it changes everything.

205
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,326
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

206
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:42,766
One might
almost say... unbearable.

207
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:48,527
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

208
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,847
Oh, yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,567
I don't like fantasies.

210
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,967
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean ?

211
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:59,088
I think so, ma'am.

212
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:03,088
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

213
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,928
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

214
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:08,968
Children will be children.

215
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,409
Yes, of course, ma'am.

216
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,449
All right. You can stay.

217
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,609
Thank you very much, ma'am.

218
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,211
It did happen.

219
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,092
"The roman governor
tried to make them...

220
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:47,972
"Change their minds
afterwards... "

221
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,292
"To make them change
their minds. " Full stop.

222
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:53,332
- "Afterwards... "
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:54,972
"He ordered them
to be beaten.

224
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:59,173
"But Justus and pastor,
far from being afraid...

225
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,733
"Rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

226
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:03,493
"When he saw this...

227
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,413
"The roman governor
was filled with rage...

228
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,093
"And ordered their heads
to be cut off. "

229
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:16,094
What do you find so amusing?

230
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,574
Well...

231
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,574
Well, what?

232
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,135
Those children
were really stupid.

233
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,215
Why?

234
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,055
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

235
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,775
And then
they got killed for it.

236
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,055
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

237
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,575
Well, yes.

238
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,496
Inside I would have
believed in him...

239
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:37,416
But I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

240
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,096
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas ?

241
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,297
I see.

242
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:51,857
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

243
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:56,297
You'd have saved your heads
from the Romans, that's true.

244
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,058
But what would have
happened afterwards ?

245
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:59,298
When ?

246
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,578
In the next life.

247
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,778
The one waiting for us
after we die.

248
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,778
Where would you have gone ?

249
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:08,618
Where, Nicholas ?

250
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,219
To the children's limbo.

251
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,219
What is the children's
limbo, Anne ?

252
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,379
One of the four hells.

253
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,859
Which are ?

254
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,980
Me, me, me! Me!

255
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,540
No. Let him answer.
Which are ?

256
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,260
There's the hell
where the damned go...

257
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,340
Then there's purgatory...

258
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,700
Yes.

259
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,420
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

260
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,221
And limbo where children go.

261
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,581
At the centre of the earth.

262
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,661
Where it's very, very hot.

263
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,261
That's where children
go who tell lies...

264
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:41,381
But they don't just go
there for a few days.

265
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,821
Oh, no.

266
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,582
No, they're damned. Forever.

267
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:50,102
Think about it.

268
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,862
Try to imagine
the end of eternity.

269
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,223
Close your eyes.

270
00:16:57,263 --> 00:17:00,823
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

271
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,343
Forever.

272
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,623
Pain... forever.

273
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,144
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.

274
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,224
Now do you understand...

275
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:17,304
Why Justus and pastor
told the truth ?

276
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,985
All right.

277
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:25,585
Open your readers
at lesson six.

278
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,945
Can't we play?

279
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:28,705
You most certainly cannot.

280
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,185
First you're going
to read the lesson...

281
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,386
Then you're going
to learn it by hear.

282
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,626
All of it?

283
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,946
Any more protests...

284
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:37,546
And there'll be
no playing at all today.

285
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:41,146
In fact, I think you can
study in separate rooms.

286
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,946
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

287
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,787
But we get scared
if we're separated!

288
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:48,867
Scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

289
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,867
What if we see a ghost?

290
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:53,947
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories ?

291
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,707
I haven't told him anything!

292
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:57,228
If you see a ghost
you say "hello "...

293
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:58,708
And continue on studying.

294
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,908
- Come to the music room.
- Why me ?

295
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,948
Because I say so!
Now come on.

296
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:04,868
Take your book.

297
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,548
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned...

298
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:07,869
In less than an hour.

299
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,629
- Mummy...
- What?

300
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,949
Give me a kiss.

301
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:15,829
"Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss. "

302
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,909
Anne, wait for me outside.

303
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:21,710
You know I can't.

304
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,350
Over there.

305
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,670
Close all the curtains.

306
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,151
My daughter is going
to cross the living room.

307
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:34,231
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,351
All right, Anne.

309
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,952
Darling...

310
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:52,472
Mummy can't be with you
all the time, hmm ?

311
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,313
You must learn to be
on your own.

312
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,873
Where's your rosary?

313
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:06,753
Whenever you feel afraid...

314
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,634
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might...

315
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:13,234
Say an our father,
and your fear will go away.

316
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:17,674
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

317
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,475
Don't you see that
when you do that...

318
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,435
The lord is with you?

319
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:25,075
There's no reason to be afraid.

320
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,478
"The house and the family.

321
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:09,679
"We all live in a house
with our family.

322
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:13,159
"The family is usually
made up of parents...

323
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,759
"Children,
and their grandparents.

324
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,599
"We must be obedient... "

325
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,000
"... And kind towards
other members of our family...

326
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,800
"And we must
never argue or fight...

327
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,360
"With our brothers and sisters. "

328
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,360
Do you have any children ?

329
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,880
No.

330
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,121
Mr. Tuttle and the girl Lydia
are all I’ve got...

331
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:35,601
And I’m all they've got.

332
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,681
Was she born like that?

333
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:40,161
Beg your pardon, ma'am ?

334
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:43,482
The girl. Was she born a mute ?

335
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:47,322
No.

336
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,482
I think
I’ve finished here, ma'am.

337
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:51,602
If you'll excuse me,
I think I’ll go...

338
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:54,203
And see if Mr. Tuttle
needs a hand.

339
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,645
Nicholas!

340
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,366
Nicholas, I’m coming!

341
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:41,486
- Nicholas ?
- What's the matter?

342
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:42,727
Why were you crying?

343
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:45,407
I wasn't crying.
I was reading.

344
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:48,527
But I just heard you...
Anne!

345
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,928
Anne!

346
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,728
Anne ?

347
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,688
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

348
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:07,409
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

349
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:10,529
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't.

350
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:14,289
I just heard you a moment ago.

351
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:16,329
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

352
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,650
I don't.

353
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,090
If I’d been crying,
I’d tell you.

354
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,250
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?

355
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,650
No. It was that boy.

356
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,610
What boy?

357
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,170
Victor.

358
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,531
Who's Victor?

359
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,971
The boy that was here
a moment ago.

360
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:35,851
I told him to let me study...

361
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,051
But he wouldn't stop crying.

362
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,011
I think he's a spoiled brat.

363
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:42,252
He said we'd have
to leave the house.

364
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:45,932
Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?

365
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,652
Because he doesn't
like this house...

366
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:50,932
But he has to live here.
His father's a pianist--

367
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,453
- His father's a pianist?
- Yes.

368
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:56,813
I already told him he's not
allowed to touch the piano.

369
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,053
He isn't, is he, mummy?

370
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,973
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

371
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:03,933
No, only with Victor.

372
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:05,414
His father's with the others
in the hall.

373
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,854
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

374
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:12,574
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

375
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:16,334
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!

376
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,655
Now why were you crying?

377
00:23:17,735 --> 00:23:19,095
It was Victor!

378
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:21,695
- So where is he now?
-He went out through there!

379
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,295
Would you mind
telling me how a boy...

380
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,295
Can get in and out
of this room if it's locked?

381
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:33,616
I thought
I made myself quite clear.

382
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,136
No door is to be opened...

383
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,936
Without the previous one
being closed first.

384
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,216
Is that so hard to understand?

385
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:41,337
This house is like a ship.

386
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:43,417
The light must be contained
as if it were water...

387
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,577
By opening and closing
the doors.

388
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:48,537
My children's lives
are at stake!

389
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:49,777
But, ma'am--

390
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:52,498
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

391
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:55,498
Which was the last of you
to enter that room ?

392
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:56,858
Lydia ?

393
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,698
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

394
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,778
That leaves you, then.

395
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,379
But I was in the hall
the whole time.

396
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,899
And then I went out
into the garden.

397
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,179
You saw me with your own eyes.

398
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:11,579
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me!

399
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,939
Do you think that
I would overlook such a thing...

400
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:17,180
And endanger
the life of my own daughter?

401
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,020
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

402
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,341
Oh, really?

403
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:31,221
Who's going to tell mummy?
You?

404
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:37,541
Or perhaps you?

405
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:44,822
Did you really see a boy?

406
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:46,582
Yes. He's called Victor.

407
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,742
Is he a ghost?

408
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,103
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.

409
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,023
What are they like ?

410
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,543
I've told you
a thousand times.

411
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,703
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

412
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,103
- How do you know?
- Because I’ve seen them.

413
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:05,744
They come out at night.

414
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,944
Fibber. Where ?

415
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:17,345
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

416
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,545
I don't believe
you saw that boy.

417
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,105
Believe what you like.

418
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,945
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

419
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,666
Nicholas!

420
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:41,787
Huh ?
What?

421
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:44,467
Look.

422
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:46,427
Why have you opened
the curtains ?

423
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,507
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then ?

424
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,747
It was Victor.

425
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:53,228
He's been doing it all night.

426
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:55,388
You're lying.
I'm going to tell mummy.

427
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,068
- So I’m a liar, am I?
- Yes.

428
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:00,828
Victor, come out from
behind that curtain...

429
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:03,749
So my stupid brother
can see you.

430
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,309
Leave me alone.

431
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,430
So you don't want
to see him now, eh ?

432
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,030
You're a cowardy custard.

433
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,070
Cowardy cowardy custard.

434
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,470
I'll just have
to do it myself, then.

435
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,352
That's enough, Victor.

436
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,352
Nicholas. Nicholas.

437
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,753
Tell him to leave
the curtains alone.

438
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,033
He won't listen to me.

439
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:55,393
Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

440
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:57,153
This is our bed.

441
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,873
No, it's mine.

442
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,953
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

443
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:04,594
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

444
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:07,874
Listen, if you don't stop,
I’ll call my mother...

445
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:09,394
And she'll kick you out.

446
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:11,714
You don't know my mother.

447
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:13,394
And you don't know my parents.

448
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,355
Anne, I’m going to tell
mummy about you.

449
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:19,755
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me ?

450
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:23,195
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

451
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:36,356
Mummy! Help!

452
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,637
Help! Help, mummy!

453
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:41,437
What is it? What is it?

454
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:44,237
What is it?

455
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:47,877
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

456
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,318
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me ?

457
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:52,078
I am fed up with you!

458
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:53,758
I didn't do anything!

459
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,118
"Therefore the lord god
sent him forth...

460
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,319
"From the garden of Eden...

461
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,759
"To till the ground
from whence he was taken.

462
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,319
"So he drove out the man...

463
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,119
"And placed to the east
of the garden of Eden...

464
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,599
"Cherubims
and a flaming sword...

465
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,719
"Which turned every way
to keep the way...

466
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,320
"Of the tree of life. "

467
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,040
There. I finished.

468
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
Very good.

469
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,600
Now you can ask the virgin
for forgiveness.

470
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,961
What?
That's not what we agreed!

471
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,921
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

472
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,921
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

473
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,001
You can't make me
ask the virgin for forgiveness.

474
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,481
How dare you!

475
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:40,722
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

476
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,882
You told your brother
someone else was in the room!

477
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:44,362
- There was!
- You're lying!

478
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:45,962
I am not!

479
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:49,122
Anne...

480
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:53,163
Do you remember the story
about Justus and pastor?

481
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:56,283
Children who don't tell
the truth end up in limbo.

482
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:59,163
That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

483
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:02,164
That limbo's only for children
who haven't been baptized.

484
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:05,644
And I have!

485
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:08,084
"And Abraham took the wood...

486
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:12,284
"Of the burnt offering
and laid it upon Isaac his son.

487
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:16,205
"And he took the fire
in his hand and a knife...

488
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,445
"And they went,
both of them together.

489
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:21,485
"And Isaac spake
unto Abraham his father...

490
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:23,645
"And said,’ my father...'

491
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,286
"And he said,
'here I am, my son. "'

492
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,207
Did you look in on Nicholas ?

493
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:48,087
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

494
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,448
What about Anne ?

495
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:52,208
Is she still on the stairs ?

496
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:55,048
Oh, yes, ma'am.

497
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:57,008
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her...

498
00:29:57,048 --> 00:30:00,248
But I can't embroider
in such poor light.

499
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,209
How long is this punishment
going to go on ?

500
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,209
It's been three days now.

501
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:08,809
It's up to her.

502
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:12,529
She's got to learn
to swallow her pride...

503
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:15,010
And ask for forgiveness.

504
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,930
Anyway, it's time
she stared to read the bible.

505
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,450
The priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

506
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,410
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

507
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,611
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

508
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,011
He told me yesterday...

509
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:30,931
He'd be by
as soon as possible.

510
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:34,771
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

511
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,732
This fog doesn't exactly help.

512
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,372
It's never lasted
this long before.

513
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,572
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

514
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,892
Even the seagulls
have gone quiet.

515
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,733
Anne!

516
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:51,453
Anne, I can't hear you.

517
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:58,453
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I’ve
had to put up with the noise...

518
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,494
Of Lydia running around
above my head.

519
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:02,174
She's been hurling
backwards and forwards...

520
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,294
As if there were three of her.

521
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,054
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

522
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,894
To kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

523
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,774
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

524
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:13,655
I'll tell her, ma'am.

525
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:15,695
Thank you.

526
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,499
Now she's really gone too far.

527
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,579
Lydia! Lydia!

528
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:30,381
"... In the mount
of the lord it shall be seen.

529
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:32,101
"And the angel of the lord-- "

530
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:33,701
What's going on up there ?

531
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,222
Nothing, mummy.
I'm just reading.

532
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:40,702
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

533
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:45,902
"And the angel of the lord...

534
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:48,023
"Called unto Abraham
out of heaven...

535
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,023
"The second time and said...

536
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,503
"'By myself, I have sworn,'
saith the lord-- "

537
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,823
Shh!

538
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,264
What was that?

539
00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:06,784
I don't know.

540
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:10,064
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

541
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,025
I can't tell you, mummy.

542
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:14,225
You tell me.

543
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,025
I told you
there was someone in the room...

544
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:17,945
And you punished me.

545
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:19,265
Now I don't know what to say.

546
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:22,745
Anne, I want the truth.

547
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,146
Tell me if
there is someone upstairs.

548
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,746
There. In that junk room.

549
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,430
Mummy, you're letting
the light in.

550
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:21,756
Shh!

551
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:24,436
- She's a woman.
- She's what?

552
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,278
Where did they go ?

553
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,478
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them ?

554
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,078
Which way did they go ?

555
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:56,478
Over there, over there,
and down there as well.

556
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:06,159
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

557
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,880
And they're going
to take the curtains down.

558
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
Ma'am, stay calm, please.

559
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,480
I will not stay calm!

560
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,440
For five whole years
during the occupation...

561
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,040
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
stepping foot in this house...

562
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,841
And now there is someone here,
opening and closing the doors.

563
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,841
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

564
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,881
The floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks--

565
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:29,801
There were voices.
I'm telling you.

566
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:31,281
Mummy, look.

567
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,841
A boy and two women,
talking together.

568
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:34,562
Mummy, look!

569
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,362
I did it yesterday.

570
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:40,122
This is the father,
this is the mother...

571
00:36:40,162 --> 00:36:43,482
This is Victor,
and this is the old woman.

572
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:45,403
What do these numbers stand for?

573
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:47,683
That's the number
of times I’ve seen them.

574
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:50,203
I've seen the old woman
the most.

575
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,523
Oh, god in heaven.

576
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:57,804
Mrs. Mills,
go and call Mr. Tuttle.

577
00:36:57,844 --> 00:37:00,324
We have to search
the whole house immediately...

578
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:01,604
Before it gets dark.

579
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:03,564
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.
- Mummy!

580
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:04,924
Yes, darling. It's all right.

581
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:08,364
Nothing will happen to you
while mummy's here.

582
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:11,565
Look, mummy.
She really scares me.

583
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,845
It's as if
she's not looking at you...

584
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:14,365
But she can see you.

585
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:17,365
And she's always around
saying "come with me "--

586
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:19,125
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

587
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:21,886
Honestly, mummy.
And she asks me things.

588
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:23,806
Victor told me she's a witch.

589
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,246
What does she ask you?

590
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,246
Things.

591
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:32,006
Her breath smells.

592
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,047
We have to open
all the curtains.

593
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,327
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

594
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,727
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,247
You both search the right side,
and I’ll take the left.

596
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,168
Then we'll search upstairs.

597
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:57,894
Perhaps they're ghosts...

598
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,134
Who lived
in this house before.

599
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,694
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

600
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:04,294
Ghosts go about
in white sheets...

601
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:07,054
And carry chains
and go "ooo. "

602
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,375
Now, Anne.

603
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:10,975
Why do you make up
such stories ?

604
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,055
I don't.
I read them in books.

605
00:39:13,175 --> 00:39:15,015
Well, you shouldn't
believe everything...

606
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:16,255
That you read in books.

607
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:17,855
That's what our mother says.

608
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:21,456
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

609
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:23,456
And then she expects us...

610
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,656
To believe everything
written in the bible.

611
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,216
And don't you believe it?

612
00:39:27,256 --> 00:39:28,456
I believe some things.

613
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,816
But, for example,
I don't believe...

614
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:33,497
That god made the world
in seven days.

615
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,217
And I don't believe
that Noah...

616
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,457
Got all those animals
into one boat...

617
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:40,097
Or the holy spirit is a dove.

618
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,417
No, I don't
believe that, either.

619
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,218
Doves are anything but holy.

620
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:45,858
They poo on our windows.

621
00:39:51,578 --> 00:39:55,219
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

622
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:02,784
Ma'am.

623
00:41:02,824 --> 00:41:04,464
Yes ?

624
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,825
They've searched
everywhere, ma'am.

625
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,425
There's no one.

626
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,225
I see.

627
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:15,025
Mrs. Mills.

628
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:16,665
Yes, ma'am ?

629
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:19,586
Do you have any idea
what this might be ?

630
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:23,466
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.

631
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:24,986
No, but look.
They're all asleep.

632
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,106
Look.

633
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,826
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

634
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:33,347
'Tis a book of the dead.

635
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:35,307
In the last century,
I believe...

636
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:37,267
They used to take
photographs of the dead...

637
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:39,227
In the hopes
that their souls...

638
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,068
Would go on living
through the portraits.

639
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,148
There are even
group portraits.

640
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:50,228
And children!

641
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:52,988
Oh, it's macabre!

642
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:57,389
How could these people
be so superstitious ?

643
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:59,749
Grief over the death
of a loved one...

644
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:03,989
Can lead people to do
the strangest things.

645
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,350
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

646
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,270
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,471
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

648
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:27,751
Why don't you come
and sit by the fire ?

649
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:42,393
Thank you very much, ma'am.

650
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:46,273
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

651
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:48,553
Did you have
to look after children then ?

652
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:52,993
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

653
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,714
Hmm.
Were there many servants ?

654
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:59,674
Oh, about fifteen.

655
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:00,994
Though in the end...

656
00:43:01,034 --> 00:43:03,274
There were just
the three of us left.

657
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,634
Why?

658
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:06,955
My employers moved to London.

659
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:10,955
They came here
less and less...

660
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:13,195
It being
so out of the way like.

661
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:17,596
So gradually the house
just became empty.

662
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:22,436
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

663
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:25,756
My family left
in the summer of 1 940....

664
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:29,237
Just before the invasion.

665
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:31,557
That was the last
I’ve heard of them.

666
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,837
I don't blame them.

667
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:42,438
Actually, we left, too.

668
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:44,238
Although, you know...

669
00:43:44,278 --> 00:43:46,358
Sometimes when
you leave a place...

670
00:43:46,398 --> 00:43:50,958
It's like it's there
with you all the time.

671
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:54,639
I always felt like I
never left this house.

672
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,959
Why did you leave ?

673
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,279
Oh,it was on account
of the tuberculosis.

674
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:02,599
The whole area was evacuated.

675
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,400
Was that when Lydia went dumb ?

676
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,360
Yes, I think so...

677
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,240
Though my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

678
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,960
What happened to her?

679
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:24,321
It was suddenly one day.

680
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,362
She just... stopped talking.

681
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:31,362
There must've been a reason.

682
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,842
People don't just stop talking.

683
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,322
These things
are always the result...

684
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:38,562
Of some sort of trauma.

685
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,723
Something
must've happened to her.

686
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:46,683
Did your employers
treat you well?

687
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:48,683
Oh, they were always
very kind to us.

688
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:51,763
They treated us
just like family.

689
00:44:54,044 --> 00:44:57,444
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

690
00:44:57,484 --> 00:45:00,204
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

691
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:01,844
Off you go.

692
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:03,724
I'm going to stay here
a while longer.

693
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:05,405
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:43,208
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

695
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,889
Can you forgive me ?

696
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:59,089
Anne.

697
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:19,251
Mummy.

698
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:20,531
What?

699
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,971
When's daddy coming home ?

700
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:26,451
When the war's over.

701
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,612
Why did he go to war?

702
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:33,532
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

703
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:35,492
Daddy went...

704
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:42,213
Daddy went
because he's very brave...

705
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:44,293
And because
he wasn't prepared...

706
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,893
To let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

707
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,573
Why?

708
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,854
Charles...

709
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:02,975
Where are you?

710
00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:53,109
Mrs. Mills!

711
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:55,069
Mrs. Mills!

712
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:57,909
What's the matter, ma'am ?

713
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:01,550
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

714
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:04,190
- What's happening, ma'am ?
- Come on!

715
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:15,511
Oh, my god.

716
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:20,351
I checked that room myself.

717
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:24,311
It was empty.

718
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:27,112
Take these tablets, ma'am.

719
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,072
They'll do you good.

720
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:32,352
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

721
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:36,072
And it wasn't human.

722
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:39,433
There is something
in this house.

723
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,353
Something diabolic.

724
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:42,873
Ma'am...

725
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:45,913
Something which is not...

726
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:50,434
Not at rest.

727
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:56,354
I know you don't believe it.

728
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:59,034
You don't believe it, do you?

729
00:50:59,074 --> 00:51:00,434
I don't blame you.

730
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,555
I used to not believe
these things.

731
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:09,395
I do believe it, ma'am.

732
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:14,036
I've always believed
in those things.

733
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:16,316
They're not easy to explain...

734
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:18,036
But they do happen.

735
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:23,036
We've all heard stories
of... the beyond...

736
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,037
Now and then...

737
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:33,277
And I think sometimes
the world of the dead...

738
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:37,078
Gets mixed up
with the world of the living.

739
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:40,078
But it's impossible.

740
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:42,438
The lord would never allow
such an aberration.

741
00:51:42,478 --> 00:51:43,678
The living and the dead...

742
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:47,838
Will only meet
at the end of eternity.

743
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:50,599
It says so in the bible.

744
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:52,999
Ma'am...

745
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,959
There isn't always
an answer for everything.

746
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,000
Where are you off to, ma'am ?

747
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,921
I'm going to the village
to pay father McGraw a visit.

748
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:16,041
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

749
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:17,401
I shall bring him back.

750
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:19,561
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

751
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:21,441
I've waited long enough.

752
00:52:21,481 --> 00:52:23,641
Ma'am,
the priest told me that--

753
00:52:23,722 --> 00:52:25,882
I don't care
what he told you!

754
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:28,042
I want him to tell me
personally!

755
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:29,682
He must come today!

756
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:31,522
But what are you
going to tell him ?

757
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:34,242
That we have searched
every room inch by inch...

758
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:36,963
And now I need them
to be blessed.

759
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,523
Ma'am, please, wait.

760
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:41,963
Still, it's very early.

761
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:44,243
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

762
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:47,283
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

763
00:52:47,323 --> 00:52:48,564
Gravestones ?

764
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:49,964
Yes. When my husband
bought this house...

765
00:52:50,044 --> 00:52:51,884
We were told
there was a little cemetery.

766
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:54,324
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

767
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:55,564
I've not seen anything.

768
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:58,684
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

769
00:52:58,724 --> 00:53:00,005
Yes, ma'am.

770
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:02,405
I need to know if there was
a family buried here...

771
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,165
And if they had
a little boy-- Victor.

772
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:23,567
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

773
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:26,287
Do you think
it's safe to let her go ?

774
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:29,727
Oh, don't worry. The fog
won't let her get very far.

775
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,367
Oh, yes, the fog.

776
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,887
The fog, of course.

777
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:35,528
And when do you think...

778
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:38,928
We should bring
all this out into the open ?

779
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,848
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

780
00:53:40,928 --> 00:53:43,328
All in good time.

781
00:53:43,368 --> 00:53:45,928
Speaking of which.

782
00:54:55,894 --> 00:54:57,254
Wha--

783
00:55:39,778 --> 00:55:42,178
Charles ?

784
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:43,538
Grace ?

785
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,980
You're here. You're here.

786
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,140
They said there was no hope.

787
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,380
They said I should
give you up for dead.

788
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,060
They say a lot of things.

789
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:16,181
Oh, thank you.

790
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:17,781
Thank you, god.

791
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,381
Thank you, god.

792
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:22,542
Every night I prayed for this...

793
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:25,062
Begging god to bring you back.

794
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:29,342
Bring the children
their father back.

795
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:30,942
Bring him...

796
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:36,623
But where have you been
all this time ?

797
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:41,303
Out there...
looking for my home.

798
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,304
You're so different.

799
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:53,424
So different.

800
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:56,224
Sometimes I bleed.

801
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:34,748
Ma'am--

802
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:40,508
Mrs. Mills...

803
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:42,628
This is my husband.

804
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:48,429
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir.

805
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,469
He's very weak.

806
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,749
Here.

807
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:57,390
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

808
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,630
And something to eat.

809
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,310
Right away, ma'am.

810
00:58:20,472 --> 00:58:22,512
How are my little ones ?

811
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:26,032
Daddy!

812
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:31,592
Why did you take so long?

813
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,873
Hello, Nicholas.

814
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,273
I told you, you see.

815
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:42,993
I told you he'd come back.

816
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:52,034
Have you both been well behaved?

817
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:53,794
We've been very good.

818
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,274
Have you been good
to your mother?

819
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:56,595
Very good.

820
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:59,875
We study every day
for our first communion.

821
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:03,515
Daddy, did you kill anyone ?

822
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:11,156
Oh! Here he comes!

823
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:17,956
Darling,
we've prepared lunch for you.

824
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:20,237
Are you coming down
or would you prefer--

825
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:34,478
When's daddy coming down ?

826
00:59:34,558 --> 00:59:38,478
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.

827
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:40,518
He said he'd seen
a lot of dead men.

828
00:59:40,598 --> 00:59:42,318
Shh.

829
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:48,159
Mummy, when people die
in the war...

830
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,399
Where do they go ?

831
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,359
Oh, what a question.

832
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:55,239
- It depends.
- On what?

833
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,880
Whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

834
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,520
Your father, for example,
fought for England...

835
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,640
On the side of the goodies.

836
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,121
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are ?

837
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:11,041
That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

838
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:12,721
You'll never go to war.

839
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:14,721
We'll never go anywhere.

840
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:20,002
You're not missing out
on anything.

841
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:22,522
You're much better off at home
with your mummy and daddy...

842
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:24,602
Who love you very, very much.

843
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:27,922
And the intruders.

844
01:00:29,602 --> 01:00:32,163
There are no intruders here.

845
01:00:32,203 --> 01:00:34,323
But you said that there were.

846
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:35,803
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

847
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:37,763
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

848
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:40,403
- But you said--
- That is enough!

849
01:00:40,443 --> 01:00:42,643
Can I say something?

850
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,924
- No!
- Why not?

851
01:00:44,004 --> 01:00:46,604
Because you can't!

852
01:00:52,364 --> 01:00:54,845
Anne, stop breathing like that.

853
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,845
You heard me. Stop it.

854
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:04,245
Stop breathing.

855
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:08,326
Right, you go to your room.

856
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:12,406
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.

857
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:20,447
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.

858
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:22,447
Oh, stop that here.

859
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,927
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

860
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:29,567
- I don't care!
- There, there.

861
01:01:29,607 --> 01:01:32,968
You listen to me.

862
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:35,328
I've seen them, too.

863
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:37,608
You have ?

864
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:40,168
Yes.

865
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,969
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

866
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:46,129
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

867
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:49,209
She only believes
in what she was taught.

868
01:01:49,249 --> 01:01:53,969
But don't worry,
sooner or later...

869
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:56,050
She'll see them.

870
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,330
Then everything
will be different.

871
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,210
How?

872
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,610
Oh, you'll see.

873
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:07,371
There are going to be
some big surprises.

874
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:12,091
There are going to be...
changes.

875
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:14,131
Changes ?

876
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:30,013
Now she's behaving
as if nothing had happened.

877
01:02:30,053 --> 01:02:32,333
What about her daughter?

878
01:02:32,413 --> 01:02:34,573
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

879
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:37,813
The children will be
easier to convince.

880
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:42,934
No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

881
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:46,894
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

882
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:51,694
No. I don't think
he even knows where he is.

883
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:10,616
Ohh, look what
a pretty daughter I’ve got.

884
01:03:12,336 --> 01:03:16,616
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

885
01:03:16,656 --> 01:03:19,417
- Hmm ?
- I look like a bride.

886
01:03:20,617 --> 01:03:23,777
Yes. You do.

887
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:31,098
I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

888
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:33,538
- You can take it off now.
- No.

889
01:03:33,578 --> 01:03:35,738
This dress has to be spotless
for your first communion.

890
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,298
I promise I won't dirty it.

891
01:03:37,338 --> 01:03:40,338
Just let me wear it
for a little longer.

892
01:03:40,378 --> 01:03:42,859
Oh, just a little ?

893
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:47,539
All right.
I'll be back shortly.

894
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,019
No sitting on the floor
or leaning against the walls.

895
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,379
No.

896
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:10,341
Monsieur,
would you like to dance ?

897
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,101
I'd love to.

898
01:04:38,103 --> 01:04:40,263
Charles,
you can't go on like this.

899
01:04:40,303 --> 01:04:43,224
You must eat something.

900
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:49,104
Oooo.

901
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:07,266
<i>in the sky </i>

902
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:12,266
<i>I don't know if
it's cloudy or bright</i>

903
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:17,987
<i>but I only have eyes</i>

904
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:22,827
<i>for you, dear</i>

905
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:27,187
<i>the moon may be high</i>

906
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,430
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

907
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:08,191
Anne, are you listening to me ?

908
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:11,191
Anne ?

909
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:18,152
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

910
01:06:18,232 --> 01:06:19,632
But it's clean.

911
01:06:19,672 --> 01:06:20,952
It makes no difference.

912
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:23,872
Why can't you ever do
as you're told...

913
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:48,754
What's the matter?

914
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:50,954
Where is my daughter?

915
01:06:53,395 --> 01:06:56,555
What have you done
with my daughter?

916
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,915
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

917
01:06:59,955 --> 01:07:02,755
No! You're not my daughter!

918
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:07,836
No! No!

919
01:07:09,156 --> 01:07:11,516
You're not my daughter! No!

920
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:13,117
- No!

921
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:27,118
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

922
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:28,558
She wants to kill me!

923
01:07:28,638 --> 01:07:31,078
She won't stop
until she kills us!

924
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:33,278
She won't stop!

925
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:34,918
Hush, child.
Come with me.

926
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,318
You're wicked!
You're wicked! Wicked!

927
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,839
Wicked!

928
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:51,840
How is she ?

929
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,440
There's no calming her...

930
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,160
So I’ve left her
with her father.

931
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,680
She insisted
on speaking with him.

932
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,081
What happened?
Why did you fight?

933
01:08:06,121 --> 01:08:07,881
It wasn't her.

934
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:12,441
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

935
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,802
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

936
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:19,402
I'd swear to god
that it wasn't my daughter.

937
01:08:19,442 --> 01:08:24,042
Oh, god. God help me.

938
01:08:24,082 --> 01:08:27,483
God help me.
What's the matter with me ?

939
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:30,043
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

940
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:32,643
You must get more rest.

941
01:08:35,043 --> 01:08:39,484
You can't take on the whole
responsibility of this house.

942
01:08:39,524 --> 01:08:41,044
Leave it to us.

943
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:43,564
We know what has to be done.

944
01:08:46,804 --> 01:08:48,604
What do you mean by that?

945
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,405
What do you mean
you know what has to be done ?

946
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:54,285
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting--

947
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:57,205
There's nothing to suggest.

948
01:08:57,245 --> 01:08:58,725
Who do you think you are ?

949
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:00,685
You have no idea
what has to be done.

950
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:07,006
Or do you?

951
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,846
What are these ?

952
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:18,767
The tablets
for your migraine, ma'am.

953
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:20,607
The ones you always take.

954
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:24,247
Please,
I need to be on my own.

955
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:26,848
Yes, ma'am.

956
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,250
Come, child.

957
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:17,372
Anne told me everything.

958
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:26,733
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

959
01:10:26,773 --> 01:10:29,133
At first, I thought there
was someone else in the house.

960
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:30,693
Even thought there were ghosts.

961
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:33,573
I'm not talking about
the ghosts.

962
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:36,653
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

963
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:45,574
I don't know what
you're talking about.

964
01:10:45,614 --> 01:10:47,574
Tell me it's not true.

965
01:10:47,614 --> 01:10:50,495
Tell me what happened.

966
01:10:50,535 --> 01:10:54,495
Happened?

967
01:10:57,855 --> 01:11:01,296
I don't know
what came over me that day.

968
01:11:01,336 --> 01:11:05,096
The servants had left
during the night.

969
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,816
Hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

970
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:16,817
They knew that I couldn't
leave the house.

971
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:21,337
They knew.

972
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,177
Anne.

973
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:27,298
Anne, what happened?

974
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:31,378
She hit me.

975
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:34,858
She went mad
like she did that day.

976
01:11:34,938 --> 01:11:38,339
Do you remember?

977
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:40,579
No.

978
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:45,859
You must forgive me, Charles.

979
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:49,580
Not me. The children.

980
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:53,140
They know that I love them.

981
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,620
They know I’d never hurt them.

982
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,860
I'd die first.

983
01:12:01,341 --> 01:12:04,101
What are you going to do ?

984
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:07,061
Are you angry with me ?

985
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:12,142
I just came back
to say goodbye...

986
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:13,822
To my wife and children.

987
01:12:13,902 --> 01:12:16,222
Now I must go.

988
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:18,062
Go where ?

989
01:12:18,102 --> 01:12:20,902
To the front.

990
01:12:20,942 --> 01:12:22,382
No. The war's over.

991
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,263
The war is not over.

992
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:28,703
What are you talking about?

993
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:30,823
You're not going,
do you hear me ?

994
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:33,103
You left us once already.
You can't go!

995
01:12:33,143 --> 01:12:36,144
Why?

996
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:39,024
Why did you have
to go to that stupid war...

997
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,584
That had nothing to do with us ?

998
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:44,584
Why couldn't you have
stayed here like the others ?

999
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:45,824
The others surrendered.

1000
01:12:45,864 --> 01:12:47,785
We all surrendered!

1001
01:12:47,825 --> 01:12:51,225
The whole island was occupied!

1002
01:12:51,265 --> 01:12:53,825
What did you expect?

1003
01:12:58,225 --> 01:13:01,586
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

1004
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:04,346
Your place was here with us.

1005
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:08,026
With your family.

1006
01:13:12,707 --> 01:13:16,747
I loved you.

1007
01:13:16,787 --> 01:13:19,627
That was enough for me.

1008
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:24,148
Living in this darkness...

1009
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:26,628
In this prison.

1010
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:32,228
But not for you.

1011
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:35,749
I wasn't enough for you.

1012
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,509
That's why you left.

1013
01:13:40,269 --> 01:13:42,549
It wasn't just the war.

1014
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:48,990
You want to leave me, don't you?

1015
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,920
Anne!

1016
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,361
Nicholas!

1017
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:11,562
What is it? What--

1018
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:19,122
Oh, my god!

1019
01:16:19,202 --> 01:16:22,643
Here! Oh, my god!

1020
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,323
Here!

1021
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:43,204
Where are the curtains ?

1022
01:16:47,925 --> 01:16:50,485
Mrs. Mills!

1023
01:17:05,206 --> 01:17:08,046
Let me see. Let me see.

1024
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,327
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!

1025
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:14,927
I want my daddy!

1026
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:20,207
Daddy's gone.

1027
01:17:20,247 --> 01:17:22,408
It's not true!

1028
01:17:22,448 --> 01:17:25,448
Yes, it is.

1029
01:17:25,528 --> 01:17:27,968
It is true.

1030
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:31,768
I love you, mummy.

1031
01:17:38,849 --> 01:17:41,729
Find the curtains.

1032
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,370
Who was it?

1033
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,650
Who did this ?

1034
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,290
Tell me!

1035
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,010
Tell me!

1036
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,330
You know what's happening here!

1037
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,650
You know because
it happened to you, too!

1038
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,851
You'll tell me.

1039
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:00,411
You write it down.

1040
01:18:00,451 --> 01:18:03,451
Write it down! Please!

1041
01:18:03,491 --> 01:18:06,211
That attitude won't solve
anything, ma'am.

1042
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:09,012
Anyway, she can't write.

1043
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:11,292
- Where are they?
- What?

1044
01:18:11,332 --> 01:18:12,732
The curtains!

1045
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,652
The curtains
my children's lives depend on!

1046
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,172
Someone has taken the curtains!

1047
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:18,492
I have noticed, ma'am.

1048
01:18:18,572 --> 01:18:21,613
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

1049
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:25,013
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just
on the point of calling you.

1050
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:29,053
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains ?

1051
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:32,333
The curtains ?

1052
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,894
Oh, dear.

1053
01:18:34,974 --> 01:18:38,494
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains ?

1054
01:18:38,534 --> 01:18:42,454
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1055
01:18:42,494 --> 01:18:45,695
Daylight. Of course.

1056
01:18:45,775 --> 01:18:48,055
Someone wants to kill
my children.

1057
01:18:48,095 --> 01:18:51,015
Why do you think that
the daylight would kill them ?

1058
01:18:51,055 --> 01:18:54,575
Are you mad?

1059
01:18:54,655 --> 01:18:57,096
I told you.

1060
01:18:57,136 --> 01:18:58,776
I already told you!

1061
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:02,176
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1062
01:19:02,216 --> 01:19:04,736
Yes, but that was before.

1063
01:19:04,776 --> 01:19:07,696
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1064
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:10,377
If you never
expose them to daylight...

1065
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,097
How do you know
they're not cured?

1066
01:19:12,177 --> 01:19:16,977
My sister-in-law had terrible
attacks of rheumatism...

1067
01:19:17,017 --> 01:19:19,217
In her legs and back.

1068
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:22,098
Then one fine day...

1069
01:19:23,378 --> 01:19:25,378
They disappeared.

1070
01:19:26,858 --> 01:19:28,658
I am going
to find those curtains...

1071
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:30,938
And when you have finished
helping me hang them...

1072
01:19:30,978 --> 01:19:33,019
You will leave this house!

1073
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,300
And what about the master,
ma'am ?

1074
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,300
What has he got to say
about all of this ?

1075
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:53,580
Give me your keys.

1076
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,540
I want your keys now!

1077
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:02,221
I know what you want.

1078
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:03,901
You want to frighten us.

1079
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:06,061
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1080
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:07,301
You've wanted
to take over this house...

1081
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:09,302
Ever since the first day
you arrived.

1082
01:20:09,342 --> 01:20:13,342
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

1083
01:20:13,382 --> 01:20:15,102
You should
try and calm down, ma'am.

1084
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:18,222
Give me the keys.

1085
01:20:19,343 --> 01:20:20,823
Give them to me.

1086
01:20:27,183 --> 01:20:29,183
And now get out of here.

1087
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:49,865
You know something, Mr. Tuttle ?

1088
01:20:49,905 --> 01:20:53,025
I think I’ve reached
the end of my tether.

1089
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:55,226
What about you?

1090
01:20:55,266 --> 01:21:00,026
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1091
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:03,586
We'd better go and uncover
the gravestones.

1092
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:43,950
What's mummy doing?

1093
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:46,230
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

1094
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,670
Liar.

1095
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:52,870
- She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1096
01:21:58,151 --> 01:22:00,111
Night time.

1097
01:22:00,191 --> 01:22:02,711
Where are you going?

1098
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,791
I've had enough.

1099
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:08,072
I'm going into the woods
to look for daddy.

1100
01:22:08,152 --> 01:22:10,832
Are you going to run away?

1101
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:15,952
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1102
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:17,872
It's very easy.

1103
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:34,554
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

1104
01:22:34,594 --> 01:22:36,834
Yes, yes, yes.

1105
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:48,155
Anne, wait!

1106
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:50,435
I want to come and look
for daddy, too.

1107
01:22:50,475 --> 01:22:53,795
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1108
01:22:53,876 --> 01:22:55,396
Scaredy pants, scaredy pants!

1109
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:56,676
Be quiet!

1110
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,720
Anne, I think we got lost.

1111
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,881
We still haven't
left the garden yet, silly.

1112
01:23:55,921 --> 01:23:59,881
- I'm scared.
- Shouldn't have come, then.

1113
01:24:02,961 --> 01:24:06,042
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1114
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:08,522
I don't know. Anything.

1115
01:24:08,562 --> 01:24:11,842
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I’m walking.

1116
01:24:11,882 --> 01:24:13,922
I'm walking
and my name is Anne.

1117
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:43,325
What's that over there ?

1118
01:24:44,405 --> 01:24:46,845
I think they're graves.

1119
01:24:47,845 --> 01:24:49,485
Don't go near!

1120
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:51,165
Why not?

1121
01:24:51,205 --> 01:24:53,566
What if a ghost jumps out?

1122
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:56,726
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

1123
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:15,247
There's something written here.

1124
01:25:15,287 --> 01:25:16,768
Let's go!

1125
01:25:16,808 --> 01:25:19,168
Wait!

1126
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:44,290
Anne! What does it say?

1127
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:54,291
You must be
strong now, children.

1128
01:25:54,331 --> 01:25:56,731
Nicholas, come here!

1129
01:25:56,771 --> 01:26:00,211
Mrs. Mills, please don't
tell mummy we've run away.

1130
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:01,491
Don't speak to them!

1131
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:03,531
Why?

1132
01:26:03,611 --> 01:26:05,932
- They're dead!
- What?

1133
01:26:05,972 --> 01:26:07,972
They're ghosts!
Please come here!

1134
01:26:08,012 --> 01:26:10,292
Children!

1135
01:26:10,372 --> 01:26:12,252
Nicholas!

1136
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,932
They're ghosts ?

1137
01:26:13,972 --> 01:26:16,413
Why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains ?

1138
01:26:16,453 --> 01:26:17,893
You said that--

1139
01:26:17,933 --> 01:26:20,293
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1140
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:23,333
You're always teasing me
and telling lies...

1141
01:26:23,373 --> 01:26:24,813
And I’m sick of it!

1142
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,933
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!

1143
01:26:27,013 --> 01:26:29,334
Come here!

1144
01:26:31,174 --> 01:26:32,934
Quick!

1145
01:26:32,974 --> 01:26:36,494
Aah! Mum! Mum!

1146
01:26:36,534 --> 01:26:39,254
Children!

1147
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:46,335
Run!

1148
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:47,855
Run!

1149
01:26:47,895 --> 01:26:51,295
Go! Into the house!

1150
01:26:52,696 --> 01:26:55,456
Don't come any closer!

1151
01:26:55,496 --> 01:26:58,456
Don't move!

1152
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:03,897
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1153
01:27:03,937 --> 01:27:06,857
Tuberculosis finished us off...

1154
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:09,617
More than half a century ago.

1155
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:31,099
Go away!

1156
01:27:37,659 --> 01:27:39,220
Open the door, ma'am. Please.

1157
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,540
What do you want?

1158
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,260
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.

1159
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,460
We've seen their graves.

1160
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,380
Go upstairs and hide.

1161
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,380
- Go on.
- I'm scared.

1162
01:27:55,941 --> 01:27:58,001
Don't separate!

1163
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:08,142
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1164
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:12,422
Go hide. Go. Go.

1165
01:28:12,462 --> 01:28:15,183
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1166
01:28:17,743 --> 01:28:19,503
Understand what?

1167
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:21,023
About the house.

1168
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,783
About the new situation.

1169
01:28:23,823 --> 01:28:25,983
What situation ?

1170
01:28:26,023 --> 01:28:30,384
We must all learn
to live together...

1171
01:28:30,384 --> 01:28:31,624
The living and the dead.

1172
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:37,184
If you're dead,
leave us in peace!

1173
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:39,745
Oh. Leave us in peace!

1174
01:28:39,825 --> 01:28:43,065
Leave us in peace!

1175
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:50,746
In here. Get inside.

1176
01:28:55,786 --> 01:28:58,066
And suppose we do leave you.

1177
01:28:58,106 --> 01:29:00,306
Do you think they will?

1178
01:29:00,386 --> 01:29:01,826
Who ?

1179
01:29:01,866 --> 01:29:03,947
The intruders.

1180
01:29:03,987 --> 01:29:06,227
There are no intruders.

1181
01:29:06,267 --> 01:29:07,587
They took the curtains down.

1182
01:29:07,627 --> 01:29:08,987
There are no intruders.

1183
01:29:09,027 --> 01:29:11,667
Oh, yes,
I assure you it was them.

1184
01:29:11,707 --> 01:29:15,748
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

1185
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:18,188
- Waiting for you.
- No!

1186
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:22,628
Yes. And believe me,
sooner or later...

1187
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:25,148
They'll find you.

1188
01:29:25,228 --> 01:29:27,109
Listen, wait here,
and I’ll be back in a minute.

1189
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:30,109
No, no, no. Mummy said
we shouldn't separate.

1190
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:32,109
We can't leave her on her own.

1191
01:29:36,429 --> 01:29:39,230
Stop breathing like that.

1192
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,150
Nicholas,
stop breathing like that.

1193
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:53,711
Stop breathing!

1194
01:29:55,671 --> 01:30:00,471
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.

1195
01:30:02,952 --> 01:30:05,672
Come with us, children.

1196
01:30:05,752 --> 01:30:08,752
Come with us.

1197
01:30:15,073 --> 01:30:16,753
Nicholas ?

1198
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,193
Anne ?

1199
01:30:22,753 --> 01:30:24,753
Where are you?

1200
01:30:27,634 --> 01:30:29,634
Answer me!

1201
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,034
The intruders have found them.

1202
01:30:31,114 --> 01:30:33,674
There's nothing we can do now.

1203
01:30:33,714 --> 01:30:38,955
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

1204
01:30:56,236 --> 01:30:59,036
Our father,
who art in heaven...

1205
01:30:59,076 --> 01:31:01,237
Hallowed be thy name.

1206
01:31:01,277 --> 01:31:03,157
Thy kingdom come...

1207
01:31:03,197 --> 01:31:05,357
Thy will be done on earth...

1208
01:31:05,437 --> 01:31:08,077
As it is in heaven.

1209
01:31:08,117 --> 01:31:10,557
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1210
01:31:10,557 --> 01:31:12,197
And forgive us
our trespasses...

1211
01:31:15,598 --> 01:31:18,398
Why are you afraid, children ?

1212
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:21,478
Why don't you want us
to be your friends ?

1213
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:27,239
Come on. Speak to us.

1214
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,639
Speak to us.

1215
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:37,320
Tell me what happened.

1216
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,840
Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!

1217
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,640
"Don't tell her. "

1218
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:50,241
If I tell her, they'll
leave us in peace.

1219
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:52,641
Mummy!

1220
01:31:54,561 --> 01:31:56,121
"Mummy. "

1221
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:59,601
Why are you crying, children ?

1222
01:31:59,641 --> 01:32:03,002
What happened in this room ?

1223
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:07,602
What did your mother do to you?

1224
01:32:18,363 --> 01:32:20,643
Something about a pillow.

1225
01:32:20,723 --> 01:32:24,284
Is that how she killed you?

1226
01:32:25,644 --> 01:32:27,164
With a pillow?

1227
01:32:27,204 --> 01:32:28,564
She didn't kill us!

1228
01:32:28,604 --> 01:32:30,124
Children, if you're dead...

1229
01:32:30,164 --> 01:32:32,764
Why do you remain in this house ?

1230
01:32:32,804 --> 01:32:34,764
We're not dead!

1231
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,845
Why do you remain
in this house ?

1232
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,125
We're not dead!

1233
01:32:39,205 --> 01:32:40,485
We're not dead!

1234
01:32:40,525 --> 01:32:43,445
We're not dead!

1235
01:32:43,485 --> 01:32:46,565
Why do you remain
in this house ?

1236
01:32:46,605 --> 01:32:50,366
"We're not dead.
We're not dead. "

1237
01:32:50,406 --> 01:32:54,886
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1238
01:32:55,966 --> 01:32:57,846
We're not dead!

1239
01:33:14,008 --> 01:33:15,528
Are you all right?

1240
01:33:15,568 --> 01:33:21,448
Yes. Just a bit dizzy,
that's all.

1241
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:23,328
What happened?

1242
01:33:23,368 --> 01:33:26,489
They made contact.

1243
01:33:26,529 --> 01:33:28,129
All three ?

1244
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:31,169
Apparently, yes.

1245
01:33:31,209 --> 01:33:34,969
The mother
and the two children.

1246
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,690
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

1247
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,690
Interesting?

1248
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,490
I was scared out of my wits!

1249
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:42,050
Darling, calm down.

1250
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:45,050
No. So far, we have handled
this matter your way...

1251
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,770
But now you listen to me.

1252
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:49,211
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

1253
01:33:49,251 --> 01:33:52,691
It is quite clear these beings
do not want us to live here.

1254
01:33:52,731 --> 01:33:54,251
We don't know anything
about them yet.

1255
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:56,171
Yes, we do!

1256
01:33:56,211 --> 01:33:57,931
We know the woman went mad...

1257
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:00,812
Smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1258
01:34:00,852 --> 01:34:04,052
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.

1259
01:34:04,092 --> 01:34:05,892
There's nothing wrong
with Victor.

1260
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:08,732
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.

1261
01:34:08,772 --> 01:34:10,652
He says he has seen that girl...

1262
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:13,093
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1263
01:34:13,133 --> 01:34:16,133
Please,
let us leave this house.

1264
01:34:16,173 --> 01:34:17,453
All right.

1265
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:20,773
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1266
01:34:20,853 --> 01:34:23,294
Oh, thank god for that.

1267
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:27,054
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

1268
01:34:30,054 --> 01:34:32,134
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

1269
01:34:32,174 --> 01:34:33,414
A pleasure.

1270
01:34:33,494 --> 01:34:35,335
I hope we've been of some help.

1271
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:38,415
Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...

1272
01:34:41,975 --> 01:34:45,415
At first,
I couldn't understand...

1273
01:34:45,455 --> 01:34:49,456
What the pillow
was doing in my hands...

1274
01:34:52,216 --> 01:34:55,056
Or why you didn't move.

1275
01:34:58,897 --> 01:35:01,137
But then I knew.

1276
01:35:03,977 --> 01:35:05,977
It had happened.

1277
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:12,298
I had killed my children.

1278
01:35:18,298 --> 01:35:22,579
I got the rifle.

1279
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:24,859
I put it to my forehead.

1280
01:35:29,019 --> 01:35:31,259
Then I pulled the trigger.

1281
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,300
Nothing.

1282
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:48,901
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1283
01:35:51,941 --> 01:35:53,341
You were playing
with the pillows...

1284
01:35:53,381 --> 01:35:55,821
As if nothing had happened.

1285
01:35:57,381 --> 01:36:04,582
And I thought
the lord in his great mercy...

1286
01:36:04,622 --> 01:36:10,543
Was giving me another chance...

1287
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:15,063
Telling me, "don't give up. "

1288
01:36:18,223 --> 01:36:19,863
"Be strong. "

1289
01:36:21,663 --> 01:36:23,384
"Be a good mother. "

1290
01:36:25,824 --> 01:36:27,184
"For them. "

1291
01:36:31,224 --> 01:36:36,305
But now...

1292
01:36:36,345 --> 01:36:37,945
Now...

1293
01:36:41,345 --> 01:36:43,345
What does all this mean ?

1294
01:36:47,906 --> 01:36:49,306
Where are we ?

1295
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:53,826
Young Lydia
said the very same thing...

1296
01:36:53,866 --> 01:36:57,506
When she realized
the three of us were dead.

1297
01:36:58,787 --> 01:37:01,907
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1298
01:37:03,987 --> 01:37:06,907
But I couldn't tell you
that before now.

1299
01:37:11,308 --> 01:37:14,828
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma'am ?

1300
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:20,828
The intruders are leaving...

1301
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:23,189
But others will come.

1302
01:37:23,229 --> 01:37:25,269
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1303
01:37:25,309 --> 01:37:28,909
Other times, we won't.

1304
01:37:28,949 --> 01:37:32,269
But that's the way
it's always been.

1305
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:35,590
Ma'am.

1306
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,550
Mummy...

1307
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,910
Daddy died in the war,
didn't he ?

1308
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,471
Yes.

1309
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:48,271
Will we ever see him again ?

1310
01:37:48,311 --> 01:37:51,231
I don't know.

1311
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:56,071
If we're dead, where's limbo ?

1312
01:38:00,032 --> 01:38:03,032
I don't know
if there even is a limbo.

1313
01:38:05,192 --> 01:38:08,072
I'm no wiser than you are.

1314
01:38:10,233 --> 01:38:14,393
But I do know that I love you.

1315
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:17,233
I've always loved you.

1316
01:38:20,033 --> 01:38:23,034
And this house is ours.

1317
01:38:24,674 --> 01:38:27,834
You say it with me.

1318
01:38:27,874 --> 01:38:29,154
This house is ours.

1319
01:38:29,194 --> 01:38:30,674
This house is ours.

1320
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:32,875
This house is ours.

1321
01:38:53,476 --> 01:38:57,077
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1322
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:10,838
No one can make us
leave this house.

1323
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,600
Come along, Victor.
