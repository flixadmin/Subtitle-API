1
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

2
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,240
You're counting on the Winged Avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,000
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Let's say we flip for it?

9
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
One man is born a hero,
his brother a coward.

10
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Why?

13
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,160
Why, why, why, why, why?

14
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,400
Luck!

15
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

16
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,240
...clueless luck!

17
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
The random toss...

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
...is the only true justice.

19
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Let's see what justice has in store...

20
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
...for you.

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
It's like the touch of God.

22
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,200
In your case, beer and pizza.

25
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,200
Out of here, guys!

26
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,200
-But you said you'd let me live!
-Too true!

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,040
And so you shall! Nothing's better
than live bait to trap a bat.

28
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
Hot entrance.

29
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
Two-Face?

30
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,000
Two guards are dead.

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,400
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.

32
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
We should have.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
The Second Bank of Gotham--

34
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,840
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

35
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
How could he resist?

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm Chase Meridian.

37
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,160
I asked her to come here to consult
on the case. She specializes in--

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
Abnormal psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,720
Insightful.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Naive, but insightful.

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,640
Can we reason with him?

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
-He's got innocent people up there.
-It won't do any good.

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,200
-He'll slaughter them without a thought.
-Agreed.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,720
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves one--

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,640
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

47
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
Exactly.

48
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,880
Like you.

49
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,920
I could write a hell of a paper on a man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,560
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

51
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
Really? I didn't know that.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,280
You are interesting.

53
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,320
And call me Chase.

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,760
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I call you Bats?

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
Let's start this party with a bang!

56
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,240
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!

57
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
Kill the Bat!

58
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
Blast him!

59
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
Open sesame.

60
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,920
It's a trap!

61
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,160
<i>Attention citizens of fair Gotham!</i>

62
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,760
<i>When we open that safe,
we'll have everything we ever wanted:</i>

63
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,160
<i>Enough cash to rain down upon
fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.</i>

64
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200
<i>And, of course...</i>

65
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
<i>...you, my boy, dead!</i>

66
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,440
It's boiling acid!

67
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,320
<i>For your dying pleasure, we are serving
the acid that made us the men we are!</i>

68
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,320
No!

69
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,280
-Hold on.
-Yes!

70
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Haul away!

71
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
Yes! Haul away!

72
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,040
-Give me your hand.
-Don't let go!

73
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,120
I must borrow this.

74
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
That's my hearing aid!

75
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
Thanks.

76
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Wow! My shoes are melting!

77
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,520
No more!

78
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Hang on.

79
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
Hang on?

80
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,120
Get him down.

81
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,520
Get him down.

82
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,360
Take it easy with him.

83
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,840
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.

84
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
This'll fix him!

85
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,760
Hang on, Batty!

86
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Let's see.

87
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes!

88
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!

89
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,800
Farewell forever to that...

90
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,920
...pointy-eared night rat!

91
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
Face!

92
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,880
You need help. Give it up.

93
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Have the good taste to die!

94
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,760
See you!

95
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>Despite a valiant effort
last night by Batman...</i>

96
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,320
<i>...Harvey Two-Face is still at large
and extremely dangerous.</i>

97
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,760
<i>In other news today...</i>

98
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,960
<i>...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended
his profit-sharing program...</i>

99
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
<i>...to the employees of the successful
electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

100
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
Mr. Wayne.

101
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,560
Your inspections are
a departmental highlight.

102
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
Oh, my God, it's him.

103
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,400
I am a winner. I am a winner.

104
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
I am a winner.

105
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
I am a winner.

106
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,280
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

107
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

108
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,800
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

109
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Mister...?

110
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,680
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

111
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
No, that's my name. And you are?

112
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,760
Nygma.

113
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,880
Edward.

114
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,440
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

115
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,800
Just like I tell everyone.

116
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
We've never actually met, but your name
was on the hiring slip. I have it.

117
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,320
I need that hand back.

118
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, yes, of course.

119
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,520
I'm sorry.

120
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
It's just that...

121
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
...you're my idol.

122
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,040
Back to work.

123
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,960
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

124
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
Back to work.

125
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,440
It's okay.

126
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
What's on your mind?

127
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Precisely.

128
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
What's on all our minds?

129
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,840
Brain waves.

130
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,520
The future...

131
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,680
...of Wayne Enterprises...

132
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
...is brain waves.

133
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,680
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,720
-I terminated his project today.
-It's okay.

135
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,080
I have it!

136
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
My invention...

137
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,320
...beams any TV signal directly
into the human brain.

138
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,320
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves...

139
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,040
...this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

140
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

141
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,800
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

142
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,080
Yes.

143
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
But...

144
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,160
...someone like you would never need it.

145
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,280
Someone so...

146
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,680
...intelligent, witty and...

147
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,160
...charming.

148
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,080
I need a bit of additional funding
for human trials. Let me show you, please!

149
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Now, listen...

150
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,360
...I want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

151
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,840
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

152
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
Look at us! Two of a kind!

153
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,040
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

154
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,160
That's not...

155
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
...going to be good for me.

156
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,520
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,200
...mind manipulation...

161
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,400
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
Sorry.

163
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.

164
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,800
All right, everyone!

165
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
Back to work!

166
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,280
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,880
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I'll make you understand.

169
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
Lock.

170
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
Chair.

171
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
<i>I saw the signal.</i>

172
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
<i>All is ready.</i>

173
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,400
Commissioner?

174
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
He's at home.

175
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,880
I sent the signal.

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
What's wrong?

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Last night at the bank I noticed
something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
His coin.

179
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
It's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,000
It can be exploited.

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
I know.

182
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,280
You called me for this?

183
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,280
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,720
I wish I could say that my interest
in you was...

185
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,560
...purely professional.

186
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Are you trying to get under my cape?

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,800
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

188
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,520
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

189
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

190
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
In grade school: guys with earrings.

191
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,840
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

192
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
Now...

193
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
...black rubber.

194
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,840
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

195
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,480
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

196
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,280
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,880
My life's an open book. You read?

198
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

199
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,240
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

200
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
...you bring your scarred psyche.

201
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
Direct, aren't you?

202
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,560
You like strong women.

203
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,360
I've done my homework.

204
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,320
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

205
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,680
I haven't had much luck with women.

206
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,680
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

207
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I saw the signal.

208
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,680
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

209
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,000
False alarm.

210
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
Are you sure?

211
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
Women.

212
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,560
Now I've got it!

213
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,400
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

214
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
"Too many...."

215
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
I'll show you it works!

216
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,320
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,440
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!

218
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
Caffeine will kill you!

219
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,080
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

220
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
What are you doing?

221
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,880
Untie me!

222
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
This won't hurt.

223
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
At least, I don't think it will.

224
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
What are you doing?

225
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
You touch that switch and--

226
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,160
This?

227
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,720
Losing resolution.

228
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,440
More power!

229
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
Edward Nygma...

230
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
...come on down!

231
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
You're the next contestant on...

232
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,440
<i>...Brain Drain!</i>

233
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one!

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,920
What have we got for him?

235
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

236
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
And a breakdown? Maybe!

237
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,760
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

238
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,840
No, several geniuses.

239
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
A gaggle, a swarm...

240
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
...a flock of freaking Freuds!

241
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,760
Riddle me this, Fred.

242
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
What is everything to someone...

243
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
...and nothing to everyone else?

244
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Your mind, baby!

245
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,520
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

246
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
"I'm sucking up your IQ

247
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,880
"Vacuuming your cortex

248
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,760
"Feeding off your brain"

249
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,160
What a rush!

250
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,880
What the hell just happened?

251
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
A very surprising side effect.

252
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,080
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

253
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,880
...I utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

254
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
Bruce Wayne was right!

255
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,240
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

256
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,840
It is brain manipulation!

257
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,240
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

258
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,920
The human experimentation board!
The AMI!

259
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
And the police!

260
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
You are going up on charges...

261
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
...to court, to jail...

262
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,240
...and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your life!

263
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,200
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't think so.

266
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,880
Help!

267
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
Hang on!

268
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,920
Babe!

269
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,840
You are fired!

270
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
Or should I say...

271
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
...terminated?

272
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,400
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,160
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?

276
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,280
My work raises too many questions?

277
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,120
<i>Why hasn't anybody...</i>

278
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
<i>...put you in your place?</i>

279
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,080
<i>Harvey Dent,
once Gotham's District Attorney...</i>

280
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,640
<i>...was horribly scarred
by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.</i>

281
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,000
<i>Although Batman tried to save him...</i>

282
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,120
<i>...Dent's left-brain damage
turned him into a violent criminal...</i>

283
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,480
<i>...who blamed Batman
and who has vowed to destroy him.</i>

284
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,120
<i>Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,
repeat, extremely dangerous.</i>

285
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
That was the Commissioner.

286
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,120
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

287
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
Horrible way to die.

288
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
The surveillance cameras are down here.

289
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,560
We'll dredge the river, but with
that current, I doubt we'll find the body.

290
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,040
Why?

291
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
Oh, why?

292
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,160
I just can't believe it.

293
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,040
Two years working in the same office.

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,680
He was like my father...

295
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,120
...my brother...

296
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

297
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Get a grip, Edward.

298
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,480
I found this in my cubicle.

299
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,840
You'll find the handwriting matches his,
as does the sentence structure.

300
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,080
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

301
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,920
The memories....

302
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,280
This is last night's security log.

303
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
There's Stickley.

304
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Pretty cut and dry.

305
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,320
Yes, definitely suicide.

306
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,720
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

307
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.

308
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

309
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
I know. Full benefits.

310
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,040
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

311
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll let you know. What's this?

312
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
I don't know.

313
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
I didn't see anyone.

314
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,640
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

315
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,040
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

316
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,760
That's hideous.

317
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,440
What does it mean?

318
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,920
It's a riddle.

319
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,040
"Numbers on my face...13."

320
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,360
One through twelve.

321
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,080
The answer is a clock.

322
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,320
Who would send you a riddle?

323
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
That, Maggie...

324
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,720
...is the riddle.

325
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,840
Guess what I did today?

326
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,360
Wayne Manor.

327
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,360
See you soon.

328
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,520
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

329
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
I...guess I'm early.

330
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,560
I have an appointment.

331
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm Bruce Wayne.

332
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
Good.

333
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,480
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

334
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm sorry.

335
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,560
You...sounded like you were in...

336
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,120
...you know, trouble.

337
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,920
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking in.

338
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
So...

339
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
...how can I help you?

340
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,880
Someone's been sending me love letters.

341
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,720
One at my office and one at my home.

342
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your opinion.

343
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,160
A clock.

344
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,280
Clock.

345
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,880
"Tear one off and scratch my head.

346
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,920
"What once was red is black instead."

347
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
A match.

348
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,800
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

349
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,360
"Wacko?"

350
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,600
Is that a technical term?

351
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,600
Patient may suffer from obsession...

352
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,640
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?

353
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,640
So, what you're saying is...

354
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,560
...this guy's a total wacko.

355
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
Exactly.

356
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,200
He's obsessed with you.

357
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,160
His only escape may be
to purge the fixation.

358
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,880
To kill me.

359
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,600
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

360
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
You like bats?

361
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,160
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

362
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,640
An inkblot.

363
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,440
People see what they want.

364
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,920
The question is: do you like bats?

365
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Still playing with dolls?

366
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,800
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

367
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,160
Some cultures believe she protects you
from bad dreams.

368
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

369
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,080
You look so sad.

370
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,840
Do you need one?

371
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
Me? No. Why would I?

372
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,560
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you?

373
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,040
What is it you really came here for?

374
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,880
Yikes, time's up.

375
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
That's usually my line.

376
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
I'd love to stay here chatting--

377
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,160
Would you?

378
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,280
I'm not so sure.

379
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,400
I must get you out of those clothes.

380
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
Excuse me?

381
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,640
And into a black dress.

382
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,400
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

383
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

384
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,440
<i>...boys and girls of all ages...</i>

385
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,160
<i>...welcome to the greatest show on earth!</i>

386
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,040
Who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

387
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,560
Dr. Chase Meridian.

388
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,680
A doctor?

389
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,440
What kind of doctor?

390
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,680
<i>...for Gotham Children's Hospital.</i>

391
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,360
<i>Let's thank our largest single donor:</i>

392
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,640
<i>Bruce Wayne!</i>

393
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,680
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

394
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,360
<i>...70 feet above the ground...</i>

395
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,800
<i>...performing feats
of unimaginable aerial skill...</i>

396
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,320
<i>...the Flying Graysons!</i>

397
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,480
Listen...

398
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,200
...I'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

399
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,600
I'd like to.

400
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,520
I love climbing. I really love it.

401
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,760
But?

402
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,880
I've met someone.

403
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,440
That's fast work. You just moved here.

404
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,240
You could say he just...

405
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,680
...dropped out of the sky and...

406
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,160
...bang!

407
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,320
I think he felt it too.

408
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
He sure did.

409
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,680
What?

410
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,640
Who wouldn't?

411
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,960
<i>Now...</i>

412
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,640
<i>...Richard...</i>

413
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>...the youngest Flying Grayson...</i>

414
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,040
<i>...will perform the awe-inspiring...</i>

415
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,440
<i>...death drop...</i>

416
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,720
<i>...without the safety...</i>

417
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
<i>...of a net!</i>

418
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,520
Let's go.

419
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
You'll be okay.

420
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,920
<i>Ladies...</i>

421
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,680
<i>...and gentlemen!</i>

422
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,320
<i>Now, the new management
of the circus invites you to forget...</i>

423
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
<i>...this good, wholesome fun...</i>

424
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,520
<i>...and join us in a celebration
of absolute chaos...</i>

425
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
<i>...and true jesters!</i>

426
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
<i>Bring it on!</i>

427
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,080
<i>Now!</i>

428
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,440
<i>Tonight, a new act for your...</i>

429
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,360
<i>...personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top. "</i>

430
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,480
<i>Let us direct your attention to the ring.</i>

431
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,480
<i>Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...</i>

432
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,640
<i>...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.</i>

433
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,840
<i>And in our innocent hand...</i>

434
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
<i>...a radio detonator.</i>

435
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,200
What do you want?

436
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,920
<i>Want, Mr. Mayor?</i>

437
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,920
<i>One simple thing: Batman.</i>

438
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
<i>Bruised, broken, bleeding...</i>

439
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,760
<i>...in a word: dead!</i>

440
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,280
Batman.

441
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,400
<i>Who do we have before us?</i>

442
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,080
<i>Gotham's finest...</i>

443
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,520
<i>...well-to-do...</i>

444
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,680
<i>...influential.</i>

445
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,040
<i>Surely one of you knows who Batman is.</i>

446
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,560
<i>Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits
is Batman!</i>

447
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,360
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

448
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,880
Harvey!

449
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm Batman!

450
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,520
We can stop them.

451
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,840
Go out on the rigging.

452
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,640
Be careful.

453
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,880
Don't worry.

454
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,720
Go to work, boys!

455
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,400
Our kind of day.

456
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,880
Reach for it! Stop it!

457
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,800
Oh, my God.

458
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,360
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

459
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,000
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.

460
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,040
Welcome, Master Grayson.

461
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,240
I'm Alfred.

462
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,200
How're you doing, Al?

463
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,800
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

464
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Okay, I'm out of here.

465
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,760
Excuse me?

466
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,000
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

467
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,240
...saved me a lot
of social-service interviews.

468
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

469
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,680
Take it easy.

470
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,480
Where will you go? The circus
must be halfway to Metropolis.

471
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,200
Get a fix on Two-Face.

472
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Then I'll kill him.

473
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,840
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

474
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,520
It'll make it worse.

475
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,560
Spare me the sermons, all right?

476
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,760
I don't need your advice or your charity.

477
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
Nice bike.

478
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,120
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

479
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,480
You're almost on empty.

480
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,880
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.

481
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,920
The pump's over here.

482
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,520
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

483
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,840
That's a 1917 Harley.

484
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,760
Yep.

485
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,520
Indian Classic, fully restored.

486
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,240
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

487
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,360
They only made a hundred.

488
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,120
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

489
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,920
You've got two.

490
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,600
That one doesn't run.

491
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
The throttle sticks on this one.

492
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,800
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

493
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,120
...these need a lot of work.

494
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,360
If someone were to fix them up...

495
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,080
...they could keep one.

496
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,040
Anyway...

497
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,680
...have a nice trip.

498
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,000
You'll land on your feet.

499
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,440
Is the young master leaving?

500
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,800
Pity.

501
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,640
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

502
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,720
Hey, Al, wait up.

503
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,120
Master Bruce?

504
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Just like my parents.

505
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
It's happening again.

506
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,720
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

507
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
I killed them.

508
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,920
What did you say?

509
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,360
He killed them.

510
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,600
Two-Face.

511
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,040
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

512
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,400
No, no.

513
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,880
You said, "I killed them."

514
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,400
Take care of the kid.

515
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,000
Certainly, sir.

516
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,560
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

517
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,920
No.

518
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

519
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,040
Is this a robin?

520
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,640
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

521
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
My father said I was his hero.

522
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,360
I flew in like a robin.

523
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,880
Some hero I turned out to be.

524
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,800
But your father was right.

525
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,160
You are a hero. I can tell.

526
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,240
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.

527
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,160
I think I'll just put it in here.

528
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,400
Broken wings mend in time.

529
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,120
One day Robin will fly again.

530
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,760
I promise.

531
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,240
We'll drive.

532
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,160
The Puzzler?

533
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,880
The Gamester?

534
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,120
Captain Kill?

535
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,760
Question Mark Man?

536
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,480
Thank you. Thank you so much.

537
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,520
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

538
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,960
...is driving us insane!

539
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,800
Don't worry, baby.

540
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,120
You'll kill him soon.

541
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,040
Besides...

542
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,240
...I made your favorite:

543
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,280
Sparkling champagne and...

544
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,160
...yummy poached salmon
with little quail eggs and...

545
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,440
...a creamy...

546
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,720
...dreamy...

547
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,680
...lemon soufflé.

548
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
No, I made your favorite:

549
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,720
A charred heart of black boar...

550
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,400
...a side of raw donkey meat...

551
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,080
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

552
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,640
Perfect!

553
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,560
Ladies, you spoil us!

554
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,560
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

555
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,480
What?

556
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,120
I hope you made extra.

557
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,040
Who the hell are you?

558
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,520
Just a friend.

559
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,400
But you can call me...

560
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,560
...The Riddler.

561
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,560
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!

562
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,040
But then if I talked, what would keep you
from slaying me, O Segregated One?

563
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,560
That's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

564
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,200
Let's see if you bleed green.

565
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,600
It's not me you want to kill.

566
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,160
That's just too easy for someone
as powerful as you and...

567
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
...you.

568
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,680
But Batman...

569
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,120
...there's a challenge.

570
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,840
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

571
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,120
But have you thought it through? A few
bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

572
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,360
Wet hands.

573
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,360
Post-homicidal depression.

574
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,280
Why not humiliate him first?

575
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,160
Yeah.

576
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,640
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is
at his weakest...

577
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,360
...crush him!

578
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,080
I see that...

579
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,560
...sparkle in your left eye.

580
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,760
I can help you get Batman.

581
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,320
That is, if you'II...

582
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,160
...spare my life for just a few moments.

583
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,480
Thank you.

584
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,480
<i>I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.</i>

585
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,480
Beautiful.

586
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,760
It's so dark and Gothic and...

587
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
...disgustingly decadent.

588
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
Yet so bright and chipper and...

589
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,520
...conservative.

590
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,760
It's so you!

591
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,320
And yet, so you!

592
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,200
Very few people are both a summer
and a winter, but...

593
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,280
...but you pull it off nicely.

594
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,160
What's the point?

595
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,360
Has anyone ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

596
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,720
This is the point.

597
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,880
This is how I found you.

598
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,960
Let me demonstrate.

599
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,920
This is your brain on The Box.

600
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,960
This is my brain on The Box.

601
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,360
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

602
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,640
I'll have more.

603
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,320
There's more. But only the first one's free.

604
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,920
Here's the bargain:

605
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,680
You'll help me steal production capital...

606
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,520
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

607
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,200
...and become Gotham's cleverest,
carbon-based life form!

608
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,120
And in return....

609
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,240
Is everybody paying attention?

610
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,200
I will help you solve the greatest riddle
of all.

611
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,320
The mother of all riddles:

612
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,080
Who is...

613
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,880
...Batman?

614
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,880
You broke into our hideout.

615
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,560
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

616
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,320
We should crush your bones into powder.

617
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,640
But you pose an interesting proposition.

618
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,840
Therefore, heads: we accept,
and tails: we blow your damn head off.

619
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,120
Here's a good one.

620
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,560
No, no, no!

621
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,160
There is a good one.

622
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,480
-Leave that. I'll attend to it.
-I'm not used to being waited on.

623
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,080
Don't shoot me!

624
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,560
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

625
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,200
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

626
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,520
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...

627
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,240
...and assert yourself.

628
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,960
That looks fun. Let me try.

629
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,840
Ball up the fist, reach way back...
assert yourself.

630
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,600
One hundred thousand,
two hundred and twenty.

631
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,440
One hundred and....

632
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,040
I lost count!

633
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,080
<i>Last night another robbery,
perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...</i>

634
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,720
<i>...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,
with no sign of Batman.</i>

635
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,520
<i>Teamed with Two-Face,
this new criminal's pattern...</i>

636
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,760
<i>...of marking his crimes with puzzles
has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.</i>

637
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,400
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

638
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,960
That was with the morning mail.

639
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,840
"The eight of us go forth, not back.

640
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,440
"To protect our king from the foe's attack."

641
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,680
Chess pawns.

642
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,800
Clock.

643
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,680
Matches.

644
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,520
All physical, man-made objects.

645
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,640
Small in size, light in weight.

646
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,240
What's the connection?

647
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,880
With all due respect,
that's why they call him The Riddler.

648
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,960
May I help you?

649
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,520
Why is this the only locked door?

650
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,680
What's back there?

651
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,880
Master Wayne's dead wives.

652
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,120
The silver closet. On your way.

653
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,040
<i>Now, you can be part of the action!</i>

654
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,840
<i>Nygma Tech brings the joy
of 3-D entertainment into your home!</i>

655
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...</i>

656
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,920
<i>...my vision.</i>

657
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>The Box in every home in America...</i>

658
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,880
<i>...and one day, the world!</i>

659
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,200
<i>In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...</i>

660
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,640
<i>...has become the rage of Gotham.</i>

661
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,760
<i>Rioting occurred last night

662
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,720
<i>There is hardly a home
without the Nygma Tech Box.</i>

663
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,400
<i>Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites
into zombies.</i>

664
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,240
<i>But Edward Nygma just shrugs.</i>

665
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,200
<i>"That's what they said
when TV was invented. "</i>

666
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,800
Master Dick!

667
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,360
Up here.

668
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Just checking, young sir.

669
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,560
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

670
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,440
I have something for you. It's on the table.

671
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,480
I hope you like it.

672
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,920
Call it clinical intuition.

673
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,120
I thought your dreams needed changing.

674
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,440
My parents were murdered before me...

675
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,240
...when I was a kid.

676
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,400
I don't...

677
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,720
...remember a lot of what happened, but...

678
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,240
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.

679
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,680
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

680
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,960
It's a red leather book.

681
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,080
Something else....

682
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,000
My dreams come to me
when I'm awake now.

683
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,160
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

684
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,240
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

685
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,920
I'll be right back.

686
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,280
Is it possible there's an aspect
of your parents' death you haven't faced?

687
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,680
You were so young when it happened.

688
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,160
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

689
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,920
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it?

690
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,120
All right.

691
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,920
I think he's fascinating.

692
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,760
Clinically.

693
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,880
Why does a man do this?

694
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,440
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.

695
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,560
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

696
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,320
It's more than just...

697
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,880
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

698
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,440
Bruce, are you jealous?

699
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,200
No.

700
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,360
I can't be jealous of Batman.

701
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,560
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

702
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
What are you protecting me from?

703
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,280
Do you want to know me?

704
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,960
Do you want to know who I am?

705
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,000
I guess...

706
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,640
...we're all two people.

707
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,920
The one in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

708
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,360
Rage...

709
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,920
...violence...

710
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,200
...passion.

711
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,440
Excuse me.

712
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,160
I'm busy.

713
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,320
<i>I'm sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.</i>

714
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,800
Is he okay?

715
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,680
<i>I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.</i>

716
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,880
He ran away?

717
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,200
<i>Actually, he took the car.</i>

718
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,840
He boosted the Jag?

719
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,400
<i>Not the Jaguar.</i>

720
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,880
<i>The other car.</i>

721
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,040
The Bentley?

722
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,240
<i>No, sir.</i>

723
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,880
<i>The other car.</i>

724
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,000
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies?

725
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,720
It's Batman!

726
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,440
Open up, Batman.

727
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,000
Wait!

728
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,560
That's not Batman!

729
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,960
What do you mean?

730
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,520
That's Batboy!

731
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,760
It ain't the Bat!

732
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,440
Let her go!

733
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,480
Who the hell are you?

734
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,120
I'm Batman.

735
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,440
I forgot my suit, all right?

736
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,440
Come on, run!

737
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,920
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

738
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,960
Go!

739
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,720
Thanks, you saved my life!

740
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,840
I could definitely get
into this superhero gig.

741
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,200
Batman!

742
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,640
Bastard!

743
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,640
It should've been you!

744
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,280
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus...

745
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,400
...they'd still be alive!

746
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,280
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

747
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,000
All I can think about every day
is getting Two-Face.

748
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,960
He took my whole life.

749
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,000
When I was out there tonight...

750
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,240
...I imagined it was him I was fighting...

751
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,400
...even when I was fighting you...

752
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,200
...and the pain went away.

753
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,040
Do you understand?

754
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,440
Yes, I do.

755
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,800
Good.

756
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,120
You must help me find him.

757
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,160
When we do...

758
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,280
...I'm the one who kills him.

759
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,000
So, you're willing to take a life?

760
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,600
As long as it's Two-Face.

761
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,640
Then it will happen this way:

762
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,280
You make the kill.

763
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,680
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

764
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,520
So you run into the night
to find another face, and another...

765
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,400
...and another...

766
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,440
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

767
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,200
...that revenge has become
your whole life...

768
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,320
...and you won't know why.

769
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,280
You can't understand.

770
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,040
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

771
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,760
Yes, they were.

772
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,360
We're the same.

773
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,560
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.

774
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,240
No.

775
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,920
I can't.

776
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,600
You still have a choice.

777
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,480
Look, Bruce...

778
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,480
...I'm a part of this, whether you like it
or not.

779
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,480
<i>Tonight all of Gotham society
has turned out for Edward Nygma's...</i>

780
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,680
<i>...gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.</i>

781
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,960
Thanks, Al.

782
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,160
My pleasure, sir.

783
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,760
<i>They'll be dining

784
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,720
<i>...on the glamorous roof
of the Ritz Gotham.</i>

785
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,920
What's it like to have your face
on the cover of every magazine?

786
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,320
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?

787
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,640
Gotham must know!

788
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,320
There's Bruce Wayne!

789
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,240
Brucie!

790
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,720
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

791
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,440
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

792
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,760
Shut up. You're here to work!

793
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,560
How's my mole?

794
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,760
Fine.

795
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,080
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

796
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,360
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.

797
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,760
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

798
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,680
Bruce, old man.

799
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,880
The press wonders what it's like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...

800
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,680
...generally outdone in every way.

801
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,480
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

802
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,880
Great party. Nice suit.

803
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,840
Wit. Good.

804
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,400
And you are?

805
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,360
Chase.

806
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,640
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

807
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,160
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

808
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,040
You can call me anything you want.

809
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,480
Ladies and gentlemen...

810
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,280
...the future!

811
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,840
My New Improved Box offers
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

812
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,840
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

813
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,440
How do you create these images, hon?

814
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,440
That, my dear, is my little secret.

815
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,560
Fully-interactive holographs.

816
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,000
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed into the brain...

817
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,760
...could create such images.

818
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,800
And you wish you thought of it.

819
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,080
Don't be a sore loser.

820
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,320
Step inside. Give it a try.

821
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,160
If you can introduce images into the mind,
what stops you from...

822
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,640
...extracting images out of the mind?

823
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,960
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

824
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,600
Shall we dance?

825
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,560
Naughty, naughty.

826
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,920
Looking for something?

827
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,840
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

828
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,360
Clever.

829
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,280
Thanks.

830
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,720
My pleasure.

831
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,480
<i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

832
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,000
<i>Relax.</i>

833
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,800
<i>Tell me your...</i>

834
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,880
<i>...dreams.</i>

835
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,760
<i>Tell me...</i>

836
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,600
<i>...your fantasies.</i>

837
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,000
<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

838
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,800
<i>Tell me...</i>

839
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,600
<i>...your deepest...</i>

840
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,120
<i>...darkest...</i>

841
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,720
<i>...fears.</i>

842
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,440
Relax, folks!

843
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,640
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!

844
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,880
We're interested in the basics:

845
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,480
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

846
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,920
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt!

847
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,400
Emergency, Alfred.

848
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,360
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,920
Be calm, everybody!

850
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,440
Just stay calm!

851
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,920
Excuse me!

852
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,040
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

853
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,400
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver Batman.

854
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

855
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,640
Patience, hell! We want him dead!

856
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,280
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

857
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,800
You could have let me in on the caper.

858
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,960
We could have organized it, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights!

859
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,320
Your entrance was good, his was better.

860
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,520
The difference?

861
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,000
Showmanship!

862
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,600
Emergency, Alfred.

863
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,080
Oh, sir....

864
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,440
I could be fired for this.

865
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,240
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

866
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,800
All right, boys! Phase Two!

867
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,600
My place, midnight.

868
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,960
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

869
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,120
Why can't you just die?

870
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,040
Hi.

871
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,240
What were you doing?

872
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,080
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that?

873
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,640
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?

874
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,240
What's a good sidekick name?

875
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
"Dick Grayson, college student."

876
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,600
Screw you!

877
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,720
I saved your life. You owe me.

878
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,040
You're going to get yourself killed.

879
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,440
I'm your new partner.

880
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
No!

881
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,480
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be
watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.

882
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,440
How will you stop me?

883
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,560
I can stop you.

884
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,920
Hang this next to the Batsuit...

885
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,480
...where it belongs.

886
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,720
You're encouraging him.

887
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,360
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

888
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,280
They need guidance.

889
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,840
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

890
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,800
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

891
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,280
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

892
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,480
She seems lovely and wise.

893
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,280
I've never been in love before.

894
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,440
Go to her.

895
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,520
Tell her how you feel.

896
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,160
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

897
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,200
Let her decide.

898
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,320
I'm sorry.

899
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,120
I can't believe this.

900
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,960
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

901
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,680
Your eyes...

902
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,000
...your lips...

903
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,760
...your body.

904
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,640
Now I have you and...

905
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,880
...I'm wishing you were somebody else.

906
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,720
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

907
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,360
I've met someone.

908
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,200
He's not you.

909
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,520
I hope you can understand.

910
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,080
I understand.

911
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,120
Well....

912
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,280
That's just what I said.

913
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,520
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

914
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,200
How to map the human mind.

915
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,920
Would you like to see
what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

916
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,720
Riddle me this:

917
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,240
What kind of man...

918
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,400
...has bats on the brain?

919
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,600
-Go ahead. You can say it.
-You're a genius.

920
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,000
Oh, stop.

921
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,400
So, from this day on...

922
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,680
...Batman is no more.

923
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,440
You can't just quit.

924
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,800
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

925
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,320
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.

926
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,680
Faces I've never seen.

927
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,160
Well...

928
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,080
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

929
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,720
You can't tell me what to do
with the rest of my life.

930
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,760
My dad told me that every man goes
his own way.

931
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,840
My way goes to Two-Face.

932
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,840
You must help me.

933
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,320
And if you do find Harvey...

934
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,000
...and then you kill him...

935
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,280
...what next?

936
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,000
Exactly.

937
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,920
Then you'd be alone, like me.

938
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,520
No, you must let this go.

939
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,680
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

940
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,240
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

941
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,320
Two-Face has got to pay.

942
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,800
Please.

943
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,280
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

944
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,400
...everything.

945
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,400
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

946
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,760
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

947
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,960
Happy Halloween.

948
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,800
Happy Halloween to you.

949
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,080
I asked you here tonight because
there's something I wanted to tell you.

950
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,120
I wanted to tell you something too.

951
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,800
What I wanted--

952
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,520
Go ahead, you first.

953
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,720
Trick or treat!

954
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,640
All my life I have been...

955
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,720
...attracted to a certain kind of man.

956
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,080
The wrong kind.

957
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,840
Look at what I do for a living.

958
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,280
And since...

959
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,440
...since I met you, I....

960
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,080
Oh, God.

961
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,280
Why am I so nervous?

962
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,480
Don't eat too much tonight
or you'll be sick in your beds.

963
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,240
Happy Halloween!

964
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,040
What's wrong?

965
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,480
It's happening again.

966
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,800
Flashes.

967
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,040
My parents' death.

968
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,560
Your memories are trying
to break through.

969
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,520
I want to tell you something.

970
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,480
Something I've never told anyone.

971
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,800
It's all right.

972
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,720
It's all right. I'm here.

973
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,000
<i>I'm here.</i>

974
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,400
<i>The night of my parents' wake...</i>

975
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,480
<i>...the priest's words gave no comfort.</i>

976
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,520
<i>Of course.</i>

977
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,800
<i>There, on my father's desk...</i>

978
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,560
<i>...the red book.</i>

979
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,200
<i>His journal.</i>

980
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,560
<i>He'd written in it every day.</i>

981
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,640
<i>But now he'd never write in it again.</i>

982
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,240
<i>At that moment I knew...</i>

983
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,400
<i>...my life would never be the same.</i>

984
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,160
<i>I raced out into the storm...</i>

985
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,680
<i>...trying to outrun the rage.</i>

986
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,960
<i>The pain.</i>

987
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,280
<i>Then I fell.</i>

988
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,640
<i>I fell forever.</i>

989
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,520
<i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

990
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,040
<i>It must have been there for centuries.</i>

991
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,240
<i>And there...</i>

992
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,680
<i>...deep in the shadows...</i>

993
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,320
<i>...I saw....</i>

994
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,600
<i>It was coming toward me.</i>

995
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,080
<i>I was scared at first, but only at first.</i>

996
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,200
<i>The figure in the dark was my destiny.</i>

997
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,480
<i>It would change my life forever.</i>

998
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,000
<i>I would use its image to strike terror
into the hearts of those who did evil.</i>

999
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,360
<i>I would ensure what happened to me
would never happen to anyone else.</i>

1000
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,200
<i>I would have my revenge.</i>

1001
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,040
What are you trying to tell me?

1002
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,400
I'm....

1003
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,360
Twick or tweet!

1004
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,400
Trick.

1005
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,680
Remember the plan?

1006
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,520
Seize and capture.

1007
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,280
No killing.

1008
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,360
That goes double for you.

1009
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,880
If I was a superhero...

1010
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,560
...where would I hide?

1011
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,600
Spank me.

1012
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,400
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

1013
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,400
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

1014
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,840
Shut up!

1015
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,040
Now, that's impressive!

1016
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,920
It's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

1017
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,160
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

1018
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,760
Somebody tell the fat lady...

1019
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,640
...she's on in five.

1020
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,440
"Joygasm! "

1021
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,840
Get the girl!

1022
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,280
Don't kill him.

1023
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,720
If you kill him...

1024
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,920
...he won't learn nothing.

1025
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,320
Master Bruce!

1026
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,600
How are you, young man?

1027
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,760
You haven't called me that for a long time.

1028
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,800
Old habits die hard.

1029
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,040
Are you all right?

1030
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,000
Where's Chase?

1031
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,240
I'm afraid they've taken her.

1032
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,520
Master Dick has run away.

1033
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,000
The cave has been destroyed.

1034
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,920
And there's another riddle.

1035
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,920
I'm coming, my sweet.

1036
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,880
Like the jacket?

1037
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,120
It keeps me safe when I'm...

1038
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,000
...jogging at night.

1039
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,520
Batman will come for me.

1040
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,960
Batman?

1041
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,680
Batman, you say?

1042
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,360
Coming for you?

1043
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,800
I'm...

1044
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,800
...counting on it.

1045
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,200
What is that? Where's it coming from?

1046
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,240
There!

1047
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,200
Who's doing that?

1048
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,920
The Riddler!

1049
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,960
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.

1050
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,040
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

1051
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,560
In....

1052
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,120
A-E-l-O-U.

1053
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,240
Vowels.

1054
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,000
Not entirely unclever, sir.

1055
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,720
But what do a clock, a match,
chess pawns...

1056
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,080
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?

1057
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,280
Every riddle contains a number
and they arrived in this order:

1058
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,720
13, 1, 8...

1059
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,800
...and 5.

1060
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,400
13, 1, 8 and 5.

1061
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,640
Meaning?

1062
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,440
Letters of the alphabet?

1063
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,440
Of course, 13 is M.

1064
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,600
1 would be A, 8 would be H
and 5 would be E.

1065
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,480
M-A-H-E.

1066
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,880
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

1067
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,400
18 is R.

1068
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,640
M-R-E.

1069
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,200
How about...

1070
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,640
..."Mr. E"?

1071
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,960
-Mystery?
-Another name for mystery?

1072
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,000
Enigma.

1073
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,920
Mr. E. Nygma.

1074
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,920
Edward Nygma.

1075
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,160
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1076
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,640
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1077
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,280
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

1078
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:41,080
All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications. But it's not tested.

1079
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,560
Tonight's a good night.

1080
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,320
What do you suggest? By sea...

1081
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,280
...or by air?

1082
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,240
Why not both?

1083
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,240
Who's your tailor?

1084
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,280
I took the liberty, sir.

1085
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,040
"R?"

1086
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,920
What's that stand for?

1087
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,720
Robin.

1088
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,880
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

1089
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,480
You could use a hand.

1090
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,720
Two against two are better odds.

1091
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,520
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

1092
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,320
"A man's got to go his own way."

1093
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,240
A friend taught me that.

1094
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,560
Not just a friend.

1095
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,280
A partner.

1096
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,760
He's not coming.

1097
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,760
Shut it down.

1098
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,840
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1099
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,920
Hey, go!

1100
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,280
A-14.

1101
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,480
Hit!

1102
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,480
Sweet!

1103
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,200
B-12.

1104
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,040
Hit!

1105
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,000
My favorite vitamin.

1106
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,360
That sinking feeling.

1107
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:42,840
I like this game.

1108
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,000
C-9.

1109
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,400
You sunk my battleship!

1110
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,440
Who, me?

1111
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,640
This is your captain speaking.

1112
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,640
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

1113
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,440
I got him!

1114
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,600
I hope they can find the little black box.

1115
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,040
Now...

1116
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,920
...the real game begins.

1117
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,080
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

1118
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,720
The ground, it's all metal.

1119
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,800
It's full of holes: holey.

1120
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,040
Wait!

1121
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,120
The whole island's moving!

1122
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,880
Looking for us?

1123
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,160
That was for my mother!

1124
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,640
My father!

1125
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,560
My brother!

1126
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,240
And this is for me!

1127
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,640
Finally, justice is served!

1128
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:34,440
Let us die!

1129
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,400
You're a man after our own heart, son!

1130
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,440
I'll see you in hell!

1131
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,120
I'd rather see you in jail!

1132
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,240
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

1133
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,480
The Bat's taught you well.

1134
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,600
Noble.

1135
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,040
Stupid...

1136
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,960
...but noble.

1137
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,200
Riddle me this.

1138
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,240
Riddle me that.

1139
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,960
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

1140
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,680
No more tricks, Edward.

1141
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,600
Very well, then.

1142
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,640
Let's get real.

1143
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,400
Release Chase. This is between you
and me.

1144
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,520
And me...

1145
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,960
...and me!

1146
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,560
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and
now you've devised a way to read minds.

1147
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,960
You betcha!

1148
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,160
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TV's around the world...

1149
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,360
...feeding me credit-card numbers...

1150
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:33,080
...bank codes...

1151
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,000
...sexual fantasies...

1152
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
...and little white lies.

1153
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,800
Into my head they'll go.

1154
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,960
Victory is inevitable.

1155
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,800
For if knowledge is power...

1156
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,440
...then a god...

1157
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,560
...am...

1158
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,680
...I!

1159
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,720
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

1160
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,680
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!

1161
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,320
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

1162
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,400
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

1163
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,320
We'll find out today!

1164
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,160
But first, let's meet our contestants.

1165
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,800
Behind curtain...

1166
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,280
...number one...

1167
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,360
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!

1168
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,200
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

1169
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,720
...and foolishly hopes to be the love
of Bruce's life.

1170
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,280
Behind curtain number two...

1171
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,600
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.

1172
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,920
This acrobat turned orphan...

1173
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,560
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

1174
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,720
...bare-naked with a girl.

1175
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:02,360
And below these contestants...

1176
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,480
...my personal favorite:

1177
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,240
A watery grave.

1178
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,400
Just one little touch...

1179
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,840
...and five seconds later
these two players are...

1180
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,080
...gull feed on the rocks below.

1181
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,960
Not enough time to save them both.

1182
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,960
Which one will it be, Batman?

1183
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,400
Bruce's love?

1184
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:31,240
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1185
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:37,040
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

1186
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:39,880
It's all one giant death-trap.

1187
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,400
Judges?

1188
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:45,280
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

1189
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,040
But thank you for playing.

1190
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,000
Wait!

1191
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,760
I have a riddle for you.

1192
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,960
For me?

1193
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,920
Really?

1194
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,240
Tell me.

1195
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,320
I see without seeing.

1196
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,840
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1197
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:10,600
What am I?

1198
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,160
Please!

1199
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
You're as blind as a bat!

1200
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,600
Exactly.

1201
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,440
Bummer!

1202
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,400
Thanks.

1203
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,760
All those heroics for nothing.

1204
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,520
No more riddles, no more curtains one
and two.

1205
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,440
Just plain curtains!

1206
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,400
Aren't you forgetting something?

1207
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,680
Your coin.

1208
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,280
You're always of two minds.

1209
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,520
Yes, of course. You're right.

1210
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,600
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

1211
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,760
You've always been a good friend.

1212
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,640
Why?

1213
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,080
Why can't I...

1214
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,600
...kill you?

1215
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,680
Too many questions.

1216
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,720
Too many questions.

1217
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,760
Poor Edward.

1218
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,360
I had to save them both.

1219
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,480
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne
and Batman.

1220
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,040
Not because I have to be.

1221
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,320
Now...

1222
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,760
...because I choose to be.

1223
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:12,360
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1224
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,920
Edward Nygma...

1225
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,760
...has been screaming for hours
that he knows the true identity...

1226
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,360
...of Batman.

1227
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,680
Edward?

1228
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,600
Who...

1229
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:37,400
...is it?

1230
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,120
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

1231
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,160
Do you remember me?

1232
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,680
How could I forget?

1233
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,240
Dr. Burton tells me...

1234
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:55,200
...you know who Batman is.

1235
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,040
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

1236
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,920
Edward, please.

1237
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,600
Who is Batman?

1238
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,400
I'm...

1239
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,080
...Batman.

1240
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,080
Your secret is safe.

1241
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,240
He is definitely a wacko.

1242
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,520
"Wacko?"

1243
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,400
Is that a technical term?

1244
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,080
Listen...

1245
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,600
...I won't need this anymore.

1246
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,480
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

1247
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,280
Don't work too late.
