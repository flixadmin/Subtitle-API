1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,036
I wrote it all down:
4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,714
Courtyard in back, south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,315
- Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
- No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,834
- Is that the listing sheet?
- There isn't one.

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,309
I heard about it this morning. It'll be gone today.

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,437
- How many more?
- None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,835
- Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
- Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,073
Evan!

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,237
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,632
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,994
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
I'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,316
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,231
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,709
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,552
- Thank you.
- Hello.

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,472
It's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,118
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,591
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlour floor.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,679
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,388
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,314
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,788
Sarah.

24
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,679
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,437
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,750
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,398
I don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,314
It's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,030
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,714
It allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,792
Working elevator.

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,038
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,519
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,989
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,232
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,320
It's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,790
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,630
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,153
Can I see it first?

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,516
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,160
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,949
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,600
It's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,712
You'll have another family. You could have two.

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,995
It's a fortune.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,675
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,353
He can afford it.

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,155
It would be so lovely
if I could show the property before I leave.

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,355
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,751
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,717
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,439
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
I don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,199
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,918
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,275
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,268
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,996
May I ask what you do, Mrs...

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,792
Altman.

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,428
Actually, I'm going back to school. Columbia.

62
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,318
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,035
I didn't realize you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,790
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,152
Master bath.

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,548
Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died.

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,108
His kids are suing each other over the estate.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,031
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,190
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,033
I hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,317
Stop calling it "the property."
It sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,599
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,675
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,149
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,996
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,268
That's strange.

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,469
What?

78
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,710
Is this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,870
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,397
On caravan,
no one from our office had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,638
It's called a panic room.

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,438
- What?
- A safe room.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,598
- A castle keep in medieval times.
- I've read about these.

84
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,910
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,355
One can't be too careful about home invasion.

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,759
This is perfect.

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,035
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,078
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,516
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? I think not.

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,479
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,314
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,552
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,678
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,988
Why?

95
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,877
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,110
No, but I loved her last album.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,429
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,635
Steel.

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,228
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,749
Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,512
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,150
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,275
Open it, please.

104
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,989
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,149
Please open the door.

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,719
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,677
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,274
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,032
This is really dangerous.

110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,357
- That door is a hazard.
- Not at all.

111
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,476
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,439
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,192
It couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,954
I know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,638
It's working. I hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,635
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,398
579 what?

118
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,559
3000.

119
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,711
Patsy's Pizza. Please hold.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,873
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,237
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,793
What do you mean?

123
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,954
Our first night.
I should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,314
I like pizza.

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,028
Fuck him.

126
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,429
Don't.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,592
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,473
I agree.

129
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,119
But don't.

130
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,199
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,998
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,435
You never asked what I thought of this house.

133
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,590
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,877
- I liked our old house.
- Well, so did I.

135
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,239
You know what I was thinking?

136
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,835
I was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,673
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,589
Go ahead.

139
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,796
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,953
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,311
Dad already did it.
I'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,875
Oh, yeah?

143
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,435
So I'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,433
Is that what he said?

145
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,155
Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan?

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,515
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,513
I'll ride with you.

148
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,713
Why'd you bring me here
if I can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,313
That's it. I quit.

150
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,109
I'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,069
Come here.

152
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,556
It's disgusting how much I love you.

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,153
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,277
- Mom?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,713
It's too dark.

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,388
Better?

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,239
That's better.

158
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,113
"Bypass non-ready zone."

159
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,548
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,279
"Shunt. Enter."

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,833
"Bypass non-ready zone."

162
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,439
"Shunt."

163
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,478
"Enter zone number."

164
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,832
"Shunt again."

165
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,636
In the morning I got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,158
Go, go back.

167
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,914
Do it.

168
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,795
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,468
Amateur.

170
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,157
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,198
It's about time. I'm freezing my tits off out there.

172
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,229
- Who is that?
- This is Raoul.

173
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,879
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,554
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,910
- Where'd you get him?
- Through some people.

176
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,592
Open the fucking door.

177
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,959
No shit.

178
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,669
What is this?

179
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,116
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,599
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,911
- This is your department, Junior!
- They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,831
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,710
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,279
- 14-day escrow.
- You fucked me!

185
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,558
14-day escrow! That's almost three weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,679
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,479
Business days. Escrow is always business days.

188
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,232
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,708
Right?

190
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,034
I'm out of here.

191
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,996
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,112
We can handle this. Can we still handle this?

193
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,319
It's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,550
- Unless Daddy comes home.
- He's not.

195
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,519
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,358
It's just her and the kid!

197
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,198
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,513
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,240
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,474
- Wait! Twenty minutes!
- She'll call the police.

201
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,391
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.

202
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,392
So we keep an eye on her.

203
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,997
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,239
I don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,231
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,389
Who are you?

208
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,998
I'm Raoul.

209
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,910
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,718
This is still a good plan.

211
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,759
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
It's just got a slight twist.

212
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,114
Yeah.

213
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,396
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,031
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,035
No family.

216
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,675
You're right. It's all fucked up. I fucked it up!

217
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,950
It's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,951
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,033
...and no one but you and I even knows it's here.

220
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,074
Hey, I want that money. I want it!

221
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,713
But you...

222
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,031
...you need that money.

223
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,877
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,749
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,477
Kill the phones.

226
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,551
Top floor, little girl. I've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,832
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,878
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,229
Get up!

230
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,752
What did you do that for?

231
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,711
Where are you going?

232
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,759
- What's going on?
- People. In the house.

233
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,519
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,034
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,509
I told you. I don't hurt people.

236
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,872
They're going downstairs.

237
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,235
- That room.
- What?

238
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,799
The panic room.

239
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,357
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,795
Fuck!

241
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,593
Coming back up!

242
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,835
That's you.

243
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,909
Shit.

244
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,989
Go!

245
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,195
Fuck!

246
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,716
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,633
Damn it! Mother...

248
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,394
Shit!

249
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,111
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,154
Shit.

251
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,117
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,314
Oh, damn.

253
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,839
- It doesn't work?
- It's a different phone line.

254
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,679
I never hooked it up.

255
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,589
Now what?

256
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,872
I can't hear a thing.

257
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,517
What do you think they want?

258
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,352
I don't know. Rob us...

259
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,439
I don't know.

260
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,039
What do we do?

261
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,199
We wait.

262
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,280
- What if they get in here?
- Well, they can't.

263
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,671
They can't get in. It's not possible.

264
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,352
Mom. I heard you.

265
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,276
- Do you feel okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,759
- You shaky?
- No.

267
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,273
- Chills?
- No.

268
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,799
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,915
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,753
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,075
Here he comes.

272
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,038
I locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,953
- Good.
- She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,156
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,276
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,397
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,074
I checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,151
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,917
- I thought she wouldn't be here.
- He said she wouldn't.

280
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,833
Fuck you! And fuck you! She is not supposed...

281
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,315
Do it.

282
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,753
Excuse me.

283
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,910
The police are on their way.

284
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,156
- She's lying.
- You're full of...

285
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,109
It's not an intercom. It's a PA system.

286
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,794
I know. I'm just scaring her.

287
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,434
I suggest you leave before they get here.

288
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,594
- What?
- He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,318
How could he know that?

290
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,630
Take what you want and get out!

291
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,517
If only it were that easy.

292
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,718
Some paper. I need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,791
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,552
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,908
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

296
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,910
"What we want is in that room"?

297
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,031
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,714
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,871
What do you know about this room?

300
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,632
What do we know about that room?

301
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,518
- Let's not tell her anything.
- Just a few details.

302
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,758
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,717
Get out of my house!

304
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,037
- Say "fuck."
- You fuck.

305
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,755
- Mom.
- What?

306
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,796
"Get the fuck out of my house."

307
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,911
Get the fuck out of my house!

308
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,558
Okay, I have an idea.

309
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,394
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,238
She won't believe you.

311
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,996
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,432
Conversation's over!

313
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,837
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,196
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,358
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,715
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,870
- What if she did call the cops?
- She didn't.

318
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,076
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,549
If cops were coming,
do you think I'd still be here?

320
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,359
Okay, fine. Good, excellent. We all believe you.

321
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,357
How do we get into that room?

322
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,431
What is funny about this?

323
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,071
Is this shit funny to you?

324
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,318
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...

325
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,591
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,310
It's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,029
We can't.

328
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,672
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,309
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,512
And why would she do that?

331
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,599
I don't know.

332
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,597
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,831
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,032
...and I don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,160
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,829
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,073
And why would they come out in the first place?

338
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,992
I'm working on that.

339
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,915
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

340
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,239
Small space?

341
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,154
I'm okay.

342
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,073
- You can't wig out.
- I know.

343
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,832
- I mean it.
- I won't.

344
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,552
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,475
I guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,674
Really?

347
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,313
Yeah, I read that.

348
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,669
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,116
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,917
What are they doing now?

351
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,638
I don't know.

352
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,432
They're locking us in.

353
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,917
This is not happening.

354
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,559
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,916
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,148
Sarah!

357
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,877
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're coming in from below.

358
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,310
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,152
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,794
We'll see.

361
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,396
Hey. This is what I do.

362
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,478
If some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,558
...do you really think that I would still have a job?

364
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,712
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,794
Neighbour.

366
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,154
Help!

367
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,475
Please help us!

368
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,070
- Call the police!
- Do you hear us?

369
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,395
Help us!

370
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,834
Help!

371
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,878
- Help us, please!
- Call the police!

372
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,319
Shit!

373
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,430
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,110
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,108
He can't get in here with a hammer, can he?

376
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,430
Could you be any louder?

377
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,276
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,673
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,197
I'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,116
- They're going to get in here.
- No, they can't get in here.

381
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,233
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,233
Oh, this is good.

383
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,313
This could work.

384
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,717
I was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,358
- Open it.
- I just did.

386
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,271
Open it some more.

387
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,115
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,753
They'll get the point.

389
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,951
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,357
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,510
- Don't be stupid.
- Quiet!

392
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,114
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,193
What is it?

394
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,829
It's bad.

395
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,193
They're coughing.

396
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,670
If they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,352
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,910
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,474
Mom.

400
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,156
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,437
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,034
Cut it back a little.

403
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,032
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,076
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,471
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,439
Turn it down.

407
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,559
Turn it down! It's too much!

408
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,438
- Don't you start up with this shit.
- Keep it down!

409
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,954
I'm turning it down.

410
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,952
- Keep his ass off of me.
- I'm not killing anybody.

411
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,914
- Tell him to turn it down!
- Turn the shit off.

412
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,560
- No.
- Turn it down.

413
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,310
- No.
- Turn it down.

414
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,951
- Mom?
- Just a second.

415
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,434
Get under this.

416
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,189
Oh, my god.

417
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,994
- Fucking amateurs, man!
- It's my fucking idea.

418
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,030
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

419
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,634
What is that?

420
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,513
Turn the gas off.

421
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,077
Turn the gas off right now.

422
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,079
Get back!

423
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,794
Shit!

424
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,834
God!

425
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,239
Get it off me!

426
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,509
It's okay.

427
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,556
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
I'm coming in there!

428
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,676
Calm the fuck down.

429
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,271
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,077
Promise me you'll never do anything like that.

431
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,188
I won't.

432
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,316
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

433
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,195
What?

434
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,119
Talk to him.

435
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,389
Please, man, give it a rest.

436
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,276
- That Morse code?
- SOS.

437
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,158
Where'd you learn that?

438
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,559
Titanic.

439
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,270
We got to talk. Downstairs.

440
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,395
No, no, no. Not you.

441
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,996
Come on, come on, come on.

442
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,468
Get up.

443
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,794
Come on.

444
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,874
Wake up.

445
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,914
The first thing I'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

446
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,074
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

447
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,878
I want a third of whatever's in that room up there.

448
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,829
Fine!

449
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,072
Okay? Full share, one-third. Congratulations.

450
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,673
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

451
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,308
Got him.

452
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,673
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

453
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,155
I'm not losing my half of the money because...

454
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,673
Slow down. Half?

455
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,639
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third...

456
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,194
Come on.

457
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,230
I'm letting you know he's a problem.

458
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,113
But this wasn't my idea, so he's your problem.

459
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,435
You're right. It wasn't your idea!

460
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,988
None of this was your idea! It was my idea!

461
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,638
Come on, look over here.

462
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,749
Yes.

463
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,794
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,515
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

465
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,152
- We're here!
- Help us!

466
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,071
We're over here!

467
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,268
Help!

468
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,476
Open your window!

469
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,834
Help!

470
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,230
We're never going to get out of here.

471
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,517
I'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

472
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,955
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

473
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,952
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

474
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,473
Are you done?

475
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,711
No. I'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

476
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,480
I'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

477
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,117
I'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

478
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,154
Wait a minute.

479
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,311
- What?
- The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

480
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,118
Two of them, on the stairs.

481
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,353
Where's the third guy?

482
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,156
I left my cell phone by the bed.

483
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,953
I earned that money.

484
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,629
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...

485
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,871
...because you have a problem relating to others!

486
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,588
Got it?

487
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,916
If I don't come back, close this door.

488
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,752
Just do what I say.

489
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,831
If he touches me again, I'll shoot him.

490
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,909
Christ!

491
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,429
Wait!

492
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,355
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

493
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,396
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

494
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,233
I'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

495
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,710
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

496
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,279
You live in Flatbush.

497
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,238
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

498
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,390
...because I saw that movie, too.

499
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,674
What is this?

500
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,198
I got some news for you.

501
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,513
Go.

502
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,113
Go!

503
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,475
Fuck!

504
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,040
She got something. What did she get?

505
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,235
No.

506
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,234
Charger!

507
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,990
She has a cell phone.

508
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,395
No!

509
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,553
All right, signal.

510
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,354
Come on. Signal.

511
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,870
I don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

512
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,160
- Why not?
- You can't call out from in there.

513
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,473
No signal.

514
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,319
I didn't hook up this line,
but I hooked up the main line.

515
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,868
If we can find it, we can cut into it.

516
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,350
I can't go to prison, man.
I'm not built for that shit.

517
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,275
Be careful.

518
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,434
Get the phone.

519
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,670
- It doesn't come off.
- Rip it off!

520
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,796
Screwdriver. Phillips.

521
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,118
Junior, when I asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

522
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,591
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

523
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,549
Shit!

524
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,310
Strip this and expose the wires.

525
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,516
- What are we doing?
- I have no idea.

526
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,080
- Okay, got it?
- Yeah. Here.

527
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,355
Okay.

528
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,318
Yellow, yellow.

529
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,115
Okay.

530
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,508
Dial tone.

531
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,388
911 Emergency.

532
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,194
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street...

533
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,352
- Please hold.
- No, no. God.

534
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,515
Call Dad.

535
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,315
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

536
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,597
- Hello?
- Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

537
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,352
- Who is this?
- It's Meg.

538
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,271
Do you know what time it is?

539
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,711
- Put him on the phone, bitch.
- It's your fucking wife.

540
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,795
Move.

541
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,830
- Hello?
- You've got to help us.

542
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,955
Move!

543
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,271
There are three men upstairs. They broke in...

544
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,549
What...

545
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,871
- He'll do something.
- No, he won't.

546
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,473
He'll call the police.

547
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,790
You don't know her. She won't let him.

548
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,111
No. He knows that there's trouble. He heard me.

549
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,111
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

550
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,555
Just in case we needed each other. He'll help us.

551
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,870
- He won't.
- Yes, he will!

552
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,948
I'm sorry.

553
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,272
No, I'm sorry.

554
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,469
Why?

555
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,631
I was trying not to tell you.

556
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,835
What?

557
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,237
I'm dizzy and hungry.

558
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,477
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

559
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,400
Looks like that gas idea didn't work out so well.

560
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,359
Whose fault was that?

561
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,793
This is impossible.

562
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,472
What's the plan now, hot rod?

563
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,279
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

564
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,559
Here, drink this.

565
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,471
All right, drink lots of water.

566
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,791
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

567
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,359
Can you hear me okay?

568
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,158
I'm just dizzy, not deaf.

569
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,190
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

570
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,398
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

571
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,114
Let's check it again.

572
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,553
Mom, I did it.

573
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,677
We got to stay calm, okay?

574
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,832
If we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

575
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,592
You're making me nervous.

576
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,238
I'm sorry.

577
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,478
What if I keep dropping?

578
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,233
You won't. I'll figure something out.

579
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,353
You know, he's right.

580
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,435
There's no way we're getting into that room.

581
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,272
What are you talking about?

582
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,119
I just got to be honest with myself here.

583
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,432
I don't need to be involved...

584
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,149
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

585
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,038
- You're giving up?
- Hell, yes.

586
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,835
I don't need the fucking aggravation.
I'll make an anonymous phone call.

587
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,913
They'll find the floor safe. I'll inherit.

588
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,791
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

589
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,190
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

590
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,313
Fuck, I'll still put away 800 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

591
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,112
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

592
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,598
Wait a minute.

593
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,670
Say what you just said again.

594
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,993
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes.

595
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,350
When? Before?

596
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,908
Yeah, before.

597
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,039
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

598
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,473
What are you doing?

599
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,439
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

600
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,069
So now you're a tax attorney.

601
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,757
- I'm out of here.
- Wait a minute.

602
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,272
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

603
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,913
Where else?

604
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,278
Travel kit.

605
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,033
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

606
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,634
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe.

607
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,757
A fuckup like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

608
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,035
...so now I don't know what to think.

609
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,873
You're adding up money you'll never touch,
buddy.

610
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,551
How much is in there?

611
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,999
Mouthwash.

612
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,909
Saccharin.

613
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,114
Hey, I'm talking to you. Answer me.

614
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,039
Fine. There's more.

615
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,592
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

616
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,433
It doesn't matter now. It's totally fucking moot!

617
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,798
- Why are we having this conversation?
- What were you thinking?

618
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,269
How did you expect to get away with this?

619
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,351
Did you think that I'd open that safe...

620
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,115
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

621
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,352
What's the matter with you?

622
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,352
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

623
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,955
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

624
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,634
Your eyes were huge
when I told you about the gig...

625
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,438
...so don't play innocent.

626
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,591
Things didn't work out.

627
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,518
Play past it.

628
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,440
Mints? Sugar-free.

629
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,156
Mints? Sugar-free.

630
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,630
I'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

631
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,551
It's looking doubtful there, big guy.

632
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,315
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don't ever want to see you again.

633
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,995
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

634
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,236
...and we will fucking find you.

635
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,078
I'll see you, Burnham.

636
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,229
Later, Raoul.

637
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,469
Mom!

638
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,031
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

639
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,236
...think you know all about it.

640
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,070
You don't know nothing about me.

641
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,999
Sarah, listen to me.

642
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,914
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

643
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,989
Okay.

644
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,829
You should see the look on your face.

645
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,553
What's happening?

646
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,837
- Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
- No, don't.

647
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,234
Come here.

648
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,594
Come here.

649
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,474
- Don't shoot, please.
- Come on.

650
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,792
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it.

651
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,149
- Stop it, you fucking...
- Fucking what?

652
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,671
Clown? Idiot? Fucking asshole?

653
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,832
Who's the clown now?

654
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,115
Me.

655
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,428
That's right.

656
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,598
It's burning me.

657
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,159
Who's got the gun?

658
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,715
You.

659
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,874
Remember that.

660
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,797
Find out who the fuck that is.

661
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,039
Give me your wallet.

662
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,713
Give me your wallet.

663
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,792
Stephan Altman.

664
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,959
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

665
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,793
What did she say?

666
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,591
Don't know. Cut off.

667
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,314
- Phones are dead.
- Did you call anybody else?

668
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,478
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

669
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,869
No.

670
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,958
He's telling the truth.

671
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,395
Yeah.

672
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,113
Yeah, he probably is.

673
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,874
Because when I do this, people don't lie.

674
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,309
What?

675
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,589
- What do you want?
- Get us into that room.

676
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,318
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

677
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,872
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

678
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,110
You want me to just make something up?

679
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,316
You've got till the count of three.

680
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,829
Then you end up like Junior over there.

681
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,595
- One, squeeze.
- This is ridiculous.

682
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,749
Two, squeeze.

683
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,353
I don't know what to tell you.

684
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,589
- Three.
- Wait!

685
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,349
Okay.

686
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,592
I got an idea.

687
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,195
Maybe.

688
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,709
Maybe.

689
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,040
Help! , Rubber Soul...

690
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,998
Help! , Rubber Soul...

691
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,516
...Yesterday and Today,
Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album...

692
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,797
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

693
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,999
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper...

694
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,349
Oh, god!

695
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,392
Dad?

696
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,674
No, no.

697
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,953
Take it easy.

698
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,036
Open the door! Open the door!

699
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,709
No.

700
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,951
Don't open the door!

701
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,438
- Just make it look good.
- Don't you tell me what...

702
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,952
Open the door!

703
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,119
Don't open...

704
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,792
Knock it off!

705
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,872
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

706
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,509
Oh, god.

707
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,679
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

708
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,114
Lie down.

709
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,549
All right.

710
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,791
You'll be fine. Come on.

711
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,875
He's fucking crazy.

712
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,396
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

713
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,948
You're a strong girl.

714
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,316
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

715
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,593
Get the fuck off him, now! Just get off him!

716
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,632
It's almost over.

717
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,396
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

718
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,235
All right, turn around.

719
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,038
I'll be right back.

720
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,993
It's got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

721
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,308
Get your tapes.

722
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,679
Who's this?

723
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,314
It's her kid.

724
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,159
What happened to her?

725
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,830
Who gives a fuck?

726
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,156
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

727
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,713
Hey, lady.

728
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,709
Mom?

729
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,113
What are you doing?

730
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,318
What are you doing?

731
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,473
We've got your kid.

732
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,959
Come down here.

733
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,712
Let's get this over with.

734
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,753
Get her, get her!

735
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,234
Shit!

736
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,349
What happened?

737
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,396
No! Let her out!

738
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,912
- Where's your gun?
- Open the door.

739
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,274
No!

740
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,118
- Where's your gun?
- I don't know.

741
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,758
Open up!

742
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,154
Open it.

743
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,599
Shut up! Listen to me. She's got your gun.

744
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,118
She's got your gun!

745
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,069
Stop screaming. Stop it.

746
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,918
I know you've got the gun.

747
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,674
Put the gun down and step away from the door.

748
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,276
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

749
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,351
She needs an injection.

750
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,628
Do you hear me?

751
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,195
Open the door so I can give her a shot.

752
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,679
Or I swear to God, I'll kill you both.

753
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,430
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.

754
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,594
So give her the shot yourself.

755
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,592
Give her the shot!

756
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,519
Do you need this?

757
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,438
Can you do this yourself?

758
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,950
What happens if you don't get it?

759
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,519
Coma.

760
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,069
Die.

761
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,954
Fuck! Open it.

762
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,029
Put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.

763
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,635
And I'll give her the shot, all right?

764
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,711
I told you to leave the gun!

765
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,155
Shit.

766
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,351
You fucking bitch!

767
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,671
If you pull any shit like that again,
I will fucking kill her.

768
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,439
Do you hear me?

769
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,673
If you step outside, I'll kill her!

770
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,600
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'll cut her fucking throat!

771
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,599
Do you understand?

772
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,389
Yes.

773
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,830
But please, just give her the shot.

774
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,795
Please.

775
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,029
Please.

776
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,713
Don't fucking do it.

777
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,634
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

778
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,631
Are you going to open the safe?

779
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,672
Don't you look at me.

780
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,309
All I know about this is what I see on TV.

781
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,391
You got to talk me through this.

782
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,314
This right here?

783
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,475
It's this?

784
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,115
Yeah, okay.

785
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,791
Nice house you guys got.

786
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,918
Your mom's rich.

787
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,551
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

788
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,788
Tap it.

789
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,269
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this.

790
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,078
It's not that I didn't try.

791
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,749
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

792
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,399
Done.

793
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,116
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

794
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,872
He had it all worked out.

795
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,635
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

796
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,549
Thanks...

797
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,875
...Burnham.

798
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,276
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

799
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,358
She's going to be okay.

800
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,469
I gave her the shot. She's all right.

801
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,672
It'll be over soon.

802
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,189
Stephan.

803
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,078
Oh, my god.

804
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,673
Can you move?

805
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,916
Not much. I think my arm is broken.

806
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,714
Raise your arm.

807
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,998
Come on, raise your arm.

808
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,719
Try again.

809
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,356
Come on. Try again.

810
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,875
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

811
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,516
They're going to kill us.

812
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,114
Just do everything they ask.
It'll be okay that way.

813
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,760
Stephan, they'll kill her.

814
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,638
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

815
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,359
The police.

816
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,599
You called the police?

817
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,477
Of course, I called them.

818
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,513
You scared the shit out of me.

819
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,113
She killed the kid.

820
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,230
She just killed her own kid.

821
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,679
All right, take this.

822
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,193
Don't say a word.

823
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,031
No, her husband must have called them.

824
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,839
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!

825
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,678
Where is she?

826
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,789
There.

827
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,478
What the fuck's she doing?

828
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,998
She's going to handle it.

829
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,956
I'm just trying to unlock...

830
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,838
- Is everything okay?
- You all right, ma'am?

831
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,957
What are you... What time is it?

832
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,477
It's a little after 4:00 a.m.

833
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,039
We got a call, ma'am.

834
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,593
Somebody called you?

835
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,468
Can we come in?

836
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,119
What do you want?

837
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,237
- We'd like to come in.
- No, you can't come in.

838
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,750
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

839
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,474
I'm fine.

840
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,557
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

841
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,950
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

842
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,991
Come on, I'm freezing out here.

843
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,113
"There are three."

844
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,429
What?

845
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,595
Your husband said you called for help.

846
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,475
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

847
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,432
Oh, that phone call.

848
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,751
And your neighbours...

849
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:45,436
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

850
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,071
That was the TV. It's off now.

851
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,790
Can I just ask you one question?

852
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,075
What was the end of that sentence?

853
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,996
When you said, "There are three"...

854
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,639
...what was the rest?

855
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,075
Look...

856
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,670
My husband and I just split up...

857
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:20,510
...and it's my first night in a new house...

858
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,916
...and I admit I was a little drunk.

859
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,470
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...

860
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,073
...was going to be:

861
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,796
"There are three things that I'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

862
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:46,270
Thank God I came to my senses
before I said all that, and I hung up...

863
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,872
...so nobody would ever have to know
what I was thinking.

864
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,393
Unless, of course...

865
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,752
...two policemen came,
in the middle of the night, and interrogated me.

866
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,592
So, Rick, you want to go?

867
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,918
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

868
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,109
All right.

869
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,389
Ma'am...

870
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,479
...if there's something you want to say to us...

871
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,996
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

872
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,073
...you might want to make some kind of a signal...

873
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,437
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

874
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,672
Something like that.

875
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,595
That's something you could do safely.

876
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,995
Man...

877
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,031
...you guys are good.

878
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,235
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

879
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,549
They really train you guys.

880
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,709
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Cross my heart.

881
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,110
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

882
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,154
'Night, ma'am.

883
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,272
This kid has seen my face.

884
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,990
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

885
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,038
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

886
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,232
You're on the hook, too.

887
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,112
Do one. Same price for the rest.

888
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,674
Stay the fuck away from me.

889
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,630
You know how this is going to end.

890
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,549
Goddamn!

891
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,909
What's up?

892
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,831
Why the hell didn't we do that?

893
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,790
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

894
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,714
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

895
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,077
Just let me drill, man.

896
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,674
Empty?

897
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,069
Come on, man.

898
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,718
Bank bonds.

899
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,875
One second.

900
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,078
Two, three, four, five...

901
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,152
Why are we doing this?

902
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,630
Because it's going to come to that.

903
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,113
There are 22.

904
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,111
$22 million.

905
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,840
That lying little shit!

906
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,998
Let's get out of here.

907
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,352
Lift.

908
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:19,830
Leave that. Christ, I'll buy you new tools.

909
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,839
You'll be okay.

910
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,430
It's glass. I got you. Come on.

911
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,629
Hurry up.

912
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,392
Watch the glass.

913
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,394
Get down here.

914
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,435
Wait.

915
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,508
Wait. You don't want to do that.

916
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,079
Dad, don't shoot him!

917
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,119
Let my daughter go.

918
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,555
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

919
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,557
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

920
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,433
Let her go.

921
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:12,675
Okay.

922
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,269
It's okay.

923
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,235
Let's go.

924
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,989
Let's go.

925
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,030
Just let her go. Let her go.

926
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,348
Let go of her!

927
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,108
Put that gun down.

928
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,156
- Sarah, come here.
- Put that gun down!

929
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,633
- Do as I say.
- Don't be crazy, man.

930
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,036
- Just let her go.
- Let her go!

931
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,754
Are you okay?

932
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,473
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

933
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,516
- Did they touch you?
- No.

934
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,956
Stephan, shoot him. Shoot him!

935
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,470
Get off her!

936
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,118
You'll be okay now.

937
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,631
- Police!
- Don't move!

938
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,149
- Nobody move!
- Everybody on the ground!

939
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,676
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.

940
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,954
Are you okay?

941
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,839
Are you all right?

942
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,436
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

943
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,395
Don't move! I will kill you!

944
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,193
Move away from the wall!

945
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,158
Get off the fence! Move!

946
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,916
Put your hands in the air!

947
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,156
It'll be okay. It's fine, Dad.

948
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,356
Is there anybody else in the house?

949
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,669
No.

950
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:51,589
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.

951
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,794
It's okay. I'm all right.

952
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,110
I want to see the palms of your hands!

953
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,431
Do you hear me? Open your hands!

954
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:25,396
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.

955
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,590
Everything is going to be fine.

956
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,758
