1
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:03,454
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

2
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,873
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

3
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,793
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

4
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,921
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.

5
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:14,678
Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.

6
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,258
If he ever gets out.

7
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,891
Loras Tyrell?

8
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,099
Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the queen.

9
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,943
I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of them.

10
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,316
How good could he be?

11
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:31,533
He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,
and Renly ain't dead.

12
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,166
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

13
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,796
They're horses.

14
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,498
They get spooked by their own shadows.

15
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,137
Do you hear that?

16
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:56,010
No.

17
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,099
There's something out there.

18
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,168
Oh.

19
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,208
Oh, you're a right little prick.

20
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:27,791
You should see your face.

21
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:29,958
I swear you pissed yourself.

22
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,044
"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

23
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,341
There is something out there.

24
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,506
Yeah, don't even try me.

25
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,139
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

26
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:41,769
Rennick!

27
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,818
King in the North!
The King in the North!

28
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,674
Five Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

29
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,590
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

30
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,305
We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.

31
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,217
Barely enough food to feed our own.

32
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,219
We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

33
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,890
Of course, Your Grace.

34
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,472
The officers will be useful.

35
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,562
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

36
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:31,732
I doubt it.

37
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,280
Well, we'll learn soon enough.

38
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,447
In my family, we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

39
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,327
"A flayed man none."

40
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,405
My father outlawed flaying in the North.

41
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,618
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

42
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,619
The high road's very pretty,

43
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,419
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

44
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,252
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.

45
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:56,386
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

46
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,927
No, don't! Don't! Please!

47
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,721
The rot's set in.

48
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,723
No, don't! No, don't!

49
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,980
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

50
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,896
It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.

51
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:16,905
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now...

52
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,734
No, you can't!

53
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,036
Ser! Please, ser.

54
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,617
- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she doesn't.

55
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,666
I don't want to be a cripple, please.

56
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,587
Surely one of our men
needs your attention more than this cub.

57
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,001
Your men are not my men, my lord.

58
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,628
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

59
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,209
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

60
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,505
It's better than biting your own tongue,
believe me.

61
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,589
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

62
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,629
Your last name?

63
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,003
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

64
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:24,008
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

65
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,721
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

66
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,308
They killed my father.

67
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,221
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

68
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,062
Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?

69
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,983
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

70
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:41,108
He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

71
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,192
I have no hatred for the lad.

72
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:46,609
That should help his foot grow back.

73
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:53,658
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

74
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,708
I understand. The country would be at peace

75
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:00,132
and life would be just under
the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.

76
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,006
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the gods give me strength.

77
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,303
- And then what?
- I don't know.

78
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,551
We'll go back to Winterfell.

79
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,268
I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,974
So who will?

81
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,940
I don't know.

82
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,228
You're fighting to overthrow a king,

83
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,695
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

84
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:21,152
First we have to win the war.

85
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,952
You never told me where you're from.

86
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,993
- Volantis.
- Volantis? You're far from home.

87
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,077
The boy was lucky you were here.

88
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:38,378
He was unlucky that you were.

89
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,142
You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.

90
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,182
Your Grace,

91
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,437
whatever my traitor brother has done,
I had no part.

92
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:56,935
You know that. I beg you, please...

93
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,769
Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

94
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,521
Using some vile sorcery,

95
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,566
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

96
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,572
Thousands of good men were butchered.

97
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,824
After the slaughter,
the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.

98
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,497
Killing you
would send your brother a message.

99
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:21,545
But my mother insists on keeping you alive.

100
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,212
Stand.

101
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,421
So we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.

102
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,642
Meryn.

103
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,980
Leave her face. I like her pretty.

104
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,698
Meryn, my lady is overdressed.

105
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,072
Unburden her.

106
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,047
If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder.

107
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,834
What is the meaning of this?

108
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,136
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

109
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,353
The kind who serves his king, Imp.

110
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,607
Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
all over your pretty white cloak.

111
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,518
Someone get the girl
something to cover herself with.

112
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,938
She is to be your queen.

113
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,693
Have you no regard for her honour?

114
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,026
I'm punishing her.
For what crimes?

115
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,278
She did not fight her brother's battle,
you half-wit.

116
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,123
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

117
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,950
The Mad King did as he liked.

118
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,082
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you
what happened to him?

119
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:45,091
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

120
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.

121
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,966
Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.

122
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,346
That was a threat. See the difference?

123
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,336
I apologise for my nephew's behaviour.

124
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:26,875
Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?

125
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,170
I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.

126
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:38,512
Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

127
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,025
The little king's backed up.

128
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,769
Clogged from balls to brains.

129
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,074
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

130
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:53,530
There's no cure for being a cunt.

131
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,279
But the boy's at that age.

132
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,954
And he's got nothing to do all day
but pick wings off flies.

133
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,711
Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

134
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,177
What are you doing here, dog?

135
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:16,723
Your uncle left your nameday present
and asked me to see that you got it.

136
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,223
And?

137
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,474
What is it?

138
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,267
Look inside, Your Grace.

139
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,950
Your Grace.

140
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,954
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

141
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,411
We won't tell if you won't.

142
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,409
No.

143
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,126
Her.

144
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,045
Touch her.

145
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,324
Could you hit her?

146
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,458
My uncle sent you?

147
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,962
Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

148
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,589
Hmm.

149
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,474
Use this.

150
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:00,942
Harder.

151
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,829
I said harder.

152
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:14,294
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

153
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,380
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

154
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,060
Please, Your Grace.

155
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:14,818
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...

156
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,860
Oh, I want him to find out.

157
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,697
You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished

158
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,527
and show him what you've done,

159
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,738
or the same thing will happen to you.

160
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,838
Begin.

161
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:44,974
Harder!

162
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,279
Well, if it isn't my favourite whoremonger.

163
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:03,069
Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

164
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,029
Your Grace.

165
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,494
Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
is that it?

166
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:18,962
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

167
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,135
I'm a practical man.

168
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,804
Just not a loyal one.

169
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,550
And who would you have me be loyal to?

170
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,511
Your brother's corpse?

171
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:33,643
I don't like you, Lord Baelish.

172
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,684
I don't like your face.

173
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,528
I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.

174
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,441
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

175
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,941
So tell me, why are you here?

176
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:51,495
You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.

177
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,291
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

178
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,208
many who believe Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

179
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,839
Now I understand.

180
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:11,392
You know I have the numbers.
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.

181
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:15,183
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

182
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,353
And your head.

183
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,394
I would give priority to my head.

184
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:26,151
I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,

185
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,775
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

186
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:32,455
When you march on King's Landing,

187
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,660
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

188
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,879
open gates.

189
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,731
Your Grace.

190
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,276
Lord Baelish.

191
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,857
All of these tents look the same to me.

192
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,273
- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.

193
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,734
It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.

194
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,244
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

195
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:17,376
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
we're on the move again.

196
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,085
"Your tent"?

197
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:21,081
Not "Our tent"?

198
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,255
The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?

199
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,002
Pressures of command, no doubt.

200
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,423
Four kings vying for the throne.

201
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,678
I am not tutored in warfare,

202
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,601
but basic arithmetic
favours the side with the greater numbers.

203
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:42,605
If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.

204
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:46,817
I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent just now.

205
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,029
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the king's side.

206
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:53,411
And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?

207
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,870
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

208
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:58,537
Your marriage is quite interesting.

209
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:01,415
Not only to me, but to the realm.

210
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:06,791
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest, if nothing else.

211
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,886
You've never married, have you?

212
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:13,297
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

213
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,219
That is sad.

214
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,722
Though perhaps it's for the best.

215
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:19,805
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

216
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,815
so allow me to explain.

217
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:25,394
My husband is my king,
and my king is my husband.

218
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,989
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

219
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,642
This isn't your horse.

220
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,610
It was given to me by the Thirteen.

221
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,198
The Elders of Qarth.

222
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:12,606
Qarth?

223
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,154
Three days to the east, on the sea.

224
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:18,367
Will they let us in?

225
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,240
They said they would be honoured
to receive the Mother of Dragons.

226
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,505
What do you know of this place?

227
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:31,626
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.

228
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:36,924
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveller,

229
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,559
the garden grows.

230
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,866
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

231
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,077
Bring her about!

232
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,409
What kind of fire melts stone?

233
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,630
Dragon fire.

234
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,372
There's dragons here?

235
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,006
No, all the dragons are dead.

236
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,091
What's that smell?

237
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,765
Dead people.

238
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:20,805
Move.

239
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,396
Please, please, no, no!

240
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,116
No.

241
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:53,170
He's dead.

242
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:57,173
He was my son.

243
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:01,971
My sister was three days ago.

244
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:05,844
My husband, the day before that.

245
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:09,395
They take someone every day?

246
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,319
Does anyone live?

247
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:38,376
Joffrey.

248
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:40,795
Cersei.

249
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,053
Ilyn Payne.

250
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,888
The Hound.

251
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,723
Joffrey.

252
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:49,227
Cersei.

253
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,895
Ilyn Payne.

254
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:53,730
The Hound.

255
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,521
Joffrey. Cersei.

256
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,232
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

257
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:05,910
How dare you?

258
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,998
You may have heard false reports.

259
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,284
- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?

260
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:12,169
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

261
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,046
I begged him to seize the moment.

262
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,501
I trusted you. My husband trusted you.

263
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:21,429
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

264
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,593
- No, my lady.
- Get out!

265
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,094
Cat, I've...

266
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:27,433
I've loved you since I was a boy.

267
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,516
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...

268
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,264
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

269
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,410
Do you want to see your girls again?

270
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,922
Sansa, more beautiful than ever?

271
00:22:56,716 --> 00:23:00,050
And Arya, just as wild as ever?

272
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:02,763
You have Arya, too?

273
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,798
Both girls are healthy and safe.

274
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,342
For now.

275
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:13,225
But you know the queen
and you know Joffrey.

276
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:18,440
I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.

277
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:41,916
What do you want?

278
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:46,551
The Lannisters will trade your daughters
for the Kingslayer.

279
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,384
Of course they will.

280
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:50,848
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

281
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:53,181
Robb will never agree to those terms.

282
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:55,431
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

283
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:56,805
I'm bringing them to you.

284
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,560
You think I keep secrets from my son?

285
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:02,323
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

286
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,438
but he's not a mother.

287
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,361
Consider it, Cat.

288
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:10,201
You may not get another chance.

289
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,124
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

290
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:20,000
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

291
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:24,335
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

292
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,591
is offered in good faith.

293
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,056
Good faith?

294
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,267
What's this?

295
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:06,086
Your husband was an honourable man.

296
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,597
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

297
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:17,727
- You may not believe...
- Get out.

298
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,467
Get up, you dogs!

299
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,984
That's him, the one who picks.

300
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:08,980
The Mountain.

301
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:13,703
What are you doing?

302
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,406
He told me he stares at him every day.

303
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,491
That's why he doesn't get picked.

304
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,147
You.

305
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:47,821
Move, boy!

306
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,687
Move!

307
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,795
Is there gold and silver
in the village?

308
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,761
- I don't know.
- Gems?

309
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,474
I didn't see any.

310
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,598
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

311
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:37,402
Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

312
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,405
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

313
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,082
Which of the villagers aided them?

314
00:27:48,257 --> 00:27:49,917
- I don't know.
- Who?

315
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,374
I...

316
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:57,757
- Who?
- I never saw.

317
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,559
- Who?
- I never saw.

318
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,013
Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to...

319
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:05,312
- Who?
- I didn't see anyone help him.

320
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,566
Take it off! Take it off!

321
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,108
- Who helped him?
- Ganes, the butcher,

322
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:12,857
- And his son.
- That's better.

323
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,987
- You've been very helpful.
- No, stop, please!

324
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,574
What are you doing? Please, stop!

325
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,951
Please, stop! No! No!

326
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,413
I told you everything! No!

327
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,458
No!

328
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,875
Joffrey.

329
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:31,629
Cersei.

330
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,626
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

331
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:37,295
Please, Polliver. Some food.

332
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,848
Just a crust of bread.

333
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,558
Polliver.

334
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:47,941
The Mountain.

335
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:08,705
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

336
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:11,839
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

337
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,249
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

338
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,509
When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.

339
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,055
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

340
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:26,053
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

341
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,645
Why is your stag on fire?

342
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:33,903
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

343
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:37,986
Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

344
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:40,201
Mmm, brother,

345
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,444
now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.

346
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,029
Watch yourself, Renly.

347
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:47,166
No, no, I'm relieved.

348
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,499
I never really believed you were a fanatic.

349
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:53,465
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,

350
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,382
but not a godly man.

351
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,125
You should kneel before your brother.

352
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,130
He's the Lord's chosen,

353
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,550
born amidst salt and smoke.

354
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,428
Born amidst salt and smoke?

355
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:08,052
- Is he a ham?
That's twice I've warned you.

356
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,932
Listen to yourselves.

357
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,985
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together

358
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:16,734
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.

359
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:19,396
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

360
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,115
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

361
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:24,237
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

362
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:27,321
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

363
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,958
We share a common enemy.

364
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:31,921
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

365
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,046
All those that deny that are my foes.

366
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:39,631
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

367
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,505
Old men deny it with their death rattle

368
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:43,922
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

369
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,471
No one wants you for their king.

370
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,429
You never wanted any friends, brother.

371
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:53,854
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

372
00:30:55,152 --> 00:31:00,063
For the sake of the mother who bore us,
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

373
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:04,658
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

374
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:08,574
and I will grant you
your old seat in the Council.

375
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,576
I'll even name you my heir

376
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:13,916
until a son is born to me.

377
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,249
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

378
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,972
Look across those fields, brother.

379
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,843
Can you see all those banners?

380
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:29,342
You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?

381
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,468
No.

382
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,691
The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.

383
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,853
We shall see, Renly.

384
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:39,102
Come the dawn, we shall see.

385
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,772
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

386
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,942
The night is dark and full of terrors.

387
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:52,958
Would you believe I loved him once?

388
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:15,807
I thought we were welcome.

389
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,474
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

390
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,396
you might do the same, Khaleesi.

391
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,153
Horde?

392
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,916
My name is Daenerys...

393
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:44,844
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

394
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,055
You know me, my lord?

395
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,262
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

396
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:52,720
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

397
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:57,185
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

398
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:58,935
And what should I call you?

399
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:00,641
Oh, my name is quite long

400
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:03,405
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

401
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:06,491
I am simply a trader of spices.

402
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,912
But we are the Thirteen,

403
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,906
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

404
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,125
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

405
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:22,045
- The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

406
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:26,090
Qarth.

407
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,713
Might we see the dragons?

408
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,642
My friend,

409
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,891
we have travelled very far.

410
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,190
We have no food, no water.

411
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,935
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honoured...

412
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:47,397
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

413
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:51,243
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

414
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:54,120
Some of my more sceptical friends

415
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:57,409
refuse to believe your children

416
00:33:58,127 --> 00:33:59,502
even exist.

417
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:02,588
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

418
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,914
I am not a liar.

419
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,048
Oh, I don't think you are.

420
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:08,636
But as I've never met you before,

421
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:11,294
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

422
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,260
Where I come from,

423
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,264
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

424
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,644
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

425
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:26,361
We wish you well.

426
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,027
What are you doing?

427
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,444
You promised to receive me.

428
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:37,290
We have received you.

429
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,622
Here we are, and here you are.

430
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:43,835
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

431
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,289
Which we shall deeply regret.

432
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:49,879
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

433
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,220
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

434
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:02,721
Khaleesi, please be careful.

435
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,642
Thirteen!

436
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:13,826
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

437
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,117
and destroy those who have wronged me.

438
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:20,783
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

439
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:25,203
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

440
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,091
Ah.

441
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,500
You are a true Targaryen.

442
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,553
Only, as you said a moment ago,

443
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,046
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

444
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,840
And so...

445
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:42,727
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

446
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,273
that ever was or will be.

447
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,941
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

448
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,772
The Thirteen have spoken.

449
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,023
I am one of the Thirteen,

450
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,195
and I am still speaking.

451
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:57,534
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

452
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:00,539
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

453
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,866
She is the Mother of Dragons.

454
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:08,205
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

455
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,998
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

456
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:13,631
through our gates without dooming our city.

457
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,760
After all, here I am,

458
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,722
a savage from the Summer Isles,
and Qarth still stands.

459
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:23,310
Our decision is final.

460
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:25,559
Very well.

461
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,146
I invoke soumai.

462
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:40,241
I will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

463
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,587
Be it on your head.

464
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:52,749
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

465
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:43,722
You.

466
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,943
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

467
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:59,400
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

468
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,191
I don't know what that is.

469
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:34,647
You two.
Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

470
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:36,571
What's this?

471
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:39,941
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

472
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,986
Evidently not.

473
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:45,788
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

474
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,161
Cells are overflowing, my lord.

475
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,412
This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

476
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,298
After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...

477
00:38:55,924 --> 00:39:00,088
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

478
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:02,301
able young bodies and skilled labourers?

479
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:14,563
You, do you have a trade?

480
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,351
Smith, my lord.

481
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,197
What are you looking at? Kneel!

482
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:26,072
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

483
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,447
He'll do no such thing.

484
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,782
This one's a girl, you idiot,

485
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,874
dressed as a boy.

486
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,753
- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.

487
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:38,837
Smart.

488
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:40,885
More than I can say for this lot.

489
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,925
Get these prisoners to work.

490
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:45,254
Bring the girl.

491
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:47,719
I need a new cupbearer.

492
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,258
My lord.

493
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,735
Your visits are too few, cousin.

494
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:00,351
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,

495
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,819
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

496
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,239
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

497
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:08,409
Will you take a cup with me?

498
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:11,416
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

499
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,786
I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, Imp.

500
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:18,631
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

501
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,293
I would have thought she'd come herself.

502
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:23,879
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?

503
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,714
I don't care what you make of it,

504
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:28,475
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

505
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:32,259
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

506
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,598
As I said several times.

507
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,441
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

508
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:40,898
When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

509
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,656
Cersei must have great trust in you,

510
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:51,321
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.

511
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:58,625
The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.

512
00:40:58,714 --> 00:41:00,208
She often works from dusk till dawn.

513
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:04,510
She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusk till dawn.

514
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,211
Ah.

515
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:08,468
Lavender oil.

516
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,964
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

517
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,553
I am a knight!

518
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,227
An anointed knight, yes.

519
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:20,147
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

520
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,860
What? Nothing to say?

521
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,067
No more warnings for me, ser?

522
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:27,866
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

523
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:31,534
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

524
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,706
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

525
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:40,284
It's not my fault!

526
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,954
Did she take you against your will?

527
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,043
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

528
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,338
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the king's squire,

529
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,506
he told me to obey her in everything.

530
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,426
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

531
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:55,518
I only meant I did as I was bid.

532
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:57,305
Hated every moment of it,

533
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:59,141
is that what you'll have me believe?

534
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,475
A high place in court, a knighthood,

535
00:42:01,568 --> 00:42:03,774
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

536
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:06,020
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

537
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:08,024
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

538
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:12,192
- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

539
00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:14,863
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the queen.

540
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:16,658
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

541
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,870
- No, I think not.
- My lord?

542
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:21,791
You heard me.

543
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:28,920
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

544
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:31,675
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

545
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:34,256
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

546
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,811
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

547
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:43,023
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

548
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:48,028
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

549
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,403
And you will tell me.

550
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:52,905
Yes, my lord, I will.

551
00:42:53,578 --> 00:42:55,037
I swear it, as you command.

552
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,414
Oh, rise, rise.

553
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:03,922
Let us drink to our understanding.

554
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,538
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

555
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:11,339
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good of the realm.

556
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:13,927
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

557
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:16,055
that I want no more conflict between us

558
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:19,761
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

559
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:21,100
But her demands?

560
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:23,771
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

561
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:26,483
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

562
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,104
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.

563
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:33,022
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

564
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:36,285
but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

565
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,425
Stay within one table length.

566
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,969
Your Grace.

567
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:04,806
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

568
00:44:07,736 --> 00:44:11,021
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

569
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:13,232
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

570
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,234
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

571
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:18,487
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

572
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:22,166
Never understood why you had to wear them.

573
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:26,042
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

574
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,082
It reminds me of your justice.

575
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:30,842
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

576
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,214
You were a hero and a smuggler.

577
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:38,839
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

578
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:42,759
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

579
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,930
- Does he listen?
- To me?

580
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:46,268
Gods, no.

581
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:50,231
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

582
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,029
She has a name.

583
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:58,285
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

584
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,450
I've lived within the law for 17...

585
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,747
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

586
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,330
Any shore, any night.

587
00:45:07,963 --> 00:45:09,291
What am I bringing ashore?

588
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:10,875
The red woman.

589
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:16,591
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

590
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,716
I am true to Your Grace and always will be,

591
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,973
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

592
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:25,762
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

593
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,758
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

594
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:04,385
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

595
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:08,849
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

596
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:15,855
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

597
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:19,316
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

598
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:23,071
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

599
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:26,489
A man is good or he is evil.

600
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:28,416
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

601
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:34,622
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

602
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,417
Well, that must be very nice for you.

603
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,732
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

604
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,654
Yet you have known other women.

605
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:02,450
Don't talk about my wife.

606
00:47:02,577 --> 00:47:05,246
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

607
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,623
Like me, Ser Davos.

608
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,790
You want me.

609
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:17,795
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

610
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:21,970
And you will.

611
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:31,305
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

612
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,733
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

613
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:39,901
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

614
00:47:40,865 --> 00:47:44,234
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

615
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:46,818
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

616
00:47:48,456 --> 00:47:50,663
They can't bar our passage.

617
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,458
Gods protect us.

618
00:47:57,882 --> 00:48:00,171
There's only one God, Ser Davos,

619
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,836
and he only protects those who serve him.
