1
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,708
We have managed to stabilize
the God Particle and the resulting mass.

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,875
In a stable state,
it seems to create a kind of portal

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,166
which possibly allows for time travel.

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,250
If the matter is supplied
with sufficient voltage,

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,083
it can be kept in a stable state
in the long term.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:31,208
Sending objects through the stabilized
matter has already proved possible.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,041
A generator has to supply
sufficient AC current for that.

8
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,083
Even after lengthy observation,

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,083
we are not sure what the energy source
of the instable matter is.

10
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,208
Measurements indicate

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,208
there is no form of energy loss.

12
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,208
It appears to be a type
of self-sustaining recursive system.

13
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,375
The matter's radiation levels
exceed control values.

14
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,791
Still, no signs of decay
have been observed.

15
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,250
This is consistent
with the law of conservation of energy,

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,125
yet contradicts
the second law of thermodynamics.

17
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:32,125
Moreover, the matter seems to exist,
independent of external temperature,

18
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:36,333
in solid, liquid 
and gaseous states at once.

19
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,541
And the molecules seem to be
in a constant cycle...

00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,041
Hey, sleepyhead.
We're running a bit late today.

25
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,750
Come on, everything will be fine.

26
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,583
Just one more week
and it's summer vacation.

27
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,833
It's my mother's birthday today.

28
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,583
You know what we said about that.

29
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,875
The past is the past...

30
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,500
...and now is now.

31
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,041
Shall we?

32
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,625
Come on.

33
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,875
Regina, you'll be late!

34
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,875
The French delegation
is visiting the plant. I just can't do it.

35
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,416
No problem.
I don't have anything else to do.

36
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,625
-Regina!
-I really can do this more often.

37
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,916
Regina!

38
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,041
Where did you find this little one?

39
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,875
-Looks like Gretchen.
-Nonsense.

40
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,625
Regina, where are you?

41
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,250
Listen.

42
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,125
I actually wanted to talk to you.

43
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,291
There's something I have to tell you.

44
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,041
Hi, Grandpa. Can we go?

45
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,916
No need to say bye. No problem!

46
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,291
You wanted to tell me something?

47
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
Never mind.

48
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,083
All right. See you later.

00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
Thus the world was created.

54
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,416
The interview with Mrs. Tiedemann.

55
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
-Already forgotten?
-No.

56
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,541
I thought you might do it alone after all.

57
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,958
Why? Do you have something better to do?

58
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,791
No. I just wonder
why we're starting with Mrs. Tiedemann.

59
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,583
She has no link
to any of the missing people.

60
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:18,333
Everyone disappeared near the caves
and the nuclear power plant grounds.

61
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:24,750
Your colleague Ulrich Nielsen's brother
disappeared in that area in 1986 as well.

62
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,333
And then...

63
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:31,166
there's also the door in the caves
leading right to the nuclear power plant.

64
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,041
How long have Aleksander Tiedemann
and his wife been married?

65
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,083
I don't exactly know.

66
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,875
Regina was... in her mid-twenties.

67
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,458
Why?

68
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,291
Don't you find it unusual?

69
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,750
What?

70
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,625
That Aleksander Tiedemann
took his wife's name?

71
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,791
No.

72
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,041
Shall we go?

73
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,458
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

74
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,583
Hey, where have you been?

75
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,958
Why didn't you call me back?
I was trying to reach you the whole time.

76
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Last year,
I know where you got the money.

77
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,041
Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.
Kinky stuff costs extra?

78
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,833
Who did you do it with, huh?
Who did you blow in this damn shithole?

79
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,958
Nothing has changed.
Everyone lies. Everyone cheats.

80
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,333
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-I followed you.

81
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,291
I know who you get your money from.

82
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,500
Your first thought
is that I prostitute myself?

83
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,125
What else?

84
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,541
I don't sell my tits or my ass!

85
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,875
I sell hormone therapy prescriptions,
you idiot!

86
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,291
My father used to use them
to pay for his visits.

87
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,125
He stopped going,
and now I'm the new supplier.

88
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,708
Why do you do it?

89
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,500
I help her, she helps me.
It's that simple.

90
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:41,375
The secrets aren't the problem,
it's the shit we all project onto others.

91
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,375
I said it's none of your fucking business,
and it isn't!

92
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,125
I can't believe you spied on me.
How messed up are you?

93
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,333
What's that?

94
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,041
A time machine.

95
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,375
This machine takes you 33 years
into the past

96
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,291
and 33 years into the future.

97
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,291
You're serious?

98
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,083
I did it all wrong.

99
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,416
I tried to keep a secret.

100
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,625
The truth is,
that is exactly what's destroying us.

101
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,708
The secrets.

102
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,708
Mom, I know that sounds insane.

103
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,500
That's why I want you to see for yourself.

104
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,041
With your own eyes.

105
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,791
What do you mean?

106
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,458
Dad's secret.

107
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,250
Out of the way, dork!

108
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,791
Hannah, come on!

109
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,458
What are you staring at?

110
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,916
Thank God you're here.
Someone's waiting for you in your office.

111
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,250
I didn't know.

112
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,708
About the dog.

113
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,125
She says it's hers.

114
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,416
Is that your dog?

115
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,416
I'm so sorry.

116
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,875
She ran up to me.

117
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,875
We called the shelter,
but no one had reported her missing.

118
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,375
-And she resembles the dog I had as a kid.
-Gretchen.

119
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,000
How do you know that?

120
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,375
Because it's my dog.

121
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,166
Just like it's yours.

122
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,333
Excuse me?

123
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,375
And the blood test results?

124
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,166
So it has already spread.

125
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,125
To the hospital?

126
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,583
This Friday?

127
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,458
No.

128
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,833
Yes, that should work.

129
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,333
Don't worry. I have someone.

130
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,541
Yes.

Why not through the forest?

00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,333
I know it's hard to believe.

136
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,416
But I remember.

137
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,125
What?

138
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
This precise moment.

139
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,375
Go to the blinds.

140
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,125
Trust me.

141
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,000
Two people are sitting at their desks,
Hermann and Kowaltschik.

142
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,916
Our secretary will approach
the desk on the right in a moment.

143
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,083
She'll fan her face on the way.

144
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,541
Watch Kowaltschik.

145
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
He's about to drop his pen.

146
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,916
How did you do that?

147
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
I experienced it all.

148
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,625
Everything you've ever experienced
and everything you ever will.

149
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,750
I am you.

150
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,416
And I was told by me
that you and I are the same person.

151
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,333
That's impossible.

152
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,875
This is Gretchen.

153
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,750
The day she ran into the cave
I was there waiting for her.

154
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,125
She recognized me at once,
as if I hadn't aged a second.

155
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,750
I brought her to the other side
so you would find her.

156
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,708
Some things have to happen
as they always have.

157
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,375
The cave.

158
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,333
The incident last summer.

159
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,166
Something else happened afterall!

160
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,083
Do you believe in ghosts?

161
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,666
What do you mean?

162
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,416
The book we're reading at school.

163
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,041
It's about the ghosts and demons

164
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,666
that we inherit from our parents.

165
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,000
And...

166
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,875
that you pass them on.

167
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,958
Dark stuff.

168
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,250
From generation to generation.

169
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,625
Maybe.

170
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,458
But you sure inherited
your mother's best features.

171
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,750
I didn't even know she had any.

172
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,833
No?

173
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,666
You have no idea.

174
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,625
She... She's never around.

175
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,625
And when she is,
all she does is gripe about me.

176
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,666
She has never once said
"I love you" to me.

177
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,000
I love you.

178
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,000
How would you describe
your relationship with Ulrich Nielsen?

179
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,291
I think it's known that we have
no relationship with the Nielsens.

180
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,750
Yet he showed up at your hotel
the day before he disappeared.

181
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,375
What did he want?

182
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,708
He wanted to know
what really happened in 1986.

183
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,666
Because I was the last one...

184
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,916
to see his brother alive.

185
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,625
Your husband.

186
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,541
How long has he lived in Winden?

187
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,250
Since 1986. Why do you ask?

188
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,583
Why did he take your last name?

189
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,041
What does one have to do with the other?

190
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,291
If we're done--

191
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,625
There's still something.

192
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,000
Isn't there?

193
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,541
Last year, a stranger came to the hotel.

194
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,291
Those are his things.

195
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,833
He wanted a room.

196
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,791
He looked like a homeless person.

197
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,500
He paid cash.

198
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,250
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

199
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,125
He left after a few days,
but he wanted to keep the room.

200
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,750
He never came back.

201
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,041
These were all over his walls.

202
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:17,291
As he was leaving, he asked me
to mail a package for him.

203
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,083
To whom?

204
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,208
Jonas Kahnwald.

205
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,791
Why did you not report this?

206
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,708
I have to go. Elisabeth has a swim class.
I totally forgot.

207
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:46,416
Sorry. You can take a taxi.

208
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,291
Well...

209
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,375
This stranger,

210
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,000
what did he look like?

211
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,458
What is this?

212
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,125
What are we doing here?

213
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,541
It's safer to travel from here.

214
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:20,375
I told you it would be easier
to understand once you've seen it.

215
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,208
Don't be scared.

216
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,750
Shouldn't you be at school?

217
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,208
I know you.

218
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,958
You were in the hospital.

219
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,833
I like coming here.

220
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,375
Special place.

221
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,375
So...

222
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,583
Why aren't you at school?

223
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,708
I see.

224
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,000
Sometimes we don't really know
where we're supposed to be.

225
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,125
But I wouldn't go in there.

226
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,833
It's like a maze in there.

227
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,708
Some have never returned.

228
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,958
In the hospital,

229
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,916
you said something.

230
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:52,000
The thing about God,
and that he has a plan for everyone.

231
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,708
But what if God
has no idea what he's doing?

232
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,333
If the plan is wrong? If God is mistaken?

233
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,791
God doesn't make mistakes.

234
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:10,583
Sometimes we have to have more faith
that everything will be okay again.

235
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,875
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

236
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,125
To come by.

237
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:42,875
Now that I'm retired, I have time.

238
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,750
I...

239
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,291
Mads' disappearance.

240
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,375
I can't stop thinking about it.

241
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,208
On that day...

242
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,208
you had a shift
at the nuclear power plant.

243
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,625
You said you took the country road home,
but that's a detour.

244
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,291
Why didn't you take the forest road?

245
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:27,000
He... He said...

246
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,333
he can change everything.

247
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:33,416
He can change the past, and the future.

248
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,583
Who said that?

249
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,166
The man with the stone.

250
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:43,166
But that was 30 years ago.
What does that have to do with Mads?

251
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,333
But no one can change it. No one.

252
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,041
Not even the White Devil.

253
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,833
The White Devil?

254
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:56,375
You've said that before.
Back then, as a child.

255
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,875
Tick, tock.

256
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,791
Tick, tock.

257
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,083
Tick, tock...

258
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:15,041
I'd like you to trust in an idea
that's bigger than you.

259
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,166
Bigger than any of us.

260
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,708
What's that?

261
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,375
This is humankind's greatest discovery.

262
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,208
And also its doom.

263
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,333
It allows you to travel through time.

264
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,833
Thirty three years back.

265
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,208
Thirty three years forward.

266
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,916
And it will take exactly 33 years
for the cycle to be completed again.

267
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,125
Until you are standing
where I am standing now

268
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,083
and accept your role
in this never-ending dance,

269
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,875
and every sacrifice it requires.

270
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,250
In five days, everything will start over.

271
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,166
You must stop Adam.

272
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,291
Who is Adam?

273
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,916
You don't understand it yet.

274
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,750
But you soon will.

275
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,875
Until then, everything will happen
as it always has.

276
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,625
As it must.

277
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:34,833
In the end, life is just a collection
of missed opportunities.

278
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:39,250
You don't have much more time with Regina.

279
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,208
But if everything works out...

280
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,166
she will live.

281
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,625
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME
H.G. TANNHAUS

282
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,291
Charlotte?

283
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,750
Charlotte?

284
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,250
-Is everything okay?
-Last year when the children disappeared,

285
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,666
a man was in Regina's hotel.

286
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,958
He had drawings with him.

287
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,333
Copies.

288
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,708
What kind of drawings?

289
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,916
They're from the book!

290
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,250
The book my grandfather wrote.
A Journey Through Time.

291
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,583
-Everyone always said he was nuts.
-Where are you?

292
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,166
But he knew that it was all true!

293
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,291
Why did he have that photo?

294
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:54,333
Why did he never tell me
who my parents really were?

295
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:21,791
You know the rules.

296
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,916
Do you think they don't apply to you?

297
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,208
Why are you lying to them?

298
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,250
Why don't you tell them
what's really in the dead zone?

299
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,791
In five days, in my time,
everybody is going to die.

300
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,958
I have to stop that.

301
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,625
There is no prophecy!

302
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,625
The passage will never open.

303
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,000
Your paradise does not exist!

304
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:04,875
But behind that wall--

305
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,416
WINDEN BOY MISSING

306
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,125
Hello? Egon here.

307
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,583
Yes.

308
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,416
MISSING PERSON REPORT:
MADS NIELSEN

309
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,333
Listen, in 1953 we arrested a man.

310
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,000
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

311
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,458
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
AFTER 1953?

312
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,458
He killed two kids back then.
Then he abducted Helge Doppler.

313
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,000
NO RESULT

314
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,291
I wanted to know what became of him.

315
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,708
Yes, I'll hold.

316
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:11,875
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

317
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,375
Yes.

318
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,416
Okay, that's the case.

319
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,833
What? He's still here?

320
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,666
Where?

321
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,583
-Yes?
-Chief Inspector Tiedemann.

322
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,541
I'd like to speak to a patient.

323
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,583
Weren't you notified I was coming?

324
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,125
Not that I know of.

325
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,750
Well...

326
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,833
File number...

327
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,208
K53.

328
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,291
He must have been here for 34 years now.

329
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,666
The Inspector?

330
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,708
We call him that here.

331
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,750
Nice guy. He's been here longer
than most of the staff.

332
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,875
Practically part of the furniture.

333
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,250
-He'll be glad to have a visitor.
-Does he...

334
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,916
Does he get day-release?

335
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,375
No, he's in the closed ward.

336
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,583
The guy over there,
with the long gray hair.

337
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,666
Thanks.

338
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,333
Excuse me, please.

339
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,375
You may not remember me anymore.

340
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,583
My name is Egon Tiedemann.

341
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,166
I arrested you 34 years ago.

342
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,708
Egon Tiedemann.

343
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,333
How could I ever forget you?

344
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,291
I...

345
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,875
I wanted...

346
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,458
I have a few questions.

347
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:15,000
My only aim is to take many lives.
The more the better I feel.

348
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,041
I know that.

349
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,125
You've said that before.

350
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,125
What does it mean?

351
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:29,041
It means that you, you moron,
still haven't understood a thing.

352
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:35,166
But now you have to hurry.
You don't have much time left.

353
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,833
I know when you die.

354
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,375
It was in the paper.

355
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,208
I don't understand.

356
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,750
No, of course you don't.

357
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,416
But maybe that is also your fate.

358
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,833
To die as clueless as you were
when you were born.

359
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,500
Everyone gets what they deserve.

360
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,666
Where have you been?

361
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,916
I was so worried.

362
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,166
I called the school.
They said you never showed up there.

363
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,791
Did something happen?

364
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,208
You know what?

365
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,916
There are days it's best to just forget.

366
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,541
But...

367
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:05,000
there's no better comfort food
than "Toast Hawaii."

368
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,833
We always had it at home
when I was little,

369
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,750
with two maraschino cherries.

370
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,416
And my dad used to dance,

371
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,833
like Elvis.

372
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,833
PINEAPPLES

373
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,708
Do you believe in God?

374
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,541
Do you believe he has a plan for us?

375
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,708
I believe... he does.

376
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:42,250
I believe, for example, that God saw to it

377
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,125
that you came to me.

378
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,375
And that his plan for me is

379
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,208
to be there for you.

380
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,750
Right, let's make "Toast Hawaii," okay?

381
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,083
Will you help me?

382
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,000
Why didn't she kill you?

383
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,125
Who are you really?

384
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,291
Who are you?

385
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,625
I want you to show me.

386
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,458
What's really in the dead zone.

387
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,333
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

388
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,958
BUILDING YOUR FAMILY'S HAPPINESS

389
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,250
What is that?

390
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,791
She said it's a portal.

391
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,583
Who?

392
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,625
I have tapes
with a woman speaking on them.

393
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,041
Her name is Claudia Tiedemann.

394
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:51,875
I know none of this makes sense,
but that may be the only way back home.

395
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,833
No clue if it works.

396
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,166
You want to go in?

397
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,250
It doesn't matter
if I die inside it or out here.

398
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,041
Jonas!

399
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:34,791
