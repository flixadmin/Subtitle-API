1
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Look at me. Look at me!

2
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,880
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,380
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

4
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,140
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

5
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,740
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

6
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,580
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

7
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,540
Do you want to live, boy?!

8
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,460
North, boy, we're going north.

9
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,330
It had three eyes.

10
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,410
It told me to come with him, so I did.

11
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,670
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

12
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,630
Your father's not down there, little lord.

13
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,590
Not for many years yet.

14
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,220
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

15
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,470
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

16
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

17
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,110
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.

18
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,070
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

19
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,990
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

20
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,540
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

21
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,620
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

22
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
Robert started a war to win her back.

23
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,210
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

24
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,760
That's where I saw Father.

25
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,680
You see? He's not here.

26
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,400
Here, Shaggydog.
Rickon!

27
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,690
That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

28
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,990
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

29
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,410
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.

30
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,080
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

31
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,580
He was down here. I saw him.

32
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,380
Saw him when?

33
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,670
Last night, when I was sleeping.

34
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,340
Here, Shaggydog.

35
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,560
You both miss him.

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,190
It's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,

37
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,230
but that doesn't mean that...

38
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,940
Bran...

39
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,550
- My lady.
- My lady.

40
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,920
My lady.

41
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,720
- My lady.
- My lady.

42
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,300
My lady.

43
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,440
Robb.

44
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,440
Robb!

45
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,700
You've ruined your sword.

46
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,510
Shh! Shh!

47
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,670
- Shh!
- I'll kill them all.

48
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,680
- Every one of them.
- Shh.

49
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,310
I will kill them all.

50
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,890
My boy.

51
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
They have your sisters.

52
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,610
We have to get the girls back.

53
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,320
And then we will kill them all.

54
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,420

Isn't it a funny song?

68
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,110
Thank you for your rendition.

69
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,780
I imagine it was even better received
at that tavern.

70
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,950
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.

71
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

72
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,490
Tell me, which do you favor -

73
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,450
your fingers or your tongue?

74
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,790
Your Grace?

75
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,460
Fingers or your tongue?

76
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,250
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

77
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,760
Or I could just cut your throat.

78
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,590
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,430
Good.

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,220
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

81
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,270
I won't sing, Your Grace.

82
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,480
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

83
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,020
I beg you! Please, no.

84
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,440
No!

85
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,660
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

86
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,700
- I'm done for the day.
- No!

87
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,250
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

88
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,920
Your Grace, please!

89
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,720
You look quite nice.

90
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,680
- Thank you, my lord.
- "Your Grace. " I'm King now.

91
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,980
Stop! No!

92
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,190
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

93
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,820
Do as you're bid, child.

94
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,700
...and as soon as you've had your blood,
I'll put a son in you.

95
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,870
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

96
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,130
No! Please, no!

97
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,960
This one's your father.

98
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,340
This one here.

99
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,720
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

100
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,720
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

101
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,930
I gave him a clean death.

102
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,900
Look at him.

103
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,110
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear...

104
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,200
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here... and obey.

105
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,620
Look at him!

106
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,960
Well?

107
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,050
How long do I have to look?

108
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,050
As long as it pleases me.

109
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,220
Do you want to see the rest?

110
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,680
If it please Your Grace.

111
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,770
That's your Septa there.

112
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,520
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to give you a present.

113
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,280
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

114
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm going to give you his head as well.

115
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,490
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

116
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,420
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

117
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,090
Ser Meryn.

118
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,940
Here, girl.

119
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,530
Will you obey now?

120
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,410
Or do you need another lesson?

121
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll look for you in court.

122
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,840
Save yourself some pain, girl.

123
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,800
Give him what he wants.

124
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,550
You'll be needing that again.

125
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,990
The proper course is clear -

126
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,790
pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.

127
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,040
Renly is not the king.

128
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,630
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

129
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,500
He put your father to death.

130
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,500
That doesn't make Renly king.

131
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,300
He's Robert's youngest brother.

132
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,390
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

133
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,510
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

134
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,230
- Renly is not right!
- My lords.

135
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,230
- If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lords!

136
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,520
Here is what I say to these two kings.

137
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,900
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

138
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,410
nor Stannis neither.

139
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,330
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some flowery seat in the South?

140
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,290
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

141
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,380
Even their gods are wrong!

142
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,630
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

143
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,840
It was the dragons we bowed to...

144
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,930
and now the dragons are dead!

145
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,690
There sits the only king
I mean to bend my knee to -

146
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,940
the King in the North!

147
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,450
I'll have peace on those terms.

148
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,120
They can keep their Red Castle

149
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,040
and their iron chair too.

150
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,000
The King in the North!

151
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,960
Am I your brother, now and always?

152
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,550
Now and always.

153
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,180
My sword is yours...

154
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,310
in victory and defeat,
from this day until my last day.

155
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,140
The King in the North!

156
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,070
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

157
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,150
The King in the North!

158
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,820
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

159
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,490
The King in the North!

160
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,580
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

161
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,540
The King in the North!

162
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,620
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

163
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,380
The King in the North!

164
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,300
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

165
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,970
Now!

166
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,410
Leave us.

167
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,710
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

168
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,540
Widowhood becomes you.

169
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,380
Your bed must be lonely.

170
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,300
Is that why you came?

171
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm not at my best,
but I think I could be of service.

172
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,930
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

173
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

174
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,400
I will kill you tonight, ser...

175
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,240
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

176
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,740
Let me show you how...

177
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,290
Hit me again, over the ear.

178
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,420
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

179
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,130
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

180
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,460
But I don't, my lady.

181
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,760
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

182
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,470
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

183
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,720
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

184
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,890
The trees your husband prayed to?

185
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,190
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped off?

186
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,070
If your gods are real and if they are just...

187
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,320
why is the world so full of injustice?

188
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,620
Because of men like you.

189
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,120
There are no men like me.

190
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,250
Only me.

191
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,750
My son Bran.

192
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,300
How did he come to fall from that tower?

193
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,930
I pushed him out the window.

194
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,890
Why?

195
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,440
I... hoped the fall would kill him.

196
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,940
Why?

197
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,320
You should get some sleep.

198
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,660
It's going to be a long war.

199
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,980
I can't believe we're actually at war.

200
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,320
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

201
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,150
What does it say?

202
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,820
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

203
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,200
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

204
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,370
Get back into bed.

205
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,340
They have my son.

206
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,260
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

207
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,640
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

208
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,350
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

209
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,150
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

210
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,730
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

211
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,650
It's a catastrophe.

212
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,650
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

213
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,870
There's your peace.

214
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,620
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

215
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,920
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

216
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

217
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,500
He's winning...

218
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,800
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- I'm told we still have his sisters.

219
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,260
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

220
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,600
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

221
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,980
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

222
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,480
They have my son!

223
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,190
Get out, all of you.

224
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,910
Not you.

225
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,640
You were right about Eddard Stark.

226
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,730
If he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

227
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,280
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

228
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,280
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

229
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,330
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

230
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,160
Perhaps I was wrong.

231
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,920
Half wrong.

232
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm new to strategy, but...

233
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,010
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

234
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,800
No one will stay here.

235
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,550
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

236
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,730
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

237
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,850
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

238
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,270
And you will go to King's Landing.

239
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,740
- And do what?
- Rule.

240
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,030
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

241
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,370
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

242
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,080
And if you get so much as a whiff of treason
from any of the rest -

243
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,210
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

244
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,710
Why not my uncle?

245
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,010
Why not anyone? Why me?

246
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,470
You're my son.

247
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,230
Oh, one more thing.

248
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,610
You will not take that whore to court.

249
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,440
Do you understand?

250
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,710
Ser Jorah?

251
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,890
Gently, gently.

252
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,390
My son...

253
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,850
Where is he? I want him.

254
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,270
Where is he?

255
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,570
The boy did not live.

256
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,490
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

257
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,830
How did my son die?

258
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,420
He never lived, my princess.

259
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,000
The women say...

260
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,250
What do the women say?

261
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,850
- They say the child was...
- Monstrous, twisted.

262
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,850
I pulled him out myself.

263
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,980
He was scaled like a lizard,

264
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,310
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

265
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,480
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

266
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,360
Inside... he was full of graveworms.

267
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,330
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

268
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,330
You knew the price.

269
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,330
Where is Khal Drogo?

270
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,500
Show him to me.

271
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,010
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

272
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,090
As you command, lady.

273
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,640
Come. I will take you to him.

274
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,560
- Time enough for that later...
- I want to see him now.

275
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,530
The khalasar is gone.

276
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,370
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

277
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,120
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

278
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,130
I'm sorry, my Princess.

279
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,350
Drogo!

280
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,770
My sun and stars.

281
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,560
Why is he out here alone?

282
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,520
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

283
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,570
He lives.

284
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
You asked for life, you paid for life.

285
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,990
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

286
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,160
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

287
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,210
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

288
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Leave us.

289
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,770
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

290
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,070
I have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

291
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,150
Go.

292
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,250
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

293
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

294
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,590
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

295
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,670
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

296
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,760
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

297
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,050
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

298
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,600
I spoke for you.

299
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,770
- I saved you.
- Saved me?

300
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,520
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

301
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,990
I saw my god's house burn,

302
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,620
there where I had healed men and women
beyond counting.

303
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,040
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

304
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,500
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

305
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,920
the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.

306
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,220
So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

307
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,260
Your life.

308
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,810
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

309
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,520
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

310
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,310
when all the rest has gone.

311
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
You can't!

312
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,540
Get out of my way, Sam.

313
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,540
They'll put out the word.

314
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,210
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

315
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,170
Do you know what happens to deserters?

316
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,340
Better than you do.

317
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,970
What are you going to do?

318
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,020
I'm gonna find my brother

319
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,930
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

320
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,520
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

321
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,360
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

322
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,200
- Move.
- No.

323
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,780
Hyah!

324
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,590
Hand of the King?

325
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,800
So it would seem.

326
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,310
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

327
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,060
No, he said I couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

328
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,980
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

329
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,690
What?

330
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,400
He said,
"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

331
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,360
I believe he used the word "whore".

332
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,490
Are you ashamed of me?

333
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,740
Are you afraid that I'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

334
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm funny now?

335
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,960
I'm Shae, the funny whore.

336
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,210
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

337
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,800
Certainly the richest.

338
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,340
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

339
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,350
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

340
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,770
He's always been a cunt.

341
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,150
I believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

342
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,990
from a girl like you.

343
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,330
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

344
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,040
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

345
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,040
I know what a Hand needs.

346
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,890
Ghost?

347
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,100
Hyah!

348
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,560
Hyah! Hyah!

349
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,030
Hyah!

350
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,030
Samwell!

351
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,040
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

352
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,700
Did we get him?

353
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,660
Come on, help me get him up.

354
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,170
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

355
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,220
We're taking you back to where you belong.

356
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,890
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

357
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,800
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

358
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,220
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

359
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,390
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

360
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,100
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

361
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,560
You took the oath. You can't leave.

362
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,690
- I have to.
- You can't.

363
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,150
- You said the words.
- I don't care about...

364
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,410
"Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow... "

365
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,740
- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.

366
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,000
"It shall not end until my death.

367
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,080
"I shall live and die at my post. "

368
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,880
"I am the sword in the darkness... "

369
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,790
"The watcher on the walls... "

370
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,550
"The shield that guards the realms of men.

371
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,300
"I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

372
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,100
"for this night and all nights to come. "

373
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,010
Do you remember
our first ride, my sun and stars?

374
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,730
If you are in there, if you haven't gone away,
show me.

375
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,160
You're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.

376
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,620
I need you to fight now.

377
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,670
I know you're very far away,

378
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,590
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

379
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,290
When the sun...

380
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,910
rises in the west...

381
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,370
...and sets in the east...

382
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,050
...then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

383
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,950
Kings?

384
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,790
Oh, I can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

385
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,920
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

386
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,640
For the past 67 years, I've known...

387
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,600
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

388
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,690
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

389
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,730
Yes.

390
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,280
And keep on serving them.

391
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,780
Aerys Targaryen.

392
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,200
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

393
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,460
madness is the worst.

394
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,500
He was a good man.

395
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,630
Such a charmer.

396
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,380
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

397
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,810
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

398
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,560
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

399
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,400
powerful man, great warrior -

400
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,490
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

401
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,820
are rather different things.

402
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,450
They say that...

403
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,040
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

404
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,500
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side.

405
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,170
Now I serve his son...

406
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,630
King Joffrey...

407
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
may the gods bless his reign.

408
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,680
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

409
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,850
Stern.

410
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,310
But sternness in defense of the realm
is no vice.

411
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,320
It's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

412
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,490
I sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

413
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,200
Mmm.

414
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,620
True greatness.

415
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,880
So what's the thing?

416
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,340
What thing?

417
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,220
About kings.

418
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,100
You said, "The thing you
need to understand about kings... "

419
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,100
What? Things? What?

420
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,310
When you started, you...
Never mind.

421
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,860
Let me see you out, my dear.

422
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,940
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

423
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,110
Till the next time.

424
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,220
Right.

425
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,870
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

426
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,250
Does the crown fit?

427
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,630
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

428
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,710
the ones who sneered at you for years?

429
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,130
It's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

430
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
A man with great ambition and no morals -

431
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,470
I wouldn't bet against you.

432
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,520
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

433
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,020
I must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

434
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,690
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

435
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,360
Oh, you can do better than that.

436
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,330
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

437
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,250
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

438
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,580
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

439
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,800
I picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

440
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,760
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

441
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,680
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

442
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,600
a man from another land,

443
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,020
despised by most,

444
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,350
feared by all...

445
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,060
Am I? That is good to know.

446
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,520
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

447
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,730
But you carry on...

448
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,900
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

449
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,950
I admire you.

450
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,290
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

451
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,870
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

452
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

453
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,300
So...

454
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,470
here we stand...

455
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,100
in mutual admiration and respect.

456
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,180
Playing our roles.

457
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,640
Serving a new king.

458
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,100
Long may he reign.

459
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,310
- My king.
- My king.

460
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,770
My lords. Shall we begin?

461
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,690
You're Arry now, hear me?

462
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,780
Arry the orphan boy.

463
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,490
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

464
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,450
What's your name?

465
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,790
Arry.

466
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,460
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

467
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,750
I've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

468
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,170
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

469
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,510
and I didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

470
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,970
This lot -

471
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,970
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

472
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,150
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

473
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,780
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

474
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,490
You stay with this lot, boy.

475
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,160
And stay...

476
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,950
or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

477
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,290
Watch yourself, midget.

478
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,040
He's got a sword, this one.

479
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,670
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

480
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,760
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

481
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,430
He looks like a girl.

482
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,640
I bet he stole that sword.

483
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,140
Let's have a look.

484
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,640
I could use me a sword like that.

485
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,150
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

486
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,020
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

487
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,940
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

488
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,280
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

489
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,610
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

490
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,530
I kicked him all to pieces.

491
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,200
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

492
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,960
I'll give it to you.

493
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,710
I already killed one fat boy.

494
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,250
I bet you never killed anyone.

495
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,090
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

496
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,050
I'm good at killing fat boys.

497
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,800
I like killing fat boys.

498
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,970
Like picking on the little ones, do you?

499
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,810
I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

500
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,310
When I hit that steel, it sings.

501
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,190
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

502
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,030
This is castle-forged steel.

503
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,280
Where'd you steal it?

504
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,080
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

505
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,580
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

506
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,040
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

507
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,580
murderers.

508
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,050
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

509
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,180
But my master got sick of me, so...
here I am.

510
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,470
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

511
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,810
It's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

512
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,390
And winter is coming!

513
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,180
Ham.

514
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,140
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

515
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,020
Bring me some beer at least.

516
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,060
You look exhausted.

517
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,190
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

518
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,780
Don't look so terrified.

519
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,530
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

520
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,330
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

521
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,790
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

522
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,580
Honor made you leave,

523
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,380
honor brought you back.

524
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,380
My friends brought me back.

525
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,470
I didn't say it was your honor.

526
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,220
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

527
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,510
No? Good.

528
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,310
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

529
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,110
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

530
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,280
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

531
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,530
from dusk until dawn.

532
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,120
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

533
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,790
to what ends the gods only know.

534
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,160
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

535
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,540
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

536
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,750
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

537
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,430
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

538
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,810
No.

539
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,730
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

540
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,730
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

541
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,900
- No.
- Good.

542
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,650
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

543
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,660
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

544
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,370
Beyond the Wall?

545
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,540
I'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

546
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,540
I mean to find out what's happening.

547
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,590
The Night's Watch will ride in force

548
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,920
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

549
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,260
And we will find Benjen Stark,

550
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,970
alive or dead.

551
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,100
I will command them myself.

552
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,810
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

553
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,730
Move out!

554
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,440
...are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

555
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,150
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

556
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,940
Is this your command, Khaleesi?

557
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,450
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

558
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,660
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

559
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,830
They were not given to me to sell.

560
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,420
Khaleesi, my Queen...

561
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,050
I vow to serve you, obey you,

562
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,050
to die for you if need be...

563
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,430
but let him go, Khaleesi.

564
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,730
I know what you intend. Do not.

565
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,520
I must.

566
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,770
You don't understand...

567
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,820
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

568
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,700
I won't watch you burn.

569
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,370
Is that what you fear?

570
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,850
You will be my khalasar.

571
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,060
I see the faces of slaves.

572
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,560
I free you.

573
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,610
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

574
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,280
But if you stay...

575
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,860
it will be as brothers and sisters,

576
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,280
as husbands and wives.

577
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,460
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

578
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,050
You swore to obey me.

579
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,020
I am Daenerys Stormborn...

580
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,940
of House Targaryen...

581
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,940
of the blood of old Valyria.

582
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,820
I am the Dragon's Daughter.

583
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,280
And I swear to you...

584
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,120
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

585
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,910
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

586
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,750
But it is not your screams I want.

587
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,840
Only your life.

588
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,200
Blood of my blood.
