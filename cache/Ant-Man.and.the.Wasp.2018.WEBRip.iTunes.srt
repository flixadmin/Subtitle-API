be down there.

It's called a hypothesis.

when you were down there,

you may have entangled
with her.

triggered it.

809
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,159
You almost got it.

how was school today?

(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

816
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,750
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

817
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,377
So cranky.

818
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,129
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

819

-(CHUCKLES)
-Do you really have that?

820

00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,449
This has gotta be the lab.

826
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,413
Let's go get it.

827
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:55,747
Yeah.

828
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,508
This seems right.

829
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,888
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

830
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,514
Makes you think, huh?

831
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,724
About what?

832
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,517
Germany.

833
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:16,602
What do you mean?

834
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,438
We were working together,
training together...

835
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:22,065
and other stuffing together.

836
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,568
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

837
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,278
I guess we'll never know.

838
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,988
But I do know one thing.

839
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,072
What?

840
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,992
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

Hey, Scott.

842
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,587
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

843
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,172
long enough to get my lab?

-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

up with a name for my ant.

HANK: I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.

852
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,529
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

Be careful.

854
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,323
ANT-MAN: You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

855
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,201
THE WASP: It's okay.
It's just the suit.

856
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:15,953
ANT-MAN: How do you know?
THE WASP: Look.

857
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:20,916
ANT-MAN: That's Ghost?

858
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,376
THE WASP: What is she doing?

859
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:23,627
ANT-MAN: Do you think
that suit is how

860
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,504
she goes through walls
and stuff?

861
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,548
THE WASP: Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

ANT-MAN: (WHISPERS) Hope,
look! There's the lab.

863

Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

864
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,600
and not
somebody else's, right?

865
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,894
THE WASP: Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

866
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:43,105

I don't think
they can hear you.

So, you don't need the suit...

to go through things.

No.

878
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,690
It just helps me control it.

879
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:31,945
And the pain, supposedly.

880

You're not gonna reach
into my chest

are you talking about?

is going on here?

ever mentioned my father.

A rather dull name, I think.

AVA: Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.

so I could control my phasing.

953

to be a stealth operative.

That's me. I'm sorry.

974
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,849
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

975
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:13,602
"Cassie, 911."

976
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,687
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

977
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,105
No, that's not happening.

978
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,149
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

979
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,984
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

983
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,867
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

What's the emergency?

00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,123
I can't find my soccer shoes.

987

What?

I have a game tomorrow.

I know that they're there.

00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,254
Can you just walk the phone
around the house?

991
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,797
No, I can't do that right now.

992
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:43,715
-Why not?
-Because I'm sick.

993
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:44,842
MAGGIE: Hey, can you just
maybe look around

994
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:45,926
later then and call me back?

995
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,427

I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:56,770
Ava, I want to help you.

1001
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,939
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

1002
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,315
Oh, really? How?

1003
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:01,483
Janet.

1004
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:03,110
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

1005
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:04,194
absorbing quantum energy.

1006
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,737
We can extract that energy.

1007
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:08,115
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

1008
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,199
Extract it?

1009
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,450
-Yes.
-Are you insane?

1010
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,202
That would rip Janet apart.

1011
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,205
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

1012
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,582
When Janet's location

1013
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:17,958
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

1014
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,793
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

BILL: You are gonna
stay here...

1017
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,965
just in case I need your help.

1018
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:27,301

about yourself, Hank.

He needs his pills.

Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

He stole my plans.

1042
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,109
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

1044

Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

1045

Good job.

1046
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,284
It'll work.

the entire system.

1048

Look, we'll adjust the relays

1049
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,665
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

1050

Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

1053
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,094
to prepare I'd be more ready.

1054
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:55,180
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

1055
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,724
It kind of melts your mind.

1056

What if she's a completely
different person?

00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,526
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

I'm serious, Scott.

What if she's forgotten
about me?

from a friend of mine...

00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:03,684
at the FBI that you are

of Scott Lang...

where it is.

Well, what is it then?

Well, see, that's complicated.

when you're on lockup?"

"and we're gonna be

and he starts working
for Hank.

That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...

"I want nothing to do
with you.

"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."

00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:49,952

"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"

and they're all
into each other, right?

1222

-Can you knock?

1282
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:55,118
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1283
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,247
Ooh, I love leads.

1284
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,046
System's in the green.

1287

As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1288
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,595
let us know
if you get anything

1289
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:14,680
that could be a part of
her message.

1290
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:16,181
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1291

1292
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:23,480

(CHUCKLES)

1294
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:38,954
We did it!

1295
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:40,998
You got anything?

1296
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,127
Nothin'.

1297
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,005
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1298
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:50,674
No.

1299
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:52,384
No, no, no, no!

1300
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:53,468
What's happening?

1301
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,345
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1302
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,806
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1303
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,891
HOPE: Then what else
could it be?

1304
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,851
-HANK: I don't know!
-(ALARM BEEPING)

-Scott, get away from that!

1306

Scott, you can't...

1307
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,153
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1308
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,529
I need to fix the algorithm.

1309
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,075
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1310
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,911
I've thought about it a lot.

1311
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,416
Janet?

1312
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:28,670
Hi, honey.

1313
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:33,592
Jellybean.

1314
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:35,385
Mom?

1315
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,013
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1316
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,932
It's all so rushed.

1317
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,392
You two have done
such great work.

1318
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,520
You just need a little...

1319
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,230
nudge.

1320
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,956
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1321
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,917
It wasn't a message you put

1322
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,335
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1323
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,045
Clever girl.

1324
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:12,548
-I'm so proud of you.
-(CHUCKLES)

1325
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,424
Honey, tell us where you are.

1326
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:16,176
Tell us how to find you.

1327
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,178
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1328
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:19,680
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1329
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,265
You have to follow my voice.

1330
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:22,766
Of course!

1331
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,810
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1332
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,901
HANK: I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1333
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,320
between point two
and point nine.

1334
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,030
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1335
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:38,323
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1336
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,075
Look at us squabbling again.

1337
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,662
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1338
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:47,207
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1339
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,209
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:06,768
It's you.

1343
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:08,979
HOPE: (LAUGHS) We got it!

1344
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:11,690
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1345
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:14,359
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1346
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:15,694
It's very dangerous,

1347
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:17,821
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1348
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,532
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1349
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,075
You have two hours.

1350
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:23,911
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1351
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:25,037
and it'll be another century

1352
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,580
before they align
like this again.

1353
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,749
HOPE: We'll find you.

1354
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,591
I know you will, Jellybean.

1355
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,639
Nope.

1356
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:45,641
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1357

Perfect.

1358

How did we get up here?

1359
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,902
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1360
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,195
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1361
01:02:58,362 --> 01:03:01,073
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1362
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,699
Scott, I'll be fine.

1363
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,368
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1364
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,869
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

some truth serum.

1373
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,553
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1374

that you load the dishwasher.

To shrink that wall.

1524

It looks load-bearing.

1525
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:22,806
The ceiling could collapse.

Then we run like hell.

Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

Roughly five times that

the lab?

After we lost it
the first time...

1565
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:18,172
I put on a new tracker...

of sorts.

1582
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:32,704
So, we should do that.

1583
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:34,998
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1584
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:37,626
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1585
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,920
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1586
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:42,506
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1587
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:44,216
Let's call it 2-A.

1588

Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1589
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,386
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1590
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,720
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1591
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:49,805
Otherwise, we're screwed.

You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1594
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:53,809
I'm going to dive.

1595
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,688
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

together,
protecting the tunnel.

1597

Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1598
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,531
Let me get her.

I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

Now, I got this.

a smaller quantum tunnel.

Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.
