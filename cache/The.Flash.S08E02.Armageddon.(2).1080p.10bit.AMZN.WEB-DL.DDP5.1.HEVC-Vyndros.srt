any less.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,770

the future.

8

I now know the force required

9

when the time comes.

10
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,038

your destiny, Flash.

12

I've watched you use your power

13
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:44,305
to destroy everything
and everyone.

14
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,873

why I would do this.

15

Huh?

16

17

19
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,098
- Madness.

20
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,363
Many times in the past,

21
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,366
the pain you've suffered
nearly crushed you.

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,717
But soon, a new despair
will befall you.

23
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,285
And it will create
an unbroken chain of sorrow

24
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:10,505
so great...

25
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:12,289
your mind will crack.

26
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,771
And with it, the world ends.

27
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,340
You see...

28
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:22,256
your power has
recently accelerated.

29
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,695
But so too has your ability
to descend into madness.

30

Tragedy is coming for you,
Flash.

31
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:32,918
What remains to be seen isn't
whether or not you'll break.

32
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,790
It's when.

33
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,183
- I have seven days.

34
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:38,141

about tomorrow

35

36
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,709

of what will happen.

38
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:45,844
But I know tomorrow is
the beginning of the end.

39
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:48,543
Your end.

40
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:52,373
I've granted you a chance
to defy destiny.

41
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,506
But I'll be staying close by.

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,945
As soon as I sense
your mind turning mad,

43
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,165
I'll find you.

44

Good luck fighting fate, Flash.

I mean, come on,

81
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,107
it's weird that an alien cares
so much about Earth?

82
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,630
He's not even from here.

83

- Wherever he's from,
here's what we know.

84
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,895
I ran a bio-scan on Despero

85
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,723
the minute he entered
S.T.A.R. Labs.

86
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,335
His anatomy is unlike anything
I ever studied before.

87
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,119
He has strength
and invulnerability

88
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:12,121
that rivals Kryptonians.

89
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,298
How are we gonna stop him
from killing you?

90
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,299
- Prove him wrong.

91
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,388
Despero says tomorrow,

92
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,216
my mind starts to break.

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,350
So all we have to do is make it
through the next 24 hours

94
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:26,353
without that happening,

- Let's get some rest.

97
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,402
Tomorrow, we'll need to be
on the lookout for anything,

98
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,448
and if something does happen,

99
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,581
then we need to be ready

100

Lucky us.

828
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,599

829
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:46,427

831
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,476
- Yeah, thanks. You too, Alex.

832
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,738
- Well, we may not be the Tower

833
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,522
or have access
to S.T.A.R. Labs,

834
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,350
but Chester P can still
roll up his sleeves

835
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,267
and see what I can come up with
to help track down Barry.

836
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,922
- Assuming he wants
to be found.

837
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,534
- If you and Allegra hadn't
shown up when you did--

838
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,144
- Hey, hey, it's all good.

839
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:09,885
Okay? We'll figure this out.

840
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,192
We always do.

841
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,715
We'll get Barry back.

842
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,717
- Yeah, but what will he
be like when we do?
