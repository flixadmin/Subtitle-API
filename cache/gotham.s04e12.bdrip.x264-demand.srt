176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,590
Well, it seems like
a piece of a toy plane.

And, yet, if I'm not mistaken,

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,230

and has considerable talent,

Pretty elaborate.

I can think of easier ways

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,750
to kill a room full of criminals
than with a toy plane.

186
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Perhaps, it was intended
to fly to someone specific

187

and not destroy the whole room.

188
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,913

189
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,952
If so, who was the target?

190

needs to be made an example of.

the best thing for The Narrows

is to burn it to the ground! Start over.
