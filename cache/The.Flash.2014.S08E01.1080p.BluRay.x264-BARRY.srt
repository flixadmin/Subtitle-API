1
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,602
<i>Look at them.</i>

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,854
<i>Praying for a miracle
that isn't coming.</i>

3
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,856
Who knows?

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,193
Maybe it's my curse to leave
one betrayal behind,

5
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,821
only to find a greater one
here amongst the stars.

6
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,324
They could've stopped this.

7
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:35,078
But none of them had the strength
to do what must be done.

8
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:37,539
But I do.

9
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,289
So what is it like walking
to go get coffee when you can run

10
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,790
4,000 miles an hour?

11
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,002
It's nice slowing down every once
in a while, even for the Flash.

12
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,211
Is Frost joining us?

13
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,631
No. Last night I sent her on
a two week <i>Eat Pray Love</i> tour

14
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,883
because she's still
pining over Mark Blaine.

15
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,820
I thought
she was mad at him all summer.

16
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:33,844
And fall.

17
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,389
But she still misses him,
even though I told her

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,558
he's a jerk who is
never going to change.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,143
Let me guess, she didn't care?

20
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,477
Yep, she said,

21
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,438
"The heart wants what the heart wants."

22
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,398
She's always been such a romantic.

23
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,407
I have learned one thing
watching Frost go through all this.

24
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,784
For the first time since Ronnie passed,

25
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,705
I think I'm really ready
to get back out there.

26
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,500
I'm... gonna start dating again.

27
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,170
That's awesome.
I'm really happy for you.

28
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:10,131
Thank you. Now if I can just get
some oat milk for my coffee.

29
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,613
Two bullet trains on the Calvert Railway
are going to collide.

30
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,680
Barry, that's 50 miles
south of Keystone City.

31
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:18,764
Yeah.

32
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,578
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
authorities are now confirming</i>

33
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:45,291
<i>that despite a massive explosion
caused by today's railway accident,</i>

34
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,087
<i>no lives were lost
during this horrific event.</i>

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,965
<i>It appears our city
has the Flash to thank once more.</i>

36
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,096
That was amazing!

37
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,057
You got everyone to safety
in what, 20 seconds?

38
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,768
Twelve actually. Try your coffee.

39
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,110
Wow. You have seriously leveled up.

40
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,655
If only you could teach Frost
how to do the same.

41
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:17,657
I mean, bypassing anyone
who calls themselves "Chillblaine,"

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,420
I think would save her
a lot of heartbreak.

43
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:23,121
I mean, Frost dating anybody,
is a first for her, right?

44
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,039
And everybody you dated before Ronnie,

45
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,749
I'm guessing that was you leveling up.

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,334
You know, it's a process.

47
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,546
Maybe just give Frost space
to do the same.

48
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,093
Captain Kramer,
while supportive of your transparency...

49
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,637
...you have been criticized
for your decision

50
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,431
to disband the city's meta task force.

51
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,934
Some people thinking that it will
increase meta-crime across the city.

52
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,436
Do you care to comment?

53
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:53,234
Once I came to terms with being a meta,
it helped me realize how important it is

54
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:58,114
for everyone in Central City to receive
equal protections under the same laws.

55
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:02,326
So you felt as though the meta
task force was unfairly targeting

56
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,328
marginalized sections of the populace.

57
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,039
Yes, which is why its time has passed.

58
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,459
Great. Thank you, Captain Kramer.

59
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,961
This is Iris West-Allen
for <i>Citizentopia.</i>

60
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,254
Thank you for listening.

61
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,757
That was great.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,091
It was great. Come in.

63
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,469
Allegra, you remember Captain Kramer?

64
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,552
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,765
Well, I have an appointment
with Chief Singh,

66
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,141
so, thanks.

67
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,809
You wanted to see me?

68
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,190
Yes. So the last six months
have been pretty intense.

69
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:37,445
I'll say. We have three new reporters,
an IT intern and an office manager now.

70
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,989
Plus, online circulation's
over two million,

71
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,241
and your new podcast's
frickin' brilliant.

72
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,286
- Thank you.
- Oh, we need faster internet.

73
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,704
Should we call the new landlord?

74
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,265
Sue Dearbon bought the building.

75
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,166
I think we can fix our own internet.

76
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,249
Roger that.

77
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,711
But seriously, I just
don't see how you do it all

78
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,439
and still find time
for an op-ed each week.

79
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,672
Well, I can't.

80
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,258
So the bullpen needs
a supervising editor.

81
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,944
Someone who decides
which stories we cover

82
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,387
and then assigns and pre-edits copy.

83
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,475
Which is why I am promoting you.

84
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,268
Wha... Iris...

85
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,688
Well, I've barely been staff for a year.

86
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,148
I'm not ready for that.

87
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,944
- Well, I think you are.
- You do realize you have people on staff

88
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,154
who are more qualified
to handle that sort of thing?

89
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,491
I mean, Vanya, she's got ten years
of experience under her belt.

90
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,992
Or that annoying Taylor,

91
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,120
just graduated summa cum laude
from Barnard College.

92
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,623
Even the old guy was a war correspondent
in Beirut.

93
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,710
Aariz is my age. Girl!

94
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,593
Look, now that we're
CC Citizen Media, I am busier

95
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,345
with more and more
administrative duties.

96
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,014
- Iris, are you sure?
- You got this.

97
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,432
I believe in you.

98
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,022
What is this?

99
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:59,193
A candlelit pizza dinner,
from our favorite place in Milan.

100
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,613
Oh, thank God, I was too tired to cook.

101
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,073
I can't imagine why.

102
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,617
Team Citizen's
been in overdrive these days.

103
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,911
Plus, Deon's still helping to stabilize

104
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,330
your temporal sickness
with regular treatments.

105
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:12,790
It's a lot to handle.

106
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,625
I told you I'm fine.

107
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,712
Plus, you're not exactly
an underachiever yourself, Flash.

108
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,422
Nice work at Calvert Railway.

109
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,421
Thanks.

110
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,823
I guess we both earned a night off.

111
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,050
And without kids, too.

112
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,404
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's great having Bart and Nora

113
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,096
stop in all the time from 2049...

114
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,184
But if we're ever going to have a baby,
we need some alone time, Mr. Allen.

115
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,690
- Great.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,485
- Ray?
- In the flesh.

117
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,698
What, uh... What brings you
to Central City?

118
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,742
Oh, well, you guys said
I could always crash here

119
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,912
if ever I was in town,
and I'm here attending CCTC.

120
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:54,248
But my hotel is overbooked,
and it's impossible to get

121
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:55,976
a conference hotel room
at the last minute.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,086
So I figured I'd take you up
on your very kind offer.

123
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,756
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Doesn't it?

124
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,218
Are you guys having pizza?
Is it gluten-free?

125
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,055
- No, it's from Italy.
- Oh.

126
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,308
So, where is Nora?
Did she come with you?

127
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,769
No, she's saving the world
one kid at a time

128
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,270
and loving it.

129
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,483
Am... Am I interrupting?

130
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,360
- Never.
- No.

131
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,611
Really? Great!

132
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,321
So is this a sofa bed

133
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,448
or like a sheets-and-blankets-on-top
sort of thing?

134
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,993
There is a guest bedroom
at the top of the stairs.

135
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,162
Aw! You guys are the best.

136
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,374
- I'll get the rest of my bags later.
- Okay.

137
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,295
- I thought he could shrink things.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,383
<i>Trucks at loading dock.</i>

139
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,927
Copy that. Transport team's here.

140
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,845
What the hell?

141
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,402
<i>In three seconds,
the two on the outside</i>

142
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,195
<i>will draw their weapons and advance,</i>

143
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,989
<i>while the other two
hold their positions.</i>

144
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,573
<i>Jack, you're up.</i>

145
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,038
I could have melted your faces instead.

146
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,165
Guess you drew a lucky hand.

147
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,311
<i>Ooh, their minds
are full of fear, Ten.</i>

148
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,004
<i>Show them who has the winning hand.</i>

149
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,011
- Jackpot.
- Oh, crap.

150
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,639
<i>My King, you know the drill.</i>

151
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,359
I guess he folded.

152
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,778
- Well, that's no fun.
- Either way,

153
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:54,243
that was damn fine work, My Queen.

154
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,664
Well, it's easy when you can see
each card before it's dealt.

155
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,292
My Queen.

156
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,642
- Now what?
- We raise the stakes.

157
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,111
There you go, Iris.

158
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:35,242
Uh, Ray, how often do you talk to Sara
and all the other Legends?

159
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,620
Well, not very often.

160
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,748
Nate and I do have
a standing drinks night once a month,

161
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,335
but he's rarely
in the same century or year.

162
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,855
Yeah, that may be
why I haven't heard from him lately.

163
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:49,214
It's okay.

165
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,715
Kind of.

166
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,677
Yeah, it was really hard
leaving the Legends,

167
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,599
but since then, Nora and I
have been more connected than ever.

168
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,060
And, you know,
I've been able to get back

169
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,771
to my other true love, pure research.

170
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,981
Plus, my life's more balanced now.

171
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,609
It's not just "I'm the Atom,
and science takes a backseat,"

172
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,029
you know so, yeah, to, uh...
To second acts.

173
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,115
I'll get it.

174
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,412
Is this year's Legacy Honoree
in the house?

175
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,736
Hey, Chester. Yeah, come on in.

176
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,959
Chester, Ray. Ray, Chester.

177
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,711
Ah, so you're the new team tech genius.

178
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,130
Nice to meet you, Chester.

179
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,421
Likewise.

180
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,402
I've been a big fan of yours ever since
reading your papers on quantum qubits.

181
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,553
So you're pretty stoked
about the con this year, huh?

182
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,054
Oh, are you kidding me?

183
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,825
Ever since I found out you were
going to be this year's Legacy Honoree,

184
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:44,145
I kind of took the liberty of signing up
to be a CCTC volunteer.

185
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,650
I'm going to be your liaison
for the entire event, if that's cool.

186
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,569
Like, if you're all right.

187
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:52,902
Sounds great.

188
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:56,115
Cool, because I already have your whole
itinerary planned to sweet perfection.

189
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,619
So, um, I'm late for work.

190
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,789
So, Ray, Chester, I'll pop by
the convention center later.

191
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,473
- Don't you dare...
- See ya, I gotta go.

192
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,461
Aw, he forgot his breakfast.

193
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,341
That's a bracelet. You know what?
I have to go, too... deadlines.

194
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:17,052
You got the list of questions
for the interview later, right?

195
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,804
Sure do. See you at 4:00.

196
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,895
Heard some paroled ex-cons
went shopping without their wallets.

197
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,938
OG meta-criminals, actually.

198
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:33,402
Jack, Ten, King and the Queen, they
call themselves the Royal Flush Gang.

199
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,197
They were Central City's
very first meta-threat.

200
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,465
You worked that case, too?

201
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,160
Actually, no. The first time
they pulled a job, I was...

202
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,666
...kind of under the weather.

203
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,255
It's weird. Their MO is stealing cash
from casinos, not microchips.

204
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,010
Well, at least no one was killed...
this time.

205
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,638
Everything okay, Captain?

206
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,186
This is the kind of case the meta
task force would have been assigned to.

207
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:12,149
Uh, so your mimic powers,

208
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,860
how exactly do they work?

209
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,279
They only activate in times of stress,

210
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,658
when my adrenaline spikes,
and the effects are temporary.

211
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,326
That's good.

212
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,369
Yeah.

213
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:29,166
Allen, does me being a meta
make working for me more difficult?

214
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,754
No, ma'am. It's already
tough enough as it is.

215
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,093
I'll let you know
as soon as I find something.

216
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:40,969
Okay.

217
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:49,687
So I've gone over everyone's ideas
and they're great.

218
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,940
But what I'd like to do is start with
last night's break-in at Mercury Labs.

219
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,279
It's not news, not in this city.

220
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,365
It's a high-tech theft
at a huge R&D corporation...

221
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,534
Which happens all the time in this town.

222
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,327
- Was anyone killed?
- No.

223
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,846
- Was the Flash involved?
- No. He isn't.

224
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,749
- Tragedy sells papers, folks. Sorry.
- But... That's not the point.

225
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,395
We should look into the rumors of
embezzlement inside the mayor's office.

226
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,421
Scooping a major scandal
before our competition...

227
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,839
Will make Iris happy.

228
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,525
Get in touch with someone
at the mayor's office.

229
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,176
I got 1,000 words to finish on
the Shark's new GM for Iris, too...

230
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,178
Wait. What 1,000 words?

231
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,823
Well, I know the mayor's
executive assistant.

232
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,266
I need someone on this Mercury break-in.

233
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,395
Vanya, I really need you
to run with this tech heist.

234
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,190
I'm going to follow up
on the Calvert collision this morning.

235
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,874
My source in the county planner's office

236
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,903
says it's going to cost several million
to repair the damage.

237
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,283
Talk about a budget crisis.
Plus, that is what Iris would want.

238
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:50,414
Well, hold on. Wait, guys... seriously?

239
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,128
We found this
at the train collision site.

240
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,465
I thought Kramer had you working
on the Mercury heist instead.

241
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,631
Yeah, I am.

242
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:01,632
You are,

243
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,805
but you think that it's related
to the Calvert train collision?

244
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,389
I will know in a minute.

245
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,225
While working evidence
from the Mercury Labs heist,

246
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,853
I found charred marks
on the guards' weapons.

247
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,189
Marks exactly like those.

248
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,649
Yeah, I was right.

249
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,403
Heat signature is the same as the burn
marks on the weapons at Mercury Labs.

250
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,782
Laser burns delivered
with pinpoint precision.

251
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,407
Jack's trademark.

252
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,951
Okay. Okay.

253
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:33,040
Even if it is the Royal Flush Gang
behind all of this, why?

254
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,125
Why would they go through
all the trouble

255
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,212
of causing a massive railway collision

256
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,506
when they haven't even
stolen anything yet?

257
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,007
I asked myself that, too.

258
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,052
Then I found out
what was being carried in this case.

259
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:51,308
A bleeding-edge, beryllium core,
which is a highly unstable power source.

260
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,952
And that's what caused
the trains to explode.

261
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,479
No, beryllium-based detonation
would have leveled

262
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,147
a surrounding ten-mile radius.

263
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,128
The core wasn't in the case
when the trains collided.

264
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:06,115
Which means the real question
is why is the Royal Flush Gang

265
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,991
changing their MO
to become tech thieves?

266
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,623
Korber, what's going on?

267
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,917
Iron Heights just lost power
for three seconds,

268
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,503
during which every cell door
unlocked and opened.

269
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,922
Now they've got a thousand inmates
roaming the facility.

270
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,674
Barry, if they get out...

271
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,757
Yeah, I know.

272
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,556
Barry, what happened?

273
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,646
I got the inmates back in their cells
before anyone got hurt.

274
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,441
But we've got a bigger problem.

275
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,319
Looks like the Royal Flush Gang
just leveled up, too.

276
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,703
Well, I am impressed.

277
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,373
A schedule timed to the minute,
including a coffee stop to recharge.

278
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,294
Best. Handler. Ever.

279
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,057
Oh, you're getting a whole lot more
than java at Jitters, my friend.

280
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,549
How about a dozen CCTC

281
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,761
entrepreneurial hopefuls, each with
their own game-changing startup idea,

282
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,389
ready to pitch in three minutes or less

283
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:17,519
to Ray Palmer, business behemoth,
scientific genius.

284
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,229
Am I right?

285
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
Okay, okay.

286
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,817
Come on. Let's go
make some dreams come true.

287
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:29,698
- Chester.
- Yeah.

288
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:30,967
What made you think that...

289
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,411
Oh, I just know how much
you used start-up investments

290
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,496
to expand Palmer Tech.

291
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,748
You just got, like, a nose for science.

292
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,101
But I also know you've been out
of the game for a little while,

293
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,252
so I figured I'd help
jumpstart the magic.

294
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,603
- Okay.
- And don't worry about Tech Con,

295
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,341
because your interview with Iris
isn't for another 90 minutes.

296
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,967
So we got time.

297
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,301
Hey, I got your back, man.

298
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,472
Thank you.
But I'm not worried about my schedule.

299
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,225
Oh, right, right.
You need a cronut first, obviously.

300
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,227
- Excuse me, can we...
- Chester.

301
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Chester...

302
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,898
I don't want to start
another tech business.

303
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,447
It's like I told Barry and Iris,
the only thing I want

304
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,492
to pursue these days is a balanced life.

305
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,454
That's why I haven't worn
the Atom suit in ages.

306
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,915
Uh-huh. But you're...

307
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,458
You're a Legend.

308
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,419
Was a Legend.

309
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,507
Now I suppose that's what Team Flash
is for.

310
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,512
Look, I know how
that might sound for the Atom,

311
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:39,184
but Ray Palmer's priorities are his wife
and working in his own lab.

312
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,687
I hope that you can understand that.

313
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,814
Yeah. No, no, I get it.

314
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,819
And, I am, uh... I am so sorry.

315
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,071
- It's okay. It's okay...
- Everyone.

316
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:58,036
Today's pitch sessions
are officially canceled.

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,621
- What?
- No, that's not fair.

318
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:03,166
Guy, guys, guys,
we are impinging on a great man's time.

319
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,004
So get... Go on, go on. Come on.

320
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,463
Sorry, everyone.

321
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,757
I still believe in you.

322
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,093
I like your sweater.

323
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,682
And I will, um, leave you

324
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,603
to get your privacy on,
and again I am...

325
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,104
I'm so sorry.

326
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,815
Chester, I...

327
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,637
Thank you so much for coming.

328
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,830
It's so exciting to have you here.

329
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,001
When I founded this conference
five years ago, I never would have

330
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,919
dreamed we'd get coverage like this.

331
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,255
- Well, this is pretty impressive.
- Yeah.

332
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,634
Hey, your press pass
gets you into our after parties.

333
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,219
Are you a fan of filk music,
by any chance?

334
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,221
Boss. Excuse me.

335
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,555
Can we talk?

336
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,849
We'll gab later.

337
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,979
- Hey.
- So I totally blew it at the office.

338
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,522
I told you I wasn't ready.

339
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,691
You got resistance from the staff.

340
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,818
They barely listened to me.

341
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,197
I'm pretty sure they think I don't have
enough experience, which I don't.

342
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,367
And they think that my suggestions
for which stories to cover are wrong.

343
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,285
Yeah, I figured that might happen.

344
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,079
Then why put me in charge?

345
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,580
Because you can handle it.

346
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:27,501
And dealing with this is a part
of growing into your new position.

347
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,086
Well, I am not growing.

348
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,171
I'm crashing and burning.

349
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,298
Iris, I can't do this.

350
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,632
Yes, you can.

351
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,093
How do you know?

352
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,138
Because you're exactly what
CCC Media needs.

353
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,974
You have a point of view
that's entirely your own.

354
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,936
And you know the city better than anyone
in that room, you grew up here.

355
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,398
You not only survived Iron Heights,
you came out on the other side a hero.

356
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,316
I could melt Taylor's face.

357
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,277
You went from juvenile delinquent
to voice of the people.

358
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,905
And I'm talking about your writing,
not your meta-powers.

359
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,729
Your articles speak to people
because you're one of them.

360
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,119
That's your point of view.

361
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,080
It's also how CCC Media
speaks to the city

362
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,833
and why people respond so strongly.

363
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:13,714
Okay, but being a journalist
and being in charge are way different.

364
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,092
Look, I know that it's scary,
but think how you leveled up as a meta.

365
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,335
I'm sure that was scary, too.

366
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:27,352
Try terrifying, but somehow I knew
I could handle an upgrade.

367
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,229
Okay, then do that at the office, too.

368
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,482
Your point of view
is perfect for this company.

369
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,360
You've already learned how to own it.
Now go sell it.

370
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,610
Go.

371
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,948
Sell it.

372
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,302
Turns out the Royal Flush Gang

373
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,203
kidnapped a prisoner named
Jared Haywood.

374
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,581
Had any luck tracking them down?

375
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:48,749
Not yet.

376
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,334
What about the Mercury Labs chip?

377
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,463
Chester's still trying to figure out
why the Royal Flush Gang would need it.

378
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,673
- Okay.
- Not anymore.

379
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,717
Turns out that chip is so cutting edge,

380
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,470
it has, like, a thousand
different applications,

381
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,638
so, sorry, I blew it.

382
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,724
It just seems to be my thing today.

383
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,475
Hey.

384
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,854
What's going on, Chester?
I'm sensing a whole lot of sadness.

385
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,777
Yeah. Aren't you supposed
to still be with Ray?

386
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:17,611
I have resigned as Ray's liaison.
Turns out, I messed that up, too.

387
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,821
I'm like, dead to him.

388
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,912
Oh, my God, Cecile. I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

389
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,664
No, no, it's okay. Hey,

390
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,542
you gotta go easy on yourself.

391
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,877
How?

392
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,380
The day I'm having, I feel like
I might as well just

393
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,634
gamble my per diem away
at the craps table with Grandma Runk.

394
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,011
And Tech Con's paying
in cryptocurrency this year,

395
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,493
which barely feels like real money,
even though it totally is.

396
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,061
What if the Royal Flush Gang
didn't change their MO?

397
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,815
Chester, can we find out
if any Star City casinos

398
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,441
also take cryptocurrency?

399
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,567
Yeah.

400
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,240
Hot damn! Turns out they all do.

401
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,575
Guess they'll happily take your money
however they can.

402
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,202
And check this out.

403
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,749
These casinos have over 50 mil
in their digital coffers.

404
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,168
So what exactly would
the Royal Flush Gang need

405
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,878
to pull off a heist like this?

406
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,381
A computer with a next-level microchip,

407
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,385
massive power source to run it...

408
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,349
and an expert in cyber-espionage
to execute the hack.

409
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,436
They didn't change their MO.

410
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,189
They just leveled up.

411
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,110
Okay, how do we stop them?

412
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,071
The second the hack starts,
I can trace it and ping the location.

413
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,364
And I'll be ready.

414
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,497
So, it's all done?

415
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,458
Transfer completed.
Who wants to be a millionaire?

416
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,917
I do.

417
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,670
Exactly.

418
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,840
And since more people means
smaller shares for us.

419
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,551
Someone's out of chips.

420
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,306
What the hell, man?
We've planned this for years

421
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,682
and now you're gonna kill me?

422
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,809
Of course not.

423
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,270
Jack is.

424
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:16,729
I'm all in.

425
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,150
It's over, people.

426
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,986
Haywood's back in Iron Heights.

427
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,154
Who wants to go next?

428
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,532
Oh, usually I know when to fold 'em.

429
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,912
You know, 50 million, it's a lot
to leave on the virtual table.

430
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,956
And since my Queen is a psychic,
who knows everything

431
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,875
you're going to do before you do it,

432
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,378
go ahead, Flash. We call.

433
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,757
Four to one. I like these odds.

434
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,842
Go ahead, Flashy.

435
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,595
Pick a card. Any card.

436
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>Execute a full house maneuver,
all of you. Now.</i>

437
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,674
Hey, bud.

438
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,389
What? This is impossible.

439
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,350
I read your mind.
I saw what you were planning

440
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,936
and then I trumped your hand
by going all in. How did you...

441
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,104
You can read minds?

442
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,231
I can think at super speed.

443
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,943
Your thoughts, after I read them,
you reshuffled the deck!

444
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,945
I guess the house doesn't always win.

445
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,870
I am so sorry, folks.

446
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,123
I know today did not go as planned.

447
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,834
But the rocky road of science
will not stop me

448
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,587
from bringing you
the best Tech Con coverage ever.

449
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,357
Hey Chester, you left before
I could thank you for help...

450
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,343
Yo, yo, yo it's my fellow science geek,
CSI Barry Allen!

451
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,679
- Hi.
- Good to see you, man. Good to see you.

452
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,931
- So, ixnay on the ashFlay talk...
- Yeah.

453
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,451
Thanks for coming
to my livestream, dude.

454
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,270
- Sure.
- And this is his first Tech Con ever.

455
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,230
- Somehow that's true.
- Yeah. Yeah, so...

456
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,398
- Barr.
- Yeah.

457
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,608
How awesome is all this?

458
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,254
It's pretty awesome. Have you seen
the Magnus Labs' Saturn simulation?

459
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,904
Dude. I was in it.

460
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,197
You can get in it?

461
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,826
Hey, Ray! There's Legacy Honoree,
Ray Palmer.

462
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,287
Come say hi.
You've seen some of these displays?

463
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,914
Yeah, I mean, the imagination
on display is just stellar.

464
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,834
- Hey, Chester...
- Welcome to my livestream, Mr. Palmer.

465
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,171
But hey, it's been a great
first day of webcasting.

466
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,964
So, how about we take a break?

467
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,301
- Good, 'cause then we can talk about...
- See you in ten, party people.

468
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,094
- Hold this please.
- Okay.

469
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,888
...talk about what happened earlier.

470
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,350
Well, he's not avoiding me.

471
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,354
Chester surprised me earlier
with a pitch fest

472
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,274
to mentor aspiring scientists and...

473
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,194
the intention of forming a startup
with one of them.

474
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:10,944
That sounds great.

475
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,364
And it would have been before, but...

476
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,826
I've grown a lot the last few months.

477
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,828
So, what? You don't miss any of this?

478
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,790
- I'm still a scientist, Barry.
- Yeah.

479
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,084
But, you know, if I start another
big tech company,

480
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,004
next thing I know...
I get lost in all this again.

481
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,423
This is all so intoxicating

482
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,843
and... I don't want
to fall back into the trap.

483
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,720
I get that, but...

484
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:40,141
I'm not the same that I was,
the first time I put on the cowl either.

485
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,478
I'm faster, more confident,
more at ease with myself.

486
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,688
Yeah. You've grown, too.

487
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:48,108
Yeah. One of the ways that's happened

488
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,819
is learning to take time out
to help Team Flash grow, too.

489
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,173
I've learned just as much from them
as they've learned from me.

490
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,407
It's like being a CSI.
Every day I work with

491
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,701
all my fellow officers
in all departments.

492
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,750
I mean... I do miss
scientific collaboration.

493
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,963
It's like I told Chester,
I'm not a Legend anymore.

494
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,757
And I don't have the C.C.P.D.

495
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,550
So what?

496
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,846
You're Ray Palmer, Legacy Honoree.

497
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,558
If you want something
that doesn't exist, invent it.

498
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,412
This copy is damn well-written.

499
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,999
What exactly are you looking for?

500
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,417
If you even know.

501
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,587
Look, these stories aren't bad.

502
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,131
They're well sourced. Thorough.

503
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:57,886
But, CCC Media is about more
than just providing facts.

504
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,513
It's the voice of the people,

505
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,683
which means
it needs to have something to say.

506
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,227
It's literally the opposite
of objective journalism.

507
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,688
How about we leave
the editorializing to Iris?

508
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,484
Okay, it's right there in the name.
<i>Central City Citizen.</i>

509
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,822
Yeah, you guys landed
some pretty major interviews,

510
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,743
but every person's voice
in this city deserves to be heard.

511
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,245
Not just the most famous
or high-profile ones.

512
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,790
So what, we're not even supposed to talk
to the DA or the mayor anymore?

513
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,125
Yes, talk to them.

514
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,670
But then go talk to the janitor
who cleans the mayor's office

515
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:37,008
or a mom working two jobs
just to pay her bills.

516
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:41,179
Because corruption in this city,
it affects them more than anyone.

517
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,850
Don't you guys see?
When we're at our best,

518
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:49,771
our readers see themselves
reflected in our stories.

519
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,359
So, try again.

520
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,988
But this time...
remember who you're writing for.

521
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,043
You've already
accomplished so much...

522
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,629
...and now you're a CCTC Legacy Honoree.

523
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,132
What's next for you? Retirement?

524
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,718
Uh...

525
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,305
Well, honestly I...

526
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,476
I'm not sure.

527
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,105
That question's come up
for me a lot today.

528
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,149
And, you know, I have been doing
a ton of research lately,

529
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:39,070
but, I also don't want to repeat
my previous achievements.

530
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:42,657
So, I guess I'm having
conflicting thoughts about it.

531
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,701
It's a tough decision.

532
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,079
So, you know what?

533
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,040
Maybe we should all find out together...

534
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,166
next year.

535
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,466
Okay, and on that note,

536
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,468
let's thank Ray Palmer
for joining us today.

537
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,354
You all should run.

538
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,403
<i>While you still can.</i>

539
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,530
Everybody go.

540
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,115
Go!

541
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Flash,

542
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,582
don't make this difficult.

543
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,335
Show yourself.

544
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,964
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone.

545
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,930
Why don't you just tell me
what it is you want?

546
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,177
Of course.

547
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,513
I came a long way to find you, Flash.

548
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,682
And now that I have,

549
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,478
I'm going to kill you.

550
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,613
Whoever you are,
if you're looking for a fight,

551
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,364
you found one.

552
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,786
Oh, snap!

553
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,704
Time for Flash to do what he does best

554
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
and kick some butt.

555
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,458
You're nothing like I expected.

556
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,919
Not that it matters.

557
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,254
Those who were once good

558
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,174
die just as easily.

559
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,190
- Oh, well, that's not good.
- What is that thing?

560
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,859
Oh, I'm picking up some
seriously advanced tech readings.

561
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,587
You just have that thing
in your back pocket?

562
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,321
No, I just picked it up
from right there.

563
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,074
Oh, yeah. Tech Con, right.

564
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,797
I think Barry's gonna need
a helping hand.

565
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:53,538
Wait. What?
Like a superhero team up with the Atom?

566
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,164
What changed your mind?

567
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,337
My friends. An old one and a new one.

568
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,131
But I'm still not a Legend.

569
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,092
Man, you're a hell of a lot more.

570
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,408
I was born amongst the stars, Flash.

571
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,618
Trapping me in a vacuum was pointless.

572
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:36,831
Now surrender...
and I promise you won't suffer.

573
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:41,794
And the suit still fits.

574
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,423
- Hey! You been working out?
- Yeah, thank you for noticing.

575
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,968
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

576
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,850
Flash! Atom! Who are you firing at?

577
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,518
Yeah, yeah. He's right behind you.

578
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,032
Oh, now I know how Diggle feels.

579
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,452
This guy isn't just strong.
I think he's messing with our minds.

580
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:15,952
<i>Correct.</i>

581
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,582
<i>This isn't your fight, Atom.
Now leave while you still can.</i>

582
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,708
Everyone has a weakness.

583
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,252
I'll keep him occupied.

584
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,608
You can't fool me
with a speed mirage, Flash.

585
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,110
My mind is too powerful.

586
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,154
Wait, you said I was good once.

587
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:54,033
What happened to me? You owe me that.

588
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,410
As you wish.

589
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,752
<i>Bear witness to a coming Armageddon</i>

590
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,046
<i>that you create ten years from now.</i>

591
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,591
<i>One that destroys your own planet.</i>

592
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,178
It's already happened, Flash.

593
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,681
That's why I, Despero, have to kill you.

594
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,142
It's how I save our world.

595
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,324
No!

596
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,245
- Man, whatever you did...
- Any time, Flash.

597
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:40,621
- Hey!
- Hey, you guys okay?

598
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,038
Yeah.

599
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,207
Where'd that thing go?

600
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,209
I don't know.

601
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,929
Barry, you know you're not destined
to destroy the world, right?

602
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:00,516
Yeah, I know. But the visions Despero
showed me seemed so real.

603
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,310
And he said "our world."

604
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,020
But what does that even mean?

605
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,771
I don't know... yet.

606
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,356
What if he's mind-punking you?

607
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,568
Like how he made you and Ray
see an illusion during your fight?

608
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:12,903
I don't think he was.

609
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,072
Every test I've run on Barry shows that

610
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,408
he's completely fine,
mentally and physically.

611
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,286
Well, I scanned the residual feelings
that Despero left behind

612
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,539
inside your mind,
and there was no doubt.

613
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,876
Despero was telling the truth.
He really did see those things.

614
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,628
Which means everyone's in danger.

615
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:31,839
No, no. There's no way that you're
the bad guy in this situation.

616
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,425
What we need to do right now
is find out the truth.

617
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,552
I have a bad feeling it's gonna find us.

618
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,430
Once Despero gets back
from wherever Ray sent him.

619
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:43,476
Yeah. Well, the tech inside
his belt was so complex,

620
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,853
I could barely recognize
the navigation system.

621
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,398
So, instead of sending him to a specific
location, I tried a random setting.

622
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,233
Who knows where he went.

623
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,319
- Or when he's coming back.
- Barr...

624
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:56,447
how do we beat
a ten-foot-tall red alien,

625
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,325
who thinks like Grodd
and punches like Fuerza?

626
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,161
By figuring out
what kind of alien he is.

627
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,373
Get that and you may have some idea
of what his weaknesses are.

628
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,667
- Like Kryptonians.
- And Kryptonite.

629
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,044
Great idea. I'll call Alex
in National City.

630
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,253
Yeah. So what do we do?

631
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,756
Well, he took our best shots
like they were nothing.

632
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,841
- We need to be ready.
- For what?

633
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:17,968
The fight of our lives.

634
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,057
Iris.

635
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:27,144
This account of Despero
fighting Flash and Atom,

636
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,645
it's amazing.

637
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,063
Is Barry okay?

638
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,568
Yeah, it's just Despero is like
no one we've ever faced before.

639
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:36,695
Any notes?

640
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,739
Just one. Publish this.

641
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,200
Now. People need to read it.

642
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,620
You saw everything and survived.
The city needs to know it can, too.

643
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,332
By the way, I read the revised articles

644
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,418
that you had Vanya, Aariz
and Taylor write.

645
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,043
And?

646
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,296
We're going straight to print
with all of them.

647
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,901
Whatever you did to inspire
quality work like this,

648
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,343
it must have gotten through.

649
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,719
Thank God.

650
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,181
But they're still not happy with me.

651
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,225
Mm. Welcome to management.

652
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,940
Are you sure you don't
need me to stick around?

653
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,419
Nora can handle any
supernatural emergencies while I'm gone,

654
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,611
and like you said, Despero
could come back any minute.

655
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,906
It's okay. We're on it,
and if Despero comes back again...

656
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:23,200
The Atom will embiggen, yeah?

657
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:25,870
No? All right. Keep working on that one.

658
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,457
Chester, what you did
back there at Jitters...

659
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,376
- Was a huge mistake, I know...
- Was the best gift possible.

660
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,254
Between that and helping Barry
again as the Atom,

661
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,548
I have now realized
that there's a middle ground

662
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,135
to this whole balance thing.
Which is why I want to return the favor.

663
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,346
So, what if I created
a non-profit organization

664
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,932
to fund young scientists
like your Jitters friends?

665
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,811
- That would be awesome.
- Great!

666
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,564
I was thinking I could call it
the Quincy P. Runk Foundation,

667
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,066
if that's okay?
Barry told me about your father.

668
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,238
Oh!

669
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:09,830
Uh... Yeah. If you ever need, like,
a consultant or anything like that.

670
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:10,914
I know who to call.

671
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,252
Oh, and, Barry...

672
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,587
There's one sure way to prove to Despero
that you'd never destroy the world.

673
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:20,757
What's that?

674
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,995
Just show him who you really are.

675
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,644
Like you do with this team
each and every day.

676
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,944
Barry, we got an alien signal
coming in hot.

677
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,488
Barry, are you sure about this?

678
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,240
Yeah, it's like Ray said,

679
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,135
the only way to convince Despero
I'm not a threat,

680
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,536
is to show him who I really am.

681
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,333
Prepare to die, Flash.

682
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,460
Every life ends sooner or later.

683
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,046
Wise words from a dead man.

684
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,816
Despero, I'm not going to
fight you again.

685
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,883
Really? I'm disappointed.

686
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,719
Striking down a defenseless foe?

687
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:08,347
Well, there's no pleasure in that.

688
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,557
So you enjoy killing?

689
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:15,479
Twist my words at your own risk!

690
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:17,773
You wanted to kill me.

691
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,859
I'm not running anywhere.

692
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,991
Neither am I.

693
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,036
In another time, on another world,

694
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,998
we could've fought side by side,
you and I.

695
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,293
There's great strength in you, Flash.

696
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,503
But I've seen your future.

697
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,883
The lives you take,
the betrayals you revel in.

698
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:46,886
You're the most dangerous kind of killer

699
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:50,139
because you hide in the body of a hero.

700
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,265
I'm not a killer.

701
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,686
I'm not whatever you think I am.
I can prove it.

702
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:59,273
If you let me show you the truth.
Or are you gonna take an innocent life

703
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,025
just to prove you're right?

704
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,403
You're either very stupid or very brave.

705
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,448
I can't decide which.

706
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,366
Find out. Scan my mind.

707
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,619
See for yourself, then decide.

708
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,502
I see no deception in your mind.

709
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:27,635
But I do see truth... and honor.

710
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:34,391
Flash, you're asking me
to risk allowing the future

711
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,268
I've already witnessed, to unfold.

712
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,438
I'm sorry.

713
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,900
There's too many lives at stake.

714
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,320
Don't you see? This is why I came back.

715
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:49,990
This is the purpose
that I swore to uphold.

716
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,700
What if you're wrong about me?

717
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,040
I've spent my entire life
protecting this world.

718
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,103
All I'm asking for is a chance to prove
I'd never turn my back on it.

719
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,129
Why should I believe you?

720
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,000
Because my name is Barry Allen.

721
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,389
And I have nothing to hide.

722
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,227
Your boldness impresses me, Flash.

723
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,314
And has earned you a stay of execution.

724
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,277
You now have seven Earth days to prove
that you won't become the monster

725
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,196
I've already witnessed in the future.

726
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,991
If you can't convince me in that time

727
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:35,202
or if I find any trace
of a darker nature,

728
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,330
I will end your existence.
