1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,424
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,053
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,104
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,392
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,519
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,231
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,409
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,737
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,531
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,283
His name is Geomancer.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,122
I'm waiting on the man in red.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,286
The Velocity-Seven's wearing off!

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,459
- You hurt?
- My pride.

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,457
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,377
Daddy? Please help me.
Don't let him take me back there.

16
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,512
I told you, we're a team.
Now you're a part of it.

17
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,140
We're going to help you save Jesse.
We're not sending you through alone.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,345
We're going to Earth-2.

19
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,261
Just remember what Jay said, okay?
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

20
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,974
- Caitlin.
- Lf you knew me at all,

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,980
you would know
that I hate the name "Caitlin."

22
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,062
I'm Killer Frost.

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,985
Iris, look out!

24
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,440
Dad!

25
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,030
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,987
He shouldn't have pal-ed
around with a breacher.

27
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,072
Flash, save us!

28
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,535
Zoom wanted him alive!

29
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,244
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him!

30
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,996
No!

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,163
- Barry!
- Look around, Flash.

32
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:24,301
This is the last place you'll ever see.

33
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,303
Iknow you're here, Harrison Wells.

34
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,266
And you did not come alone.

35
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,558
You can try to hide,

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,073
but I'm the fastest man alive.

37
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,241
I will scour this city
until I hunt you down.

38
00:01:55,407 --> 00:02:01,130
And when I do,
all of you will feel my wrath.

39
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,045
C.C.P.N. is reporting
that Dr. Harrison Wells,

40
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,090
the infamous founder of S. 7'.A.R. Labs
who uncharacteristically

41
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,260
has gone unseen for nearly four months,
is now a wanted man.

42
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,223
These images and messages went up moments
ago throughout Central City by Zoom.

43
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,058
Have you seen Channel 52?

44
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,022
You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.
Zoom's looking for you.

45
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,653
I know what he's doing. Alert security.

46
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,609
Evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs.
Lock down the facility.

47
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,945
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me, Henry.

48
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,701
Just get everyone out of here now.
Now! Go!

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,197
Harry... Don't shoot!

50
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,032
Damn it, Ramon.

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,622
Where's Allen?

52
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,458
- Zoom took him.
- What?

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,669
We tracked down Deathstorm and Killer
Frost, met my doppelganger, Reverb.

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,549
Super evil guy, super evil powers.

55
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,430
The three of them almost took down Barry
until Zoom showed up, killed Cisco-2,

56
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,215
killed Deathstorm for hurting a speedster,

57
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,352
but then he left Killer Frost alive
and then took off with Barry.

58
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,762
How are you still alive?

59
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,101
Looks like he cares even less about me
than you do, Harry.

60
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,484
No. No, Zoom doesn't do anything
by accident. Did he follow you here?

61
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,816
I've seen Heat like 50 times, okay?
I know how to shake a tail.

62
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,730
He didn't follow me. But check this out.

63
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,399
I jacked these from my dead ringer.

64
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,613
I think we can tweak these puppies,
use them to find Zoom.

65
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,744
Damn, it.
Ramon, we don't have time for this.

66
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,201
Zoom is hunting us. Zoom is hunting us!

67
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,958
We need to make an alternate plan
because if we don't, Zoom is...

68
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,494
Stop thinking like that, okay?

69
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,755
We're gonna find Jesse and
we're gonna find Barry. I know we will.

70
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,257
Hello? Is anyone there?

71
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:32,798
Okay, whoever's responsible for this,
oh boy, we're gonna have words.

72
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,137
The two of us, okay? This is not okay.

73
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,467
Barry-2.

74
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,107
Dr. Wells, this is very disappointing.

75
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,439
I mean, the two of you
should be ashamed of yourselves.

76
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,899
You can'tjust lock someone
in a room like this.

77
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,655
How long was I in here for?

78
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,825
Barely a day.

79
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,443
One day?

80
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,994
One day?

81
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,827
Oh, geez, my wife's
going to be worried sick.

82
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,161
- Dr. Wells.
- Yeah?

83
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,041
Doctor, I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,170
but my wife is
a very well respected detective

85
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,500
in the Central City Police Department.

86
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,041
She's gotta be very upset.

87
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,751
Whoa, this is heavy.

88
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,841
It certainly is. And I'm sorry, fellas,

89
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,891
but I demand to know what the heck
is going on here. This instant.

90
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,684
Barry, this is a very long story.

91
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,186
Ramon, we don't have time
to tell right now.

92
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,348
We're sorry we locked you in that room for
a day, but right now you need to leave.

93
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,858
You need to gather...

94
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,735
- What is that?
- He's here.

95
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,231
GUNS COCKING

96
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,192
Do not move!

97
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,584
Where are Wells and his friends?

98
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,627
Dr. Wells. Hey, what the heck is going on?

99
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,046
Oh, Zoom's after us.

100
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,089
Zoom? Why would Zoom be after you?

101
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,223
That's part of that long story
I was telling you about.

102
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,555
I don't know if I can...
Deal with something like this.

103
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,391
- You have a time vault?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,397
I'm an enemy of Zoom and need a place to
hide when something like this happens.

105
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,978
- Get in.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,779
That's Zoom. That's Zoom.

107
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,114
Ramon.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,078
Shut him up.

109
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,473
Okay. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

110
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,426
- Same as the...
- Fake wall.

111
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,266
He's not gonna fall for another fake wall.
We need to move.

112
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,305
We need to find a different place to hide
and make a plan.

113
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,767
Wait. Wait. Hey, hey, hey. No.

114
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,607
I think before we do anything,
you have to explain to me

115
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,942
everything that is going on here.

116
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,292
You're wasting your time.

117
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,044
I used to think I could escape too
when I first got here,

118
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,747
but there's no way out.

119
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,294
Who is that?

120
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,179
I don't know.

121
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,675
He's been here since Zoom brought me
to this place.

122
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,396
Look, stop, okay? Just please stop.

123
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,652
Jesse, I think he might be
trying to help us.

124
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,189
Nothing is going to help us.

125
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,566
That's not true.

126
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,284
We're gonna get out of here.
Your dad's gonna find us. I promise.

127
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,498
You sure have a lot of faith in a man
who only cares about himself.

128
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:56,000
You know,
I actually thought that at first, too.

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,672
But it's not true.

130
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,267
Every decision that he's made,
every action he's taken since we've met,

131
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,011
it's been to save you.

132
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,559
You dad hasn't given up on you, Jesse.
Don't give up on him.

133
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,444
Believe what you want,

134
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,986
but the only reason
that you're still alive

135
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,824
is so I can kill you
in front of your father.

136
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,619
And the only reason
your father's still alive

137
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,920
is to get me your speed.

138
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,055
Once he does that, he will die, too.

139
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,852
Up after the break,
earthquake-causing meta-human

140
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,689
leaves citizens shaken and wondering
where is the Flash?

141
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,855
It's finished.
The breach, it's stabilized again.

142
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,898
Barry, Cisco and Wells
have 20 hours to get back.

143
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,157
You're amazing.

144
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,239
When it comes to stabilizing breaches,
maybe.

145
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,575
Not so much when it comes to fighting
meta-humans.

146
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,205
You were a little rusty.

147
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,619
I was too slow.

148
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,327
Geomancer's still out there, Caitlin.

149
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,498
He has to be stopped. I have to be ready
in case he attacks again.

150
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,167
- How much longer until the Velocity...
- Eight.

151
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,010
Velocity-Eight is ready?

152
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,715
I need to finalize the compound,

153
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,514
make sure the extracellular matrix
stays intact

154
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,926
so you don't lose your speed as fast.

155
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,765
Okay. Great.

156
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,517
What is it?

157
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,357
After your last encounter with Geomancer,
I ran some tests.

158
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:44,067
The Velocity-Seven is reacting
with the damaged cells in your body.

159
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,234
It's causing more cellular degeneration.

160
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,450
Well, I have faith that the next batch
won't do the same thing.

161
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,240
Jay, I can't keep giving this to you
if it's hurting you.

162
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,165
If it'll help me defeat Geomancer,
you might have to.

163
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,461
Until Barry gets back,
I may be the only chance this city has.

164
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,464
I don't know how this is possible,
but you somehow made basketball

165
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,758
sound more boring than baseball. Fix this.

166
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,597
Scott Evans. Your new editor.

167
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,016
- Oh. Iris...
- West. I know.

168
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,022
You wrote the story
about the recent Geomancer attack.

169
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,603
- Yeah, I did.
- I'm not running that.

170
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,813
What? Why?

171
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,398
It's a fluff piece to try to make people
feel good.

172
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,814
What they need to know is the truth.

173
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,654
The Flash might not always be there
to save them.

174
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,159
You disagree?

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,034
I think that he's saved a lot of people
in this city.

176
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,538
But where is he now?
I need to run a real story.

177
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,749
Okay, uh, what if I could get you

178
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,961
an exclusive with the meta-human
that fought Geomancer?

179
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,797
This other Flash?

180
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,427
What? You're friends with him, too?

181
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,683
Just, um, give me a little time.

182
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,095
Fine. But if it's the same
as the other crap that you wrote,

183
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,888
I'm gonna run something
about how the Flash

184
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,308
may not be the hero we all dreamed he was.

185
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,527
Iris. Hey, Iris.

186
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,076
- Barry, where were you last night?
- Oh, my God.

187
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,830
My father died yesterday,
and you never even came home.

188
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,457
I know. I know, I heard. I'm so, so sorry.

189
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,165
What? You heard? You were there, Barry.

190
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,049
I actually was not there.

191
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,212
Yeah, okay.
Okay, look, come to my lab.

192
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,301
Just come up to my lab.
I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

193
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,635
I'm gonna explain it.

194
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,643
So the Barry
from yesterday was not you.

195
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,940
No. No, look, I know that this is

196
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,397
hard to believe, butl mean,
it is just like that sci-fi series,

197
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,358
Commander Carl:
Space Marshal of the Galaxy,

198
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,490
where Carl gets sucked into a black hole
and ends up on another planet

199
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,905
that he thinks is Earth, but really
it's Earth of another universe.

200
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,992
Have you guys not seen... Oh, it's a
seminal episode. You should check it out.

201
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,579
So that's why you weren't wearing
your wedding ring yesterday.

202
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,333
- Well...
- And that kiss was so...

203
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,427
I'm sorry, he got frisky with you?

204
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,173
No, no, no. Okay, I'm gonna have to find
this guy and give him a piece of my mind.

205
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,431
Well, don't give him too much.

206
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,468
Your husband tells us
you've been tracking Zoom.

207
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,433
- Yeah. I've been trying to. Why?
- We need to find his lair.

208
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,769
- "Lair"?
- He's a bad guy, I'm calling it a lair.

209
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,434
Zoom is looking for you.
Why are you going after him?

210
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,647
Zoom has my daughter and our Barry,
and we need to rescue them both.

211
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,452
Look, I wanna find Zoom just as much as
anybody, but no one can track him.

212
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,742
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

213
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,203
Would be a meta that's worked with him.

214
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,751
A meta like Killer Frost?

215
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,882
Yeah, maybe, but Zoom kept her alive
yesterday because she always obeys him.

216
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,589
There's no way
that she's gonna tell you where he is.

217
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,798
I'm not so sure about that.

218
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,214
If she loved Deathstorm
as much as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

219
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,554
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

220
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,764
Look, finding her is gonna be just as hard
as finding Zoom.

221
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,397
But if anyone can do it,

222
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,396
my husband can.

223
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,946
Right. Yes, I can actually.

224
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,235
Um...

225
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,904
All right.

226
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,750
Okay, well, looks like Patty Spivot
was the CSI tech

227
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,083
on most of the Killer Frost cases.
She's pretty thorough, so...

228
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,379
What's that?

229
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,922
Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data
collected from numerous crime scenes.

230
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,510
DNA trace movements, facial recognition,
temperature fluctuations specific to her.

231
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,426
My algorithm compiles all the data
and gives us an approximate location.

232
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,061
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom of course.

233
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,269
- He's too fast, never leaves a trace.
- That's good.

234
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,023
Okay. Looks like the best bet's
the woodlands.

235
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,901
- Best CSI in Central City.
- No.

236
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,191
- You know where that is, right?
- Yeah. Let's go.

237
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,243
Wait, I'm going with you guys.
You're gonna need some help.

238
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,949
- Okay.
- Iris.

239
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,367
Barry, Zoom and his followers
are the reason that my father is dead.

240
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,003
If I can stop him from killing
anyone else, I'm gonna try.

241
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,421
- Okay, then I'm coming, too.
- No.

242
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,708
No.

243
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,554
Barry, this is not what you do.

244
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,849
I know that, but...

245
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,471
I also know Joseph didn't like me
too much, but he was my father-in-law.

246
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,563
If you're going, I am coming with you.

247
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,533
All right. You can come,
but you stay out of our way.

248
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,159
Okay.

249
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,704
That's not Morse code.

250
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:52,082
I know he's trying to tell us something.
We just have to find the pattern.

251
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,432
There's no pattern, Barry.

252
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,392
You know your dad,

253
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:12,026
who I'm pretty sure is one of the smartest
people to live on either of our Earths,

254
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:16,816
told me the only person smarter than him
was you.

255
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,568
He said that?

256
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,037
If that's true, we work together,

257
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,834
I know we can figure this out.

258
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,169
Worth a shot?

259
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,462
Okay.

260
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,644
Well, he never goes past five.

261
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,024
What?

262
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,820
He never goes past five knocks
without pausing, right? Listen.

263
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,537
Yeah, you're right.

264
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,830
I think I know what that is.

265
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,543
It's a five-by-five tap code used by POWs.

266
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,962
That would only get us to 25 letters,
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

267
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,678
No, not if you combine C and K.
They sound the same.

268
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,809
Let's try it out.

269
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,640
- Worth a shot.
- All right.

270
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,317
- There it is.
- Lt looks different than before.

271
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,024
That's because I realized that
there was a flaw with Velocity-Eight,

272
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,319
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix and...

273
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,779
Velocity-Nine.

274
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,365
You know what they say.
Ninth time's the charm.

275
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,870
Hey.

276
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,202
Hey, Iris. You okay?

277
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,421
Yeah. I'm just a little worried
about the time.

278
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,417
Well, don't worry. They'll make it back
before we close the breach.

279
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,014
Um, actually, I was here to talk to you
about something else.

280
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,056
Oh, yeah, sure, what is it?

281
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:10,891
Well, my new editor
wants me to write a scathing article

282
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,145
on the Flash not being able to protect
Central City from Geomancer.

283
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,443
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,281
I was hoping
to write an article about you instead.

285
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,403
Something that would calm people
until Barry got back.

286
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,198
You know, Iris,
I don't know if that's the best idea.

287
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:35,207
Well, I think that if people knew that
there was someone that could protect them,

288
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,871
it would really help.

289
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,249
Would you just think about it?

290
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,349
Some crazy alarm's going on.

291
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,685
Don't even think about running.

292
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,514
There's a new Flash in town.

293
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,274
You know, the one with the shiny helmet.

294
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,856
Not the speedsterl was hoping to crack,

295
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,990
but let's see just how fast he is,
Central City.

296
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,783
- Give me the Velocity-Nine.
- Jay, we've no idea how long it'll last.

297
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,748
We don't have time to figure that out,
Caitlin.

298
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:23,772
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

299
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,923
Jay.

300
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,092
I'm okay. Thatjust took a lot out of me.

301
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,220
But it sure felt good.

302
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,595
That was amazing, Jay.

303
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,102
Thanks, I kind of surprised myself,
to be honest.

304
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,398
Caitlin deserves all the credit.
Looks like your Velocity-Nine's a winner.

305
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,855
I still need to run some tests.

306
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,779
Iris, about the interview. Um...

307
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,865
I think that I have
everything that I need.

308
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,742
Great.

309
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,157
'Cause I could really use a nap.

310
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,202
I'll, uh, be downstairs.

311
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,629
Two down, five across.

312
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,797
- It's J.
- J?

313
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,554
That's what you're tapping? The letter J?

314
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,973
All right, what's next?

315
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,057
A-

316
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,017
All right.

317
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,687
Five down.

318
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,779
Four across. Y.

319
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,993
J -A-Y?

320
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,661
You're spelling "Jay."

321
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,365
As in Jay Garrick?

322
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,954
He's alive, but he's on my Earth.

323
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,583
Hey, hey. Stop. Stop.

324
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,173
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know what you mean.

325
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,759
Jay Garrick didn't come with us.

326
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,218
Look, just keep tapping, please.
We don't understand.

327
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,644
Please.

328
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,647
Don't talk to them again.

329
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm going to get out of here.
And I'm going to destroy you.

330
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,969
All I need from you is your speed, Flash.

331
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,978
And you only need to be barely alive
for me to get it.

332
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,021
Stop!

333
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,030
Stop!

334
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,873
Barry.

335
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,330
Barry, are you okay?

336
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,881
Yeah.

337
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,717
I'm okay.

338
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,512
Zoom just showed me
how to get out of this thing.

339
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,363
You're sure this is the place?

340
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,278
This is definitely the place.

341
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,997
You lost?

342
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,825
Orjust back for more fun?

343
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,082
- We just came here to talk.
- Oh, really?

344
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,799
Do you bring your little toys
to every conversation you have?

345
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,885
Or do you just want to see me burn again?

346
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,715
Considering you killed my father,
the thought has crossed my mind.

347
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:39,924
Tell us.

348
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,844
Where does Zoom keep his prisoners?

349
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,056
You really don't know how to
use your abilities, do you, breacher?

350
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,106
It's a work in progress, Elsa.

351
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,856
Zoom killed the love of your life.

352
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,191
This hurts,

353
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,073
even for somebody
with a heart as cold as yours.

354
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,910
And you think
that would make me turn on Zoom?

355
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,032
The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

356
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,416
What? Don't tell rne
it doesn't work like that over here.

357
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,127
If I tell you, he'll kill me.

358
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,716
But ifl kill you and take you to him,

359
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,599
I bet he'd be pretty pleased with me.

360
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,302
Maybe even let me off my leash.

361
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,641
So take a wild guess.
What do you think I'm going to choose?

362
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:30,854
Move!

363
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,863
That did not go as planned.

364
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,615
Her name starts with "Killer."
This comes as a shock to you?

365
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,742
- We gotta move now.
- Yeah, yeah.

366
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,951
- I will cover you.
- Okay.

367
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,790
No, no, no. Hey, that's a horrible idea.

368
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,535
Hey, no. Hey, hey. No. Please, guys.

369
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,338
Okay.

370
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Stop.

371
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,686
Or you'll never make another icicle again.

372
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,998
I can't believe it.

373
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,251
What is it?

374
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,997
I think I figured out
how to save Jay's life.

375
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,793
Hey, Jay. Um, wake up.

376
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,836
Come to the Cortex. It's important.

377
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,593
It certainly is.

378
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,476
What do you want?

379
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,764
I like to watch heroes fall

380
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,941
and never get back up.

381
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,646
He always gets back up.

382
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,730
Hard to do that
when the Earth swallows you whole.

383
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,920
Where is it?

384
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,581
Oh, don't go.

385
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,550
We're having so much fun.

386
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,139
Oh, my God! Caitlin!

387
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,760
Caitlin, are you okay?

388
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,813
Looks like this new Flash
isn't much of a hero after all.

389
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,486
Let's see what a seven will do
to S.T.A.R Labs.

390
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,213
- Nice shot.
- I was aiming for his leg.

391
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,293
Where's Zoom's lair?

392
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,509
Where is it?

393
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,343
If I tell you, he will kill me.

394
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,428
He'll kill you anyway, Caitlin.

395
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,269
Stop calling me that. It's not my name.

396
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,059
Yes, it is. You just don't wanna hear it

397
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,899
because it reminds you
of someone you used to be.

398
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,107
Trust me, I know that person very well.

399
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,404
You don't know anything about me.

400
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,865
I know the Caitlin Snow on my Earth.

401
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,949
I know that when she loves someone,
that person is her world.

402
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,619
That person was Ronnie Raymond.
And he died, too.

403
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,748
That devastated her,
and I can see it's doing the same to you.

404
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,881
Zoom took that.

405
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,718
His daughter, my friend.

406
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,596
He's gonna take them away from us,

407
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,057
just like he took Ronnie from you.

408
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:56,893
Caitlin.

409
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,402
All you have to do is tell us
where he's keeping them.

410
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,240
And then you'll never hear from us again,
and then you can go.

411
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,492
Please.

412
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,708
Fine.

413
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,953
I'll show you where it is.

414
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,456
But that's it.

415
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,508
Where are we going?

416
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,840
Ascension Cliffs.

417
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,636
God!

418
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,017
Look, are you sure
you want to keep doing that?

419
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,603
You know, if Zoom catches you,
he's gonna hurt you again.

420
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,357
I don't understand why I can't
phase through this.

421
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,027
Well, your body would need to have
the same resonance as the glass walls.

422
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,324
I should be going more than fast enough.
It's something else.

423
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,571
Maybe you're resonating
at a different frequency?

424
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,124
Yeah. Your Earth vibrates
at a different frequency than mine.

425
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,501
Same reasons Cisco can't vibe.

426
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,084
Is there any way
to make up the difference?

427
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,470
Only if I can go faster.

428
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,569
Well, well, well.

429
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,572
We're going up there?

430
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,448
That's where Zoom's lair is.

431
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,701
A place only a speedster could get to.

432
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,528
They're like the Cliffs of Insanity.

433
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,748
So how do we get up there?

434
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,203
I can make you something to climb on,
darling.

435
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,254
Are you serious?

436
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:51,012
You want us to, what, just climb to the
top of those cliffs on ice?

437
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,260
Got any better ideas?

438
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,054
No, ma'am. I'm just...
You know, I've got...

439
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,938
You know, I'm wearing wing tips here.
They, um, don't have much tread.

440
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,317
Barry, Barry, urn,
maybe you should stay behind, yeah?

441
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,438
No. Hey, no. I'm not letting you
go up there by yourself.

442
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:12,700
It is okay if you don't wanna go,
if you don't want to do this.

443
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,572
You're my wife.

444
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,987
I'm not leaving your side.

445
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,118
Okay.

446
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,453
- Can we go?
- Yeah.

447
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,663
I'm ready.

448
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,537
Let's go before I change my mind.

449
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,807
- You really think handcuffs can stop me?
- I know they can.

450
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,227
Just like this boot on your neck,
it dampens your power.

451
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,102
Same goes for the six-by-six cell
you'll be calling home at Iron Heights.

452
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,812
All right, let's go.

453
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,147
Caitlin.

454
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,943
- So sorry I didn't come sooner.
- That's okay. Um...

455
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,403
Can I show you something?

456
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,580
My cells.

457
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,247
They stopped degenerating.
How is this even possible?

458
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,162
It appears that when the Velocity-Nine
is in your system,

459
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,503
it kick-starts your latent
regenerative capabilities

460
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,794
and your cells repair themselves.

461
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,929
And do you think you can get this
to work permanently?

462
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,807
I don't know,
but I think we're on the right track.

463
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,687
Caitlin, I don't know what to say.
This is...

464
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,015
You are...

465
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,524
- What's that?
- The speed cannon.

466
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,531
- Geomancer's tremors must have damaged it.
- Okay. Come on.

467
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,316
Come on.

468
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,873
The breach isn't stabilized.
We need to fix this fast.

469
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,467
Otherwise, they're never going to be
able to come back.

470
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,313
So that was the sound that we heard.

471
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,312
Please tell me
it's not as bad as it looks.

472
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,898
- Uh...
- Come on, seriously?

473
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,485
They still have an hour left.

474
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,363
What if they're trying to get through the
breach right now and they can't?

475
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,285
Okay, the jolt disrupted the quark matter.

476
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,538
The electromagnetic insulators
are failing.

477
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,494
How do we fix this in time?

478
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,957
I don't know if we can.

479
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,013
Barry?

480
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,431
Barry?

481
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,017
Hey, Cisco.

482
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,110
Dude, we made it.

483
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,816
How did you find this place?

484
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,399
Had some help.

485
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,277
Don't even get me started on this guy.

486
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,241
Oh, boy.

487
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,583
Dr. Wells.

488
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,296
Stand back.

489
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,394
I'm here. I'm here.

490
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,401
Come on, let's get you out of here.

491
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,687
Okay.

492
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,988
Frost.

493
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,074
- A little help?
- Not part of the deal.

494
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,830
- Frost!
- Hey, hey, hey.

495
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,366
Bringing us up here wasn't part of the
deal either, but here you are.

496
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,535
Something tells me you're not as cold
as I thought you were.

497
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,880
Maybe. Maybe not.

498
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,816
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

499
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,195
I don't know.
I've never had this problem before.

500
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,073
Dr. Wells.

501
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,534
Carbyne. It's some form of carbyne.

502
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,284
This cell's made of some form of carbyne.

503
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,200
You'll never be able
to freeze him out of there.

504
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,868
You can't phase out of there?

505
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,799
Just go, all right?
Before Zoom comes back.

506
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,592
We're not leaving you here.

507
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,176
I can't get out of this cell. I've tried.

508
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,589
A lot.

509
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,391
I'm not fast enough to phase through this.
You got...

510
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,685
Just leave all right?

511
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,059
Just leave.

512
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:07,661
D0 you know
what we did to get here, Barry?

513
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,543
We convinced her, Killer Frost,
to show us the way.

514
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:20,625
Then we climbed some insanely steep cliffs
outside on footholds made of ice. Ice.

515
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,087
And all of us risked our lives, knowing
Zoom was after us, to rescue Jesse

516
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,173
and you.

517
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:33,262
Now, I don't know you
and you don't know me, but

518
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,935
I can tell you that, today, I did things
that I never thought possible

519
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,520
because I needed to prove to my wife and

520
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,113
to myself that I could.

521
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,445
And now if I can do the impossible today,
so can you.

522
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,366
I'm just Barry Allen.

523
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,952
But you are the Flash.

524
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:09,132
If you tell yourself you can phase
out of there, you'll do it.

525
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,093
- Okay, let's go.
- Go.

526
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,058
Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.
We're not leaving him.

527
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,639
Barry, there's no time.

528
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:04,775
He's not going anywhere,
and neither are any of you.

529
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,317
Thank you for bringing them to me.

530
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,447
You double-crossed us?

531
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,119
He killed Ronnie.

532
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,784
Guess my heart is as cold
as you thought after all.

533
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,617
I can't believe you.

534
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,041
Just so you know, you would be
very disappointed in you right now.

535
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,250
Zoom, let them go.

536
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,461
All you need is me and Barry.

537
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,088
You're right.

538
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,641
I may not be able to kill you yet,

539
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,220
but I can kill them.

540
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,474
No, no.

541
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,070
I told you I'd kill you
in front of your father.

542
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,738
No. No!

543
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,239
Get out of here.

544
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,535
Caitlin.

545
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,749
You were right.

546
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,421
He killed Ronnie.

547
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,548
Thank you.

548
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,262
I'm not leaving without him.

549
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,265
Barry, there's no time. There's no time!

550
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,434
I can't hold him forever.

551
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,562
All right. Hey, I'm coming back for you
when this is all over, all right?

552
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,105
- Go!
- I'm coming back.

553
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,615
Jay, we need to do something.

554
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,118
Our only chance is to reboot the
electromagnetic insulators

555
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,696
and hope the quark matter
redistributes equally.

556
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,705
- How we do that?
- We have to do it manually.

557
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,992
But you can't be near the stabilizer rings
when they power on

558
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,710
or you'll get sucked into the breach.

559
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,753
Not if I create a vortex
to counteract the pull.

560
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,456
You can't do both at the same time.

561
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,748
Cait.

562
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,210
I have to try.

563
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,678
I'll help you.

564
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,132
What? Dad, no.

565
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,300
Look, if it brings Barry back to this
Earth, I'm doing it.

566
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,719
- Are you sure?
- The more we talk about it,

567
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,512
the less sure I'll be,
so let'sjust do it.

568
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,813
Okay.

569
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,311
There's an override switch
on every stabilizer ring.

570
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,444
I'll create the vortex,
and you flip all of them.

571
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,941
- They should all reboot.
- Got it.

572
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,649
Once that's done, you power up the cannon.
The breach should stabilize.

573
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,941
And what if it doesn't?

574
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,822
We're all out of luck.

575
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,760
The Velocity-Nine is running out.

576
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,909
Jay.

577
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,535
I guess now we know
how long the Velocity-Nine lasts.

578
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,789
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,582
I just hope they are.

580
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,384
- Hey.
- I'm fine, I'm just a mess.

581
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,549
You guys need to get out of Central City,
all right?

582
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,889
Any place you think
you'll be safe from Zoom?

583
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,562
Yeah. We have some family in Atlantis
that can help us.

584
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,813
Yeah, okay, good.

585
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,145
You may not have been struck by lightning
over here like I was,

586
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,608
but today, you risked your life to save
somebody you didn't even know.

587
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,363
That's a hero, Barry.

588
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,406
Thank you, both.

589
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,746
Barry, is my father still alive
on your Earth?

590
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,582
Yeah, he is.

591
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,997
Give him a hug for me, will you?

592
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,079
I will.

593
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:02,098
Hey, you guys need to get someplace safe,
too. Where are you going?

594
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,308
The only place we can.

595
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,682
- Dad, we can't just leave.
- We have to, honey.

596
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,234
What? You want me to leave everything
I have here?

597
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,942
My friends, my family? I mean, my life?

598
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,606
You don't have a life here anymore.

599
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,117
Neither do I. Zoom is too powerful.
I can't stop him.

600
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,454
And as long as he is here,
he's gonna hunt us down.

601
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,456
Until we're dead.

602
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,669
Wells, if you're coming with us,
we have to go.

603
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,420
Come on. Come on.

604
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,211
It's almost time.

605
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,304
I don't care what time it is.

606
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:45,683
After all we did to stabilize this breach,
we're not closing it until they show up.

607
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,635
You all hear me?

608
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,107
Cisco!

609
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,652
Get ready to close the breach for good.
Zoom's coming.

610
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,825
Forgetting someone, Flash?

611
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,406
Let him go.

612
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,158
Close the breach.

613
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,370
Tell Jesse I love her.

614
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,749
Tell her yourself.

615
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,592
It shouldn't be taking this long.

616
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,224
Close it! Close it now!

617
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,347
You did it. You made it.

618
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,192
Barry.

619
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,699
No!

620
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:55,723
