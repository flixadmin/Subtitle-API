00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,460
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash
<i>and</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,913
Thanks, man, we're good.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,464
I'm leaving Central City.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,916
Every hero has their own journey.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,798
<i>If yours is taking you on a new path,
you owe it to yourself to go.</i>

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,839
<i>I watched the men murder you.</i>

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,469
Mother ran with Mari.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,845
She abandoned me.

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,177
I'm sorry, Kuasa.

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,059
<i>When Nora was possessed by Mallus,
he seemed scared of my totem.</i>

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,683
You're one of the six.

12
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,901
Maybe these totems are the keys
to stopping him.

13
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,400
I only know about five totems.
Could there be more?

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,698
That woman
clearly has a crush on you.

15
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,026
I thought that maybe if you'd
like to come to the ship...

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,406
There's no time.
Director Hunter has escaped.

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,035
Wally West, I need your help.

18
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,341
This way, lads.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,390
<i>Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest</i>

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,477
<i>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum</i>

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,485
This be the spot. Get to diggin'.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,032
Surely, ye don't mean for these men

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,076
to be knowin' where we
buried our treasure.

24
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,829
"Our treasure," my love?

25
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,370
Aye. Ours, and no one else's.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,328
No, no. Don't concern yourself
over a few doubloons.

27
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,165
I didn't show these sorry sea dogs

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,879
the most valuable trinket
in me possession.

29
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:42,934
An emerald fit for a pirate queen.

30
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,890
How do I look?

31
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,693
Annie?

32
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,492
Edward!

33
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,739
Take it off!

34
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,212
I don't know what I'm looking at.

35
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,843
Looks like a hemorrhoid.

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,007
What? No. It's Mallus.

37
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,431
Demon horns?

38
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,508
Anyway, the hunt for the six totems
has begun.

39
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,434
There are only five tribes in Zambesi.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,623
Each was gifted with a totem.

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,764
And I checked,
there's no record of a sixth.

42
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,521
Well, the good news is that we have
the Air and the Spirit Totems.

43
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,860
Kuasa has the Water Totem.

44
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,483
And since the final totem
is a complete mystery,

45
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,156
that leaves us looking for
Earth and Fire.

46
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,535
Now, the Fire Totem which is
currently smashed, BTW,

47
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,580
was last seen in Detroit Museum
in 2018.

48
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,747
Wait, how do you know that?

49
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,535
Because it is with
your granddaughter Mari's,

50
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,293
a.k.a. the other Vixen's, boyfriend,
Dr. Adam Macalester.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,629
He's dedicated his life to the study
of the Zambesi totems.

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,219
Well, if Constantine is right,

53
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,718
and the only thing that Mallus fears
is the six,

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,535
then we need to get our hands
on the Fire Totem.

55
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,720
Ah.

56
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,473
Collect the set, win a prize.

57
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,322
We need to tell Sara
we gotta get to Detroit.

58
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,348
Nope. She's off to Star City.

59
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,899
She's been texting some guy.
They're going on a date.

60
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,880
How do you know?
What, are you looking at her phone?

61
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,317
I look at everyone's phone.
Helps pass the time.

62
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,239
Well, who's she going on a date with?

63
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,942
- Obviously it's Ava.
- Oh, that's hot.

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,406
What's hot?

65
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,406
Uh... The Fire Totem. Hot, hot.

66
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,374
Very hot and currently in Detroit.
So what do you say

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,701
we motor off to the Motor City?

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,745
Right now?

69
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,417
Um...

70
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:41,219
I might sit this one out
because I have to do

71
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,837
business back home.

72
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,885
I bet you do.

73
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,069
Hi.

74
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,896
Wow.

75
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,611
- You look...
- Weird.

76
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,862
I look weird, right?

77
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,818
I was gonna say beautiful, but...

78
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,363
Thank you. So do you. It's... Wow.

79
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,711
Do you wanna...

80
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,297
Right.

81
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,750
Madam?

82
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,613
You know what, I'll just have
whatever she's having, please.

83
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,345
- Vodka martini. Extra dirty. Stirred.
- Of course.

84
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,468
Stirred, not shaken?

85
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,141
Shaken's for lightweights who like
their booze watered-down.

86
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,343
And James Bond.

87
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,975
James Bond never had to fight off
a horde of Vikings

88
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,056
or help me escape a demon realm.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,392
- True.
- Um...

90
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,606
How is work?

91
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,614
Work is... Ugh. This is awful.

92
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,095
You know what, I have an idea.

93
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,597
Let's just try to be normal
for one night.

94
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,034
No Legends, no Bureau.
What do you think?

95
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,476
- There you are.
- Thank you.

96
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,741
I feel like relationships

97
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,871
are complicated enough
without time travel

98
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,122
and supervillains, don't you?

99
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,329
Okay.

100
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,755
Then, here's to being two regular women
on a completely normal first date.

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,177
Completely normal.

102
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,143
Hey. You okay?

103
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,064
My granddaughter, the good one,
she's out there.

104
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,196
I wanna see her more than anything.

105
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,241
But you can't without
screwing up history.

106
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,530
Some days I wish I had never heard of
time travel.

107
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,660
Yeah.

108
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,021
Hmm. I like what you have done
with your hair.

109
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,082
Oh, really? I hate it.

110
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,921
- Good news.
- Bad news.

111
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,460
What's going on?

112
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,070
- I know where...
- Fire Totem's...

113
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,881
Ray-Ray, you go first.

114
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,799
We tried to steal the Fire Totem

115
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,881
from your granddaughter's boyfriend.

116
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,137
But someone beat us to it.

117
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,972
Damien Darhk.

118
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,942
You know, for a megalomaniac, he has
very lovely penmanship.

119
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,108
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,090
Oh, and by the way, don't worry,
Macalester's fine.

121
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,150
Can I talk now, please?

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,731
Yeah, you said you had good news.

123
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,987
I know where the Earth Totem is.

124
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,945
Or more precisely, when.

125
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,329
1717. <i>Saint Lisette.</i>

126
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,458
<i>Saint Lisette.</i> Sister ship of
<i>La Concorde.</i>

127
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,661
Get to the point, Pretty.

128
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,296
<i>La Concorde</i> was boarded by pirates

129
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,248
and later named
<i>Queen Anne's Revenge.</i>

130
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,751
It's Blackbeard the pirate's ship.

131
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,591
So Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

132
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,339
Well, let's steal it.

133
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,891
No. Guys, hold on. Sara is on a date.

134
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,934
We should probably avoid
messing with history

135
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,307
while she's still on appetizers.

136
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,434
But think how happy she'd be

137
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,016
if we had the Earth Totem by dessert.

138
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,227
<i>At this juncture,
the responsible thing to do</i>

139
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,903
<i>would be to consult Captain Lance.</i>

140
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,902
Who would tell us we can't risk
the Darhks getting another Totem.

141
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,327
All those in favor
of setting a course to 1717?

142
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,914
Aye.

143
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,618
Arr.

144
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,994
Aye!

145
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,916
- Aye.
- Ah!

146
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,594
How are we supposed to find
Blackbeard in this rabble?

147
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,509
Well, we could ask a pirate nicely.

148
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,183
"Nicely"? Ray, pirates are terrified
of Blackbeard.

149
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,478
- They're not gonna just offer us...
- So you looking for Blackbeard?

150
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,766
How do I know youse not spies
for the Royal Navy?

151
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,067
Because we wanna join
Blackbeard's crew, you germ.

152
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:43,912
It's, uh, rather a lovely place
you've traveled to, Mr. West.

153
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,039
How did you find me?

154
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,419
By tracking the geo-location of
your MP3 player.

155
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,094
Your playlist consists of a rather
amazing number of repetitions

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,921
of George Michael's <i>Careless Whisper.</i>

157
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,140
Jesse loved that song.

158
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,343
I assume that your recent heartbreak
is the reason

159
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,847
for your spiritual quest?

160
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,481
However, with the fate
of the world at stake,

161
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm afraid that you can no longer
sit idly by.

162
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,982
Uh, I'm sorry, my friend,
but my days of fafooming are over.

163
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,529
Right now, I'm living my life
one quarter-mile at a time.

164
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,488
Is that a Buddhist koan?

165
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,162
Dom Torreto. <i>The Fast and The Furious.</i>

166
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,539
Aren't you BFFs with the Legends?

167
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,241
I'm sure my boy Nate can help you out.

168
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,706
Uh, it seems that my days of Legending
are over.

169
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,842
Alas, you're quite secure
in your decision to slow things down.

170
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
I am.

171
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,055
Well, the last time I was this far east

172
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,633
was in the Opium War.

173
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,760
Be a shame to waste a trip.

174
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,021
Fancy a drink?

175
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,364
Another flagon of ale!

176
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,030
So this is where Blackbeard hangs out.

177
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,073
- Classy.
- Yep.

178
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,244
Line 'em up.

179
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,995
What's up?

180
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,705
Nothing.

181
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,546
I said, what's up?

182
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,091
Fine. You're an unbiased listener.

183
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,845
I want to change my granddaughter
Kuasa's past

184
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,471
and, well, improve her future.

185
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,096
So do it.

186
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,519
It's not that simple.

187
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,605
What if I inadvertently change
my other granddaughter's destiny?

188
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,270
So don't do it.

189
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,976
And then there's Nate.

190
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,022
I still have to go back to 1942
and marry someone else

191
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,402
so that Kuasa and Mari are even born.

192
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,525
We can never end up together.

193
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,578
I feel paralyzed.

194
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,996
Every step I take, it feels like

195
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,666
it could just have
disastrous consequences.

196
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,664
Take a look around.

197
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,418
You think these people give a damn
about consequences?

198
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,961
Take the night off.

199
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,301
A true pirate doesn't live for tomorrow,

200
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,382
they only live for the moment.

201
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,964
Thanks, Mick.

202
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,766
But I don't know the first thing
about acting like a pirate.

203
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,188
Well... I do.

204
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,931
<i>It was just Laurel and I.</i>

205
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,649
I was always the rebel,
and she was always the good one.

206
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,481
Why do you look like
you already know this, hmm?

207
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,940
What, did you google me?

208
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,366
No.

209
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,943
I may have read your file.

210
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,723
Back when you were a fugitive
from the Bureau,

211
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,183
and, look, I know that sounds stalker-y,

212
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,290
but in my defense,
I did not see this coming.

213
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,333
Well, what do you wanna know?

214
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,339
Okay. You always seem
so composed and cool,

215
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,170
but you can't be all cool all the time.

216
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,630
What's the most embarrassed
you've ever been?

217
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,715
That's an easy one.

218
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,780
First time I ever had a weapon
in my hand.

219
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,008
- Lian Yu?
- Nope.

220
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,261
Starling City Elementary.

221
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,558
I was Peter Pan in the school play.

222
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,516
I got up on stage for the first
scene and I just totally froze,

223
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,296
I couldn't remember any of my lines.
It was like my mind just went blank.

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,440
What did you do?

225
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,196
Well, I broke out into a tap dance
of course,

226
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,572
and then I ran off-stage crying.

227
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,698
You can dance?

228
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,865
Go ahead. You can check it.

229
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,084
I'm sure it's nothing. It's just...

230
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,170
- It's a voicemail. I'm just gonna...
- It's okay.

231
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,694
<i>It wasn't my idea, but the team
has taken the</i> Waverider

232
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,586
<i>on a joyride to the Bahamas, 1717,</i>

233
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,137
<i>in a futile attempt to locate
the missing Earth Totem.</i>

234
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,010
<i>Just thought you should know.</i>

235
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,973
Is everything okay?

236
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah, totally fine.

237
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,515
- Normal, in fact.
- Hmm.

238
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,828
The Captain wants to see you.

239
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,247
Oh, man, Sara's here?

240
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,949
Not that one, you dumbass.

241
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,996
I'm talking about the most fearsome
pirate queen to sail the seven seas.

242
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,997
The Dread Pirate Jiwe.

243
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,511
- She needs to loosen up.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,548
I heard she once cut out a man's tongue

245
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,349
for not obeying her orders.

246
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,269
Yeah, and she still carries it
to this day.

247
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,687
I never heard of no lady pirate.

248
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,687
That's because dead men tell no tales.

249
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,734
Aye.

250
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,191
They say she lost her ship to a kraken

251
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,900
and in retribution, she hunted
down the monster's wee bairn

252
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,901
and ate the gupper raw.

253
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,612
I heard she was spat back outta hell
by the devil himself.

254
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:35,499
Hmm. I hear she be more bold
and fearless than Captain Blackbeard.

255
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,550
Beggin' your pardon, Captain.

256
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,838
What was that ye said?

257
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,381
I have it under good authority

258
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,769
we be in the company
of the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

259
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,108
Why's everyone
staring at me?

260
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,313
Because one thing pirates love
more than treasure is a good story.

261
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,406
Blackbeard. He's heading this way.

262
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,738
- Hit me.
- What?

263
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,496
The mission is yours. Have fun
getting the Earth Totem back. Hit me.

264
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,418
Now, get out of my sight before
I really lose my temper.

265
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,515
So you're the Dread Pirate Jiwe, eh?

266
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,981
Welcome to Nassau.

267
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,052
Rory, Amaya, come in. Over.

268
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,013
Some sort of interference
with the communication system.

269
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,323
Guys, answer me. Over.

270
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,076
Hey, calm down. I'm sure they're okay.

271
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,643
<i>My apologies,
but I'm experiencing</i>

272
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,158
<i>a Level 4 systems failure.</i>

273
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,959
Wasn't me. Nothing to do with it.

274
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,086
<i>I believe the fault lies
in our present coordinates.</i>

275
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,836
<i>You did park me in the middle
of the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

276
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,050
Sailors call it "the Devil's Triangle."

277
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,179
No, the stories of ships disappearing
are grossly exaggerated.

278
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,299
Um...

279
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,972
You sure about that, Ray?

280
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,599
The scuttlebutt is you're wanting
to join me crew.

281
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,148
The Dread Pirate Jiwe works for no man.

282
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,020
What we seek is treasure.

283
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:31,327
As does every pirate
worth his or her salt.

284
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,372
You know, I believe that you have
this particular treasure

285
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,699
in your possession.

286
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,499
It's a necklace with
a very large emerald.

287
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,003
That description doesn't strike a chord.

288
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,542
Let me jog your memory.

289
00:14:55,144 --> 00:15:00,435
A couple of pirates
after me own cold, black heart.

290
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,442
I'll tell you where the trinket is.

291
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,729
But at a price.

292
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,950
I'm here for the pirate
known as Blackbeard.

293
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,664
I expect you'll be wanting to see
me letter of marque?

294
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,001
A forgery, no doubt.
Your letter will win no favor with me.

295
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,169
I wouldn't so much as breathe
if I were you.

296
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,971
Good evening, Miss Jiwe.

297
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,144
They say the third time is a charm.

298
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,772
But this charm is the third.

299
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,235
No.

300
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,039
I must commend you, Lieutenant Maynard,

301
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,834
for leading us straight to Blackbeard
and his associates.

302
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,503
- You're most welcome, Admiral.
- "Admiral"?

303
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,422
I know, right? I look so handsome.

304
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,374
And I'll be made Commodore

305
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,837
once Blackbeard's severed head
swings from my ship's bowsprit.

306
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,967
You know, the last kingsman
who threatened me

307
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,410
ended up begging for his own life.

308
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,925
Gentlemen, please.

309
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,220
You may continue all threats
and counter-threats

310
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,476
as soon as I get what I need.

311
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,686
The emerald necklace.

312
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,108
Where is it?

313
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,108
That's Blackbeard you're talking to,
and he ain't gonna say...

314
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,198
I buried it on Grace Island.
Would you like me to draw you a map?

315
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,275
I can't promise to make it to scale,

316
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,281
but, um, I could do me damnedest.

317
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,911
You heard the man.

318
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,460
Let's have another drink.

319
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,583
Oh.

320
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,789
Appears to be empty.

321
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,958
Gimme some of that.

322
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,964
No, this, this is not for you.

323
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,888
Please. I drank Hemingway
and Van Gogh under the table.

324
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,636
Cisco gave this to me
before I left Central City.

325
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,637
The only way a speedster can get
drunk is off of this rocket fuel.

326
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,350
- Rocket fuel.
- Yeah.

327
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,900
Uh... Oh.

328
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,487
Mmm!

329
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,279
- Cisco's a ruddy genius.
- Yeah, he is.

330
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,319
So is Barry and Caitlin and Wells.

331
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,698
Wait, maybe that's why I never fit
on Team Flash.

332
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,418
And here I was, thinking you were
roaming the Chinese countryside

333
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,587
because your girlfriend
needed more space.

334
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,124
Look, I can do one better
than that, mate.

335
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,001
Both of my favorite protégés

336
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,178
conspired to have me put in prison.

337
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,682
- What happened?
- Well, I lied to Sara

338
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,182
in addition to accidentally aiding in
the resurrection of the man

339
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,479
who killed her sister.

340
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:52,062
And Ava is angry at me for sending
good agents to their deaths.

341
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,312
Whoa...

342
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,399
It sounds like you're a bit of a douche.
No offense.

343
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,028
No, none taken, I...

344
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,902
I intend to make it up to both of them,

345
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:04,081
but first I need the teensiest,
teensiest of favors.

346
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,793
Hey, Agent McNeil, just calling
to say congrats

347
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,540
on being named Agent of the Month.

348
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,293
The Bureau's lucky to have you.

349
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,884
I'm coming for you, McNeil.

350
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,722
Hello?

351
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,220
Who's there?

352
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,731
Not again.

353
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,401
This is way more fun than meditating.

354
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,697
I know.

355
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,034
Right, there is one item we must procure

356
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,656
from the Bureau storage closet

357
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,161
and one that is very near and dear
to my heart.

358
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,460
Oh.

359
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,550
<i>We're screwed.</i>

360
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,423
The ship's electrical systems
are experiencing

361
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,424
multiple unexplained malfunctions.

362
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,630
It's the Devil's Triangle.

363
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,760
Look, that's just a myth.

364
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,453
Whatever it is, we need to time jump
out of here.

365
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,061
What? And leave Mick and Amaya
stranded in pirate times?

366
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,104
It's a miracle we're still in the air.

367
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,733
Well, I'm sure they're having
a whale of a time with Blackbeard.

368
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,596
What's so funny about getting
your head chopped off?

369
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,407
Mmm. There are worse ends.

370
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,407
Like the one I brought on
that fool admiral.

371
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,451
That necklace is cursed.

372
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,792
I saw its dastardly work
with me own eyes.

373
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,749
Get your hands off me, you blaggards.

374
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,503
I'm so sorry, Mick.

375
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,055
If I really was the Dread Pirate Jiwe,

376
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,827
I never would have let Darhk
steal my totem.

377
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,344
The hell you apologizing for?
You're better than the story.

378
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,307
And a hell of a lot more fearsome
than some pirate queen,

379
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,475
with or without your totem.

380
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,444
This man, Edward Teach,

381
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,821
has been convicted of unlawful piracy
and plunder.

382
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,782
Therefore, it is my duty
as an instrument of the Crown to...

383
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,077
- Watch out!
- Aye!

384
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,970
You're in sore need of a sword, pirate.

385
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,999
Gideon, maybe you can help us
settle an argument.

386
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,731
What are the chances of survival
if we stay in the Bermuda Triangle?

387
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,796
<i>Zero. There are multiple
cannonballs headed towards</i>

388
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,686
<i>our starboard bow as we speak.</i>

389
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,021
Um, sorry, "cannonballs"?

390
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,401
I thought we were cloaked.

391
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,734
<i>I tried to tell you coming here
was a bad idea.</i>

392
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,044
Who the heck's firing at us?

393
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,877
I want that ship brought down.
Fire another volley!

394
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,970
Aye, sir!

395
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,393
You wouldn't kill an unarmed man.

396
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,115
You're showing him mercy?

397
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,363
Shut up! We just saved your hairy neck.

398
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,160
Try to keep up, boys.

399
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,375
Gideon, jump us out of here!

400
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,376
My heart is pounding,
my palms are sweaty

401
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,490
and I know that I only have
a few rounds left in my pocket.

402
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,800
So what did you do?

403
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,847
I grabbed a guy and used him
as a human shield.

404
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,059
And from that point on,

405
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,681
no one would ever play paintball
with me ever again.

406
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,354
Well, it sounds like
a hell of a 15th birthday party.

407
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,272
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,397
- You okay?
- I'm gonna run to the restroom.

409
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,525
Really quickly... I'm sorry.

410
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,667
We're gonna need the check.

411
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,171
Please tell me that the <i>Waverider</i>
did not just crash into Star City.

412
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,343
Star City? Is that where we are?

413
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,095
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

414
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,677
Well, the good news is the cannonball
didn't hit the time core.

415
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,230
And Nate made a beautiful landing.

416
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,399
Yeah. Thanks, big guy.

417
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,360
So, Sara, how's the date going?

418
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,355
It's over.

419
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,321
Come here. Come here.
What the hell are you doing here?

420
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,074
Please don't be mad.
You weren't answering your phone.

421
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,200
This better be
a life-or-death emergency, Gary.

422
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,117
Worse. A speedster stole
my Time Courier.

423
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,494
And then pantsed me.

424
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,749
And then...

425
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,956
- Did you check if HQ is secure?
- Snug as a bug.

426
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,295
Except one item was reported
missing from storage.

427
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,302
A long, brown coat that
used to belong to, uh...

428
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,679
- Rip Hunter.
- Yeah.

429
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,353
- Okay.
- You look great, by the way.

430
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,002
Shut up, Gary. Remember, we talked
about personal space.

431
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,562
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.

432
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,280
Ouch.

433
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,983
Double ouch.

434
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,917
- You want me to box it up for you?
- No, Gary.

435
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,161
Okay, we need to find Rip.

436
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,558
He's got a Time Courier, which means

437
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,950
he could be anywhere, any time,
causing a whole mess of problems.

438
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,754
<i>Time can never mend</i>

439
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,544
<i>The careless whisper</i>

440
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,888
<i>Of a good friend</i>

441
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,387
<i>To the heart and mind</i>

442
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,185
<i>Ignorance is blind</i>

443
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,139
<i>There's no comfort in the truth</i>

444
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,309
<i>Pain is all you'll find</i>

445
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,853
<i>I'm never gonna dance again</i>

446
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,906
<i>Guilty feet ain't got no rhythm</i>

447
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,491
<i>Though it's easy to pretend</i>

448
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,818
<i>I know you're not a fool</i>

449
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,704
When I left, you were headed to Detroit.

450
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,448
Yeah, it's a... It's a really...
It's a really long story.

451
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,913
Mick and Amaya are marooned in 1717.

452
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,121
The Darhks have the Fire Totem
and Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

453
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,457
That's... I thought it was gonna be
a longer story.

454
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,257
Thank God you're back. You look great.

455
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,882
The engine room's a disaster.
We're not going anywhere.

456
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,451
I don't know who looks more ridiculous,

457
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,391
you guys in your pirate britches
or me in this stupid dress.

458
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Definitely them.

459
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,935
Hey, I know it looks like a mess,

460
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,694
but we really wanted you to have
a nice night out.

461
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,819
Yeah, if you really like that
mean Time Bureau lady,

462
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,007
you shouldn't give up on her.

463
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,148
Look, I'm not giving up on anything

464
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,602
other than maybe the idea
that I'll ever have a normal life.

465
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,410
Zari, get the ship back
in fighting shape

466
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,990
because until then,
Rory and Amaya are on their own.

467
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,668
All right, listen up.

468
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,001
We can't let the Darhks beat us to
Grace Island and to the Earth Totem,

469
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,720
so we're in need of a ship.

470
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,138
You want to sail
the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge?</i>

471
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,554
I told you that necklace is cursed.

472
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,605
What?

473
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,649
You're gonna let a curse stop you
from taking the gold?

474
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,319
Aye.

475
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,522
Why did you become a pirate
in the first place, eh?

476
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,427
- Well...
- To let an admiral get the best of you

477
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,695
or to claim your destiny
on the wide open sea?

478
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,826
I don't know what's waiting for us on
the other side of this journey,

479
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,916
but whatever it is,

480
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,913
it beats cowering in some alleyway

481
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,211
waiting for your black beard
to turn gray.

482
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,124
I swore I'd never go back
to that island.

483
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,835
And I'm a man of me word.

484
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,216
Fair winds, my hearties.

485
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:02,092
- Blackbeard's a coward.
- Look alive, men. Shoot on sight!

486
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,766
Come on, keep moving.

487
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,813
We don't need Blackbeard.

488
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,857
We just need his ship.

489
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,565
Ah, another drink?

490
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,696
Listen up!

491
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,500
The Dread Pirate Jiwe
is looking for a crew.

492
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,005
Your old captain, Blackbeard,

493
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,709
buried his treasure on Grace Island.

494
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,045
Ah.

495
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:42,758
So you've heard the rumors then,
that the treasure is cursed?

496
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,182
But while old Blackbeard is afraid
of his own shadow,

497
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,054
you men,

498
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,059
you vile and despicable men,

499
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:57,739
are willing to face Davy Jones himself
for a crack at gold and glory!

500
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,199
Who's willing to join me

501
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,618
as we take over Blackbeard's ship?

502
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,697
Mutiny!

503
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,408
Is that what this is, eh?

504
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,455
You'd rather follow
the Dread Pirate Jiwe

505
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,881
than your own captain?

506
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,009
Then I'm bloody joining you.

507
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,182
I'll dig up me chest

508
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,848
and share the spoils with ye men.

509
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,603
Hats off to the pirate queen!

510
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,965
- All hands on deck!
- Aye, sir!

511
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,548
Secure the backstays and hoist
the Jolly Roger high.

512
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,680
There's land ahead.

513
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,805
Sara!

514
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,473
Yeah. What now?

515
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,142
We have another anachronism in 1717.

516
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:20,105
The <i>HMS Fortitude</i> got into
a naval battle with Blackbeard's ship

517
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,301
off the coast of Grace Island.

518
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,486
So?

519
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,115
So that is a portrait of their Admiral.

520
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,655
Ugh. Damien Darhk.

521
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,868
I don't care if Zari has to duct-tape
the <i>Waverider</i> back together,

522
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,202
we have to get it in the air.

523
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,084
<i>Well, I wouldn't advise
returning to the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

524
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,258
It's "the Devil's Triangle,"
and Mick and Amaya are in danger.

525
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,046
Ava! Hey!

526
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,473
Don't "Hi, Ava" me.
You stood me up, jerk.

527
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,138
Awkward.

528
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,475
Blackbeard draws
one hell of a map.

529
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,473
Dig.

530
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,984
Oh! Blast!
I've left me compass on the ship.

531
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,319
It's a family heirloom...

532
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,574
Turn back and I'll kill you.

533
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,242
What aren't you telling us, eh?

534
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:19,381
Well, in me haste, I may have
left out some minuscule details

535
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,298
about the cursed necklace.

536
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,508
<i>I gifted it to me love and queen,</i>

537
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,055
<i>the most devious,</i>

538
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,509
dastardly woman I've ever
had the pleasure of meeting.

539
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,312
Apart from you, I mean.

540
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,897
<i>But as soon as Annie put it on,</i>

541
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,854
<i>something dark and unholy overtook her.</i>

542
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,655
Totems draw on the life force
of their bearer.

543
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,858
So if Anne was as wicked as you suggest,

544
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,823
the totem would have only amplified
her worst impulses.

545
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,451
It turned her into a monster.

546
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,374
<i>How did you live to tell the tale?</i>

547
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,419
<i>Well, I did the only
decent thing any man would do.</i>

548
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,598
I put a musket ball in her head and
buried her along with the treasure.

549
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:08,013
That cursed necklace won't let her
rest in peace.

550
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,807
<i>Me Annie will rise again.</i>

551
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,852
Stiffen your backbones, men.

552
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,215
I gotta hand it to you,
Miss Lance,

553
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,342
you take the phrase "Dine and dash"
to a whole new level.

554
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,404
Look, the <i>Waverider</i> fell out of
the sky. My team needed help.

555
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,698
Why does that
not surprise me?

556
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,575
Should we interrupt?

557
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,115
No.

558
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,870
But Ava gave me an idea.

559
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,035
Her Time Courier.

560
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,712
I'm coming with you. But first I have
to get the nanite pistol.

561
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,089
No, Ray! Don't!

562
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,229
Steady.

563
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,187
Well, hello, Annie.

564
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,812
It's good to see you're, uh...

565
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,365
You're looking so beautiful.

566
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,820
You know this was never gonna work out.

567
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,258
Really? Because I'm a mature person
who actually can communicate?

568
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,635
Oh, really? Such a communicator!

569
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,717
Like when you said
you were going to the bathroom?

570
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,720
- What are you talking about?
- You think I didn't see Gary?

571
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,188
Oh, my... Rip broke into
the Time Bureau.

572
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,835
I was coming back to the table
to tell you.

573
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,170
- You know what, this is pointless.
- Yeah, it is.

574
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,547
We should have never tried to be normal.
I'm not normal, all right?

575
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,133
I'm never gonna be normal. And I'm
not gonna be normal for anyone.

576
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,568
I don't want you to be normal.

577
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,823
- You don't?
- Hell no.

578
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,467
- What?
- The kiss was great. It's just...

579
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:21,100
We claim this ship and ye two women
as ours.

580
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,430
Come on.

581
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,017
Hey.

582
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,193
Let's do this.

583
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,245
Come on, ye namby-pamby.
They're only lassies.

584
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,130
Listen to me.

585
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,209
That totem can burden
even one born to wear it.

586
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,006
I know it must feel like a noose
around your neck.

587
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,510
Let me help you break free
of this curse.

588
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,228
Thank you for distracting her.

589
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,288
Unfortunately, now I have to kill you.

590
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,916
Surprisingly powerful.

591
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,100
Well, that was fun.

592
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,973
But playtime is over.

593
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,519
Hey, you guys!

594
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,107
- I want my totem back.
- Ah, you fool.

595
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,154
We don't need swords to kill you.

596
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,541
No!

597
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,244
Good shot, Haircut.

598
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,344
No! No!

599
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,176
Stay with me.

600
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,551
Stay with me, sweetheart. Come on.

601
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,722
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me.

602
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,354
Come on. Let's go.

603
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,774
Don't let her... Come on.

604
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,032
That was too easy.

605
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,661
You two bonny lasses be
the best fighters I've e'er seen.

606
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,166
How would you like to join me crew?

607
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,421
Ah.

608
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,841
The <i>Waverider,</i> eh?

609
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,722
She's a... An unusual ship.

610
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,141
But I can think of no more
appropriate vessel

611
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,022
for the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

612
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:19,449
Thanks for saving my life
and for stopping your bonny mates

613
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,991
from keelhaulin' me.

614
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,615
Well, thank you for leading me
to the accursed treasure.

615
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,244
And make sure you tell them
that Captain Jiwe spared you.

616
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,081
Absolutely, of course, I...

617
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,673
Fair winds, Captain Jiwe.

618
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,850
Amaya, I am, uh... I'm so sorry.

619
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,903
If I didn't push everybody to go
after the Earth Totem,

620
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,651
you wouldn't have lost yours.

621
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,031
It's all right, Nathaniel.

622
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,409
We'll fix this.
We'll get your totem back.

623
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,618
My birthright, it's always dictated
the path I choose.

624
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,791
It's like a compass
that just points the way.

625
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,244
It must be so difficult not to have it.

626
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,083
It's also freeing.

627
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,625
For the first time in my life,
I get to decide.

628
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,884
Amaya.

629
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,591
You know, I learned something
from hanging out with pirates.

630
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,103
They always focus on the problem
in front of them.

631
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,064
And what is that problem?

632
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,486
Do you yield, sir?

633
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,328
Aye, Captain.

634
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,513
Rum floats
were a very good idea.

635
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,625
It only seemed fair
since we missed dessert.

636
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,305
Ha.

637
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,428
What?

638
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,051
Sometimes we screw things up
for the better.

639
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,096
I will drink to that.

640
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,891
Cheers.

641
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,061
Ah. It's good.

642
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,398
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about bailing on you earlier.

643
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,610
I should have been honest with you
about what was going on with my team.

644
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,704
No. No, no, no.

645
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,493
I should have never put the kibosh
on talking shop.

646
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,918
- You're right, it's your fault.
- You... Oh, man.

647
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,048
Besides, I'd rather fight pirates
with you any day

648
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,040
than sit in some stupid restaurant.

649
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,508
Well, in that case,

650
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,133
I was thinking Genghis Khan
for our second date.

651
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,429
Done.

652
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,534
But only if I can call you "Peter Pan."

653
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,684
- Don't. Don't.
- Miss...

654
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,934
Okay.

655
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,895
So you got a room on this ship or...

656
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,106
Let's go find out.

657
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,030
Why do you look so chipper?

658
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,455
Oh, no, I had a terrible hangover.
It lasted three minutes.

659
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,628
Mmm. The benefits
of a speedster's metabolism.

660
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,001
Here, take these.

661
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,338
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

662
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,421
You know, last night was pretty fun.

663
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,216
- Yeah.
- It got a bit lonely here, I think.

664
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,182
Yeah, I've been a bit lonely too.

665
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,514
Hey, your girlfriend dumped you,
your team treat you like an outcast.

666
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,816
It's no wonder you're on walkabout,

667
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:45,146
but the world needs Wallace West
to step in from the cold.

668
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,951
And I know a place where outcasts
fit right in.

669
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,330
In fact, some might say
that they've become Legends.

670
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,919
- Care to join me?
- What?

671
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,668
Is <i>Careless Whisper</i> not the best
karaoke song of all time?

672
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,853
It is the way we sing it, mate.

673
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,430
Haircut, want a beer?

674
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,974
Everyone's off doing their own thing.

675
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,227
Just you and me.

676
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,471
Sure. I could use a beer.

677
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:21,057
Even if I am
your last choice of companion.

678
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,824
Oh, that. Just doing a bit
of light theorizing.

679
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,487
And then I had a breakthrough.

680
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,662
I'm going to develop a liquid for
the perfect dry-erase marker.

681
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,080
Strong viscosity, clean lines...

682
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,782
You're a terrible liar.

683
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,288
Yeah.

684
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,503
It's Nora.

685
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,999
The nanite pistol's gonna kill her.

686
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,583
Uh...

687
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,886
That's what it's supposed to do,
but now I feel...

688
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,926
- Like a badass.
- No.

689
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,307
Guilty.

690
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,850
What?

691
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,307
- You saved Amaya.
- I know.

692
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,354
Doesn't really make sense,
except that I met her as a kid.

693
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,480
Well, now, she's all grown up
and joined the demon side.

694
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,443
Yeah.

695
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,490
But you, you have changed
since I first met you.

696
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,579
And I hate to break it to you, Mick,

697
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,580
but you are a much better person.

698
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,755
And maybe Nora
could have become one too.

699
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,257
There was hope for her anyway
before I took it away.

700
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,880
Come on, sweetheart, you gotta fight.
Stay with me. Come on.

701
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,726
Look, I know I'm the last person
you wanna see.

702
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,731
What did you do to my daughter?

703
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,729
Nothing that can't be undone.

704
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,741
I have a cure.

705
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,157
You and your great big heart.

706
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,075
You just couldn't handle the guilt,
could you?

707
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,362
I've come for a trade.

708
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,040
Amaya's totem, and I will save Nora.

709
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,275
I honestly thought that would be harder.

710
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,165
My daughter is all that matters.

711
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,883
Come on.

712
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,929
Steady.

713
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,057
That's it.

714
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,359
Ray.

715
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,939
You remember me?

716
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,490
Yes.

717
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,995
Darling. Wait.

718
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,876
He may be of value.

719
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,383
Welcome back.
