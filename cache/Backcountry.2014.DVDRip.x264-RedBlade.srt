1
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:39,115
(eerie music)

2
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,659
(flies buzzing)

3
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,805
(bell rings)

4
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,627
(blastoff noise)

5
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,097
- You ready?
- Okay.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,773
(radio chatter)

7
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,462
(rock music)

8
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,688
How am I doing?

9
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,259
You sure you wanna know?

10
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,838
Does your boyfriend
always get his way?

11
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,338
Yes.

12
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,307
Does he admit when he's wrong?

13
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,268
Never.

14
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,548
Does your boyfriend know how
to build a fire with no matches?

15
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,275
The answer is D, who cares.

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,420
A, yes, very well.

17
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,154
Sorry, that question's not on here.

18
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,210
(Alex): It should be.

19
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,781
Sorry, so you're still at zero.

20
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,189
(laughing)

21
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,276
- Noooo!
- Oh yeah!

22
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,940
# Never put your hat on the bed, son

23
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,921
# Never put your hat on the bed

24
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,477
# 'Cause if your hat's on the bed

25
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,645
# You might wake up dead

26
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,819
# So don't you ever
put your hat on the bed

27
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,816
# Always keep an edge on your knife, son

28
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,854
# Always keep an edge on your knife

29
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,588
# 'Cause a good sharp
edge is a man's best hedge

30
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,694
# Against the big uncertainties of life

31
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,493
# Yes a good sharp edge
is a man's best hedge

32
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,428
# Against the uncertain varities of life

33
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,596
Put your hands on the wheel!

34
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,531
# (mumble) sharp an old knife

35
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,900
# Like the ones who give the advice

36
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,474
# Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-ee, yodel-oo

37
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,350
# Never sell the old .22 #

38
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,713
(dramatic sting)

39
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:39,786
(ominous music)

40
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,726
-(Man): Hello?
- Hey!

41
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,354
(Man): Just give me
a second, will you?

42
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,527
Yeah, sure.

43
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,003
- How you doing?
- (Alex): Good, good, good.

44
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,995
We're reserved.
Under Louis.

45
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,364
- (Ranger): What's the name?
- Alex Louis.

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,842
(Ranger): Yeah,
I saw you in here.

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,835
You're ready to go,

48
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,912
your canoe will be right
down there by the water.

49
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,378
Bring it back Monday at five.

50
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,983
That's rig ht,
back to work Tuesday.

51
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,385
- Need a map?
- (Alex): No, I'm good.

52
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,983
You don't want a map?

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,753
Nope, no,
I know this park well.

54
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,724
It's kind of end of
the season, right?

55
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,919
I mean, the weather
can change on you.

56
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,420
Just turn on a dime.

57
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,965
- Less people.
-Amen to that.

58
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,268
You mind me asking you, Mr.
No Map, where you're headed?

59
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,561
Blackfoot Trail.

60
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,035
I can't wait to show her.

61
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,841
First time here,
it's gonna be awesome.

62
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,865
I got some bad news for you,

63
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,466
I'm really sorry about
this, but Blackfoot Trail's

64
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,707
closed for the season.

65
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:03,802
Why?

66
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,539
Had to, there were some
yahoos tramping around

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,940
there and
disrespecting everything,

68
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,784
This is a treasured site.

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,911
I don't have to tell you,
I guess,

70
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,858
and Parks and Recreation
wanna keep it that way.

71
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,355
Going to Blackfoot Trail is kind
of the whole point of this trip.

72
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,424
It's 500 bucks if you're
caught up there, each.

73
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,430
So that'd be a thousand bucks,
expensive little camping trip.

74
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,504
Honey!

75
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,374
Jenn, you ready?

76
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,302
- Yup.
- Oh, hang on.

77
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,767
Yeah rodeo,
there's your medical kit

78
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,702
and there's a whistle in there.

79
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,869
Try to bring that back

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,611
and I'll try not to charge you.

81
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,040
A thousand bucks?

82
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,607
(laughs)

83
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,746
(Ranger): You're pretty good!

84
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,955
Bye.

85
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,547
You have a nice trip.

86
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,720
<i>(Jenny. Thanks.</i>

87
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,476
- Really?
- Last one.

88
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,605
Come on, babe.

89
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
No, this is really important,

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,973
you knowl've been
waiting forever for this.

91
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,079
I'm just, just give me...

92
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,848
They're all important.

93
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,421
Can't it wait 'til we get back?

94
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,595
Okay, I'm done, good?

95
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,355
All right,
I don't believe you, but--

96
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,486
Well, putting it away, so--

97
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,557
Oh hang on, hang on.

98
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,530
Let's take a picture,
let's mark the departure.

99
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,501
Put it to good use, right?

100
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,995
Okay.

101
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,096
Ready?

102
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,534
(mumbles)

103
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,980
Yeah, one of us looks good.

104
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,381
All right.

105
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:11,131
(dramatic music)

106
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,210
- Hey.
- Hey, have a good one!

107
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,622
(Alex): Thanks a lot.

108
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,220
(9 runts)

109
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,232
- Fuck!
-You okay?

110
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,603
Fuck, fuck, that
fucking hurt like a bitch!

111
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,198
(Jenn): You sure you're okay?

112
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,040
Yeah, yeah,
I'll just walk it off.

113
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,072
This is for you.

114
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,042
It'll scare anything away.

115
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,806
You'll see.

116
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,046
Probably won't need it.

117
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,221
Got it taken care of already.

118
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,220
Look what I got.

119
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:12,951
When did you get that?

120
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,192
I got it a few days ago.

121
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,726
We're not gonna need it.

122
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,955
Do you wanna have a good time

123
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,823
on this trip, or do you want
me to be freaking out?

124
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,991
This is what makes me feel safe.

125
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,062
Okay.

126
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,995
Well if you're gonna have it,

127
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,907
it's useless in your bag,
give it to me.

128
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,641
Just gotta clip it to
your belt, all right?

129
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,977
You're not gonna need it.

130
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,576
Bear spray.

131
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,776
I wonder what other
goodies you have in there.

132
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,110
Nothing, I'm serious, I don't

133
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,111
have anything in there.

134
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,182
See, there's nothing.

135
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,919
Oh, come on!

136
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,689
Seriously?

137
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,687
This is a road flare--

138
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,654
I know what it is!

139
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,122
Yeah, this is for when
your car breaks down

140
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,329
on the side of the highway.

141
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,694
You know this,
I know you know this.

142
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,795
Jenn, come on,
if you wanted a flare

143
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,929
I could've picked
you up a pen flare,

144
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,603
they sell them at
any camping store.

145
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,748
- There's your flare.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,373
You ready?

147
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,717
I think so.

148
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,046
Okay.

149
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,285
(grunts) Oh my God.

150
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,925
- (Alex): You good?
-Yes.

151
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,958
- Huh?
- What, sorry, what?

152
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,850
Jenn, you know we'll be lucky to

153
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,353
see anything bigger
than a chipmunk, right?

154
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,054
Mmmhm.

155
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,994
(dramatic music)

156
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,817
- Hi.
- Hey.

157
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,914
(scoffs) No!

158
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,316
Hey look at that, that's cute.

159
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,056
We should take it.

160
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,859
- This a good spot?
-Yeah.

161
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,228
Counselor, back up.

162
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,421
(laughs)

163
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,474
Do you wanna turn
me on right now?

164
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,046
- Is it working?
-Yeah.

165
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,277
It's pretty hot.

166
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,913
Speaking of...

167
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,194
Do you remember the little
swimming hole we walked by?

168
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,386
Nope, I don't.

169
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,491
Really?

170
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,858
You said you would.

171
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,859
(Jenn): I didn't say that.

172
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,360
- Yes, you did.
- No, I said maybe.

173
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,341
No, no, no,
you said yes.

174
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,430
Come on, babes.

175
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,799
No, it's like when you
say "Do you wanna

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,168
order Chinese food
tonight?" and I go "Maybe,"

177
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,739
and then we get Italian.

178
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,507
I'm gonna be all
lonely by myself.

179
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,181
(Jenn): Well no one's
making you do this!

180
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,378
Stop <i>m</i>

181
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,189
Oh my God, please,
what is this?!

182
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,157
Don't leave me hanging, babe.

183
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,766
(laughs)

184
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,231
Okay, okay, fine.

185
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,814
- You ready?
- No.

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,045
Come on.

187
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,062
Five, four, three-two-one!

188
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,931
(screaming)

189
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,193
woo,

190
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,397
- (Alex): Come on!
-(Jenn): No!

191
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,303
Woo, woo!

192
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,875
I'm gonna get some more wood
before it gets too dark.

193
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,076
Okay, I'll come help you.

194
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,420
No, no,
I'll be back in a sec.

195
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,224
Okay. Yup-

196
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,020
(bird squawking)

197
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,427
- Hello?
-Whoa!

198
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,261
(indistinct conversation)

199
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,097
(Jenn): Yeah, so it was deep.

200
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,506
(Brad): Huh,
that's weird, I don't, I...

201
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,099
It must have been on the...

202
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,401
(indistinct)

203
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,036
(Jenn): No, I don't think so.

204
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,137
(Brad): I got the bee.

205
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,173
(Jenn): That's a
really weird story.

206
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,441
(Brad): I did,
the honeycomb's enough.

207
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,614
(Jenn): No, I know you didn't...

208
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,611
Hey.

209
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,558
This is Alex.
Alex, this is Brad.

210
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,614
Brad, rig ht?

211
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,185
Yeah, hi, how are you?

212
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,656
I'm good, thanks.

213
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,527
Were you just walking by, or...

214
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,121
Oh, yeah,
I was coming up the trail

215
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,328
and ran into your
friend here and

216
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,590
she invited me up for a chat.

217
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,193
Yeah, turns out that
he also grew up

218
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,429
in the park, or the woods,
and he's got

219
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,097
a ton of fish,
so I thought maybe

220
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,475
we could all have
dinner tonight.

221
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,334
Couldn't eat them
all if I wanted to.

222
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,008
I mean I could try, but...

223
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,482
I just gotta put
a shin on, all right?

224
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,709
(Jenn): All right.

225
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,042
(Brad): So you were saying?

226
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,353
(muffled chatting)

227
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,518
- Jenn!
-Yeah?

228
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,753
Could you come help
me here for a sec?

229
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,732
Sure.

230
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,069
- What's up?
- Come on in.

231
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,272
Okay.

232
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,269
What?

233
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,008
You comfortable with this?

234
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,436
What, him?

235
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,338
Yeah, I don't know,
this guy could be...

236
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,478
I was talking to him for like
10 minutes, he's great.

237
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,246
He's great, hmm,
well he's a liar.

238
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,711
Why is he a liar?

239
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,579
Woods?

240
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,646
What, the woods of Ireland?

241
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,081
- Come on, come on.
- What's that have to

242
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,288
do with anything?

243
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,053
Did you invite him or
did he invite himself?

244
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,124
I did.

245
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,692
You want me to uninvite him?

246
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,793
No, we can't do that, can we?

247
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,061
I can do that, I can
do that, it'd be really

248
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:10,795
awkward, but I'll do it.

249
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,173
You'd never be able to do that.

250
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,166
What do you need help with?

251
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,501
I obviously don't need help.

252
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,802
I guess it wasn't
obvious because

253
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,578
you told me to come in here.

254
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,375
Know what,
I don't wanna bother y'all,

255
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,744
so probably better if I just be on my way

256
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,146
and have a nice trip.

257
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,313
Oh no,
no, no, stay.

258
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,349
No, no, no,
you're gonna stay and you're

259
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,693
gonna have some dinner with us.

260
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,552
Yeah?

261
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,500
Yeah, it was just a
misunderstanding, that's all.

262
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,294
All right then, let's do it.

263
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,665
(shudders)

264
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,587
You wanted fish.

265
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,236
Thought it was illegal
to fish these lakes.

266
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,632
Grandfather law.

267
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,831
So that's when
an old law applies

268
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,466
to existing situations, but then

269
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,310
a new law applies
to all future ones.

270
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,203
I know what a
grandfather law is.

271
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,740
Okay, So"!!-

272
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,639
Lawyer.

273
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,812
Yeah, I got that.

274
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,615
(chuckles)

275
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,580
What about you, Alex?

276
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,215
What do you do?

277
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,119
Well, right now my buddy has

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
a landscaping business,
so I'm working with him.

279
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,696
You Mexican?

280
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,435
I didn't mean anything by that.

281
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,795
It's just I thought that's a job

282
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,537
that the Mexicans do here.

283
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,274
Well what he does
is pretty high end.

284
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,568
And actually he's starting
a new company soon,

285
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,311
so it's great,
he's really talented.

286
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,749
Well done you, Alex.

287
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,747
Travel's good?

288
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,251
Travel's all rig ht,
yeah, and lucky for me

289
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,290
cannot find any fish, I got
a license to kill a deer.

290
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,525
Oh, cool.

291
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,726
Fuck me trying to get a
license for that these days.

292
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,360
You guys have
anything we can cook

293
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,601
for sides with these?

294
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,365
Yeah, you know, I can...

295
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,904
May be fry the
veggies or potatoes?

296
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,567
The veggies sound good.

297
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,514
- Okay.
-I say the potatoes.

298
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,176
Why don't we do both?

299
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,643
Nah, let's...

300
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,519
Let's eat the potatoes.

301
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,189
I'll get 'em.

302
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,830
So you're Irish?

303
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,900
- I'm from Tipperary.
- Is that New Mexico?

304
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,468
That's a good one.

305
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,605
Actually South of Dublin.

306
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,572
What do you do
for a living out here?

307
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,405
I give backcountry
eco tours to tourists

308
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,374
who want a deeper experience
of the wilderness,

309
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,413
something more than
camping in a parking lot.

310
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,413
Yeah, that's cool.

311
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,981
I mean you and
Jenn are doing it,

312
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,518
so it must be cool, right?

313
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,625
How much would
something like that cost?

314
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,662
Well, I wouldn't know.

315
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,829
You don't know
how much it costs?

316
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,309
I only know how much
they pay me, Alex.

317
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,540
Okay, so they're
already hard boiled,

318
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,384
we just have to put 'em
on for a few minutes.

319
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,256
(Brad): Hang on.

320
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,925
(urinating)

321
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,593
(m utters) Oh, my God.

322
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,668
(mouthing) I'm sorry.

323
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,906
All right then, let's
see what we got here.

324
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,407
- I can do that.
- No, I got it.

325
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,014
This smells delicious.

326
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,452
Yeah, there's garlic,
rosemary and some tyme.

327
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,316
You're a lucky man, Alex.

328
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,721
I know.

329
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,490
So what are your plans?

330
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,986
You guys gonna do
some amazing hikes,

331
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,295
see some spots, what?

332
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,789
I think we're--

333
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,658
You know we live
really hectic lives,

334
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,559
so I think we're
just gonna relax,

335
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,506
stay around here for a few days.

336
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,671
- Yup.
-All right.

337
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,576
You're really grabbing life by the
balls there, Alex, aren't you?

338
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,039
I'm just saying.

339
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,541
If I had a beautiful woman
here like Jenn

340
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,543
I'd wanna take her
to some spots that

341
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,785
weren't on the
tourist trail, right?

342
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,449
As a matter of fact,
Jenn, there is this

343
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,421
absolutely gorgeous waterfall,
I mean really beautiful.

344
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,424
You've probably been
there, right, Alex?

345
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,600
Yeah, totally.

346
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,525
Then you know which
side of the waterfall

347
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,664
to climb down on.

348
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,867
The right side.

349
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,671
The right side.

350
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,313
Good guess, Alex.

351
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,077
I wasn't guessing.

352
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,007
Always see these tourists always

353
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,375
trying to go down the left side.

354
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,676
I mean they think it's safer.

355
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,917
Fucking idiots.

356
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,684
There's also...

357
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,423
Frozen Arrow.

358
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,461
The Blackfoot Trail.

359
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,961
I mean if it were me,

360
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,102
I would wanna take
you to all those spots.

361
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,036
You sure you don't need a guide?

362
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,403
Already have one.

363
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,603
(Brad): Let's eat.

364
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,519
All right.

365
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,624
- That was fun.
-Yeah, thanks for the fish.

366
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,062
All right.

367
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,066
And I'm now ready.

368
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,638
- Cheers!
- Night.

369
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,472
Hey Alex.

370
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,045
Earlier, you said something.

371
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,785
It was a misunderstanding.

372
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,716
You wanna explain that to me?

373
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,516
It was nothing.

374
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,922
Well he's a big boy.

375
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,722
Let him answer.

376
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,457
It's just a funny thing to say.

377
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,064
What'd you mean by it?

378
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,459
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.

379
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,803
Oh, yes you do.

380
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,137
What was a misunderstanding?

381
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:00,475
(dramatic music)

382
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,677
Is this important?

383
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,644
I wouldn't be fucking
asking if it wasn't.

384
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,851
It's on me, okay, I-

385
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,151
Jenn.

386
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,855
Well I come back here and I find

387
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,665
my girlfriend
talking to this guy.

388
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,668
And I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

389
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,507
That's all.

390
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,842
I mean, I don't know you.

391
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,175
So what was the
misunderstanding?

392
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,679
You could be some nut.

393
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,655
She convinced me otherwise.

394
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,931
Like I said, Alex.

395
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,000
You're a lucky guy.

396
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,535
I'm sorry.

397
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,807
Jenn, I...

398
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,204
I think you dropped something.

399
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,206
(Jenn): I got n.

400
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,154
Thanks.

401
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,500
Why don't you invite him to the
house next time, that'd be fun.

402
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,931
I said I'm sorry.

403
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,206
Should we worry about him?

404
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,197
What's that?

405
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,906
Should we worry about him
coming back or I don't know.

406
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,081
No, he's just weird.

407
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,947
Let me get my axe.

408
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,310
I'm gonna sleep
with it in case your

409
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,120
fucking dinner guest
wants to come back

410
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,588
for dessert or something.

411
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,055
You're mad.

412
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,723
Jenn, I don't understand you.

413
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,556
(Jenn): What?!

414
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,858
You invite a total
stranger to eat

415
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,660
dinner with us our first
night on this trip.

416
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,799
Okay, I...

417
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,935
I didn't know what to do.

418
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,609
Okay, I was just being kind.

419
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,071
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,041
Just stay here.

421
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,083
If he turns around and
comes back you yell for me.

422
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:36,929
(dramatic music)

423
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,352
Oh my God,
that smells amazing.

424
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,057
<i>Wm,“!</i>

425
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,700
Thank you.

426
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,826
Remember the survey that we

427
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,033
took on the way over here?

428
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,296
The first question was
about how many times your

429
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,140
boyfriend has made
breakfast in bed for you.

430
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,767
- Remember that?
- Really?

431
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,668
Yeah, and I had to write zero.

432
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,910
Well, I guess I have to change
that from zero to one.

433
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,976
- One, huh?
- Mm hm.

434
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,173
Was it really zero?

435
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,244
Yeah.

436
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,310
- You embarrassed?
-A little bit.

437
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,745
This isn't even a bed,
sol don't--

438
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,986
Believe me, this counts.

439
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,390
Thank you.

440
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,392
What is it about this
place that's so amazing?

441
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,425
- The Blackfoot Trail?
-Yeah.

442
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,099
Why's it called that, anyway?

443
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,029
The local tribes
called it that because

444
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,330
when the trail ends
it circles around

445
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,766
this really small lake,
and the earth

446
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,068
around the lake is black,
so when they hunted

447
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,903
they followed animal
tracks in the black earth

448
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,247
and called it Blackfoot Trail.

449
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,785
What was the lake called?

450
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,177
I don't know.

451
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,377
Seriously?

452
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,012
No no no, picture it,
picture it,

453
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,213
picture it, all right?

454
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,251
You come up this
steep rocky trail.

455
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,685
And then all of a
sudden it levels off

456
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,427
and it's this
beautiful, pristine...

457
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,328
When I was a kid
this was my favorite

458
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,227
place in the whole world.

459
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,728
It all looks so out of
place that high up,

460
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,972
it's like out of some fantasy
novel or something, you know?

461
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,366
Yeah, I have a
feeling your geeky

462
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,467
side is about to come out.

463
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,401
What geeky side?

464
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,436
What geeky side,
the one that made

465
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,104
me watch Legend four times.

466
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,439
Just wait for the pan
where Tom Cruise

467
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,973
is waiting by the
lake for the big

468
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,141
white unicorn to come out.

469
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,053
It's an awesome scene,
what are you talking about?

470
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,918
Yeah, indeed.

471
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,865
We're good?

472
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,027
Yeah.

473
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,817
Of course you're going that way.

474
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,382
This is the way.

475
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,064
Let me see it.

476
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,036
Alex, that's disgusting!

477
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,514
Ugh!

478
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,208
It's pretty bad.

479
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,969
Are you ready?

480
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,099
Ahhh!

481
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,170
Sorry, babe.

482
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,903
(laughs) That's not good.

483
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,645
I don't know why
you're laughing about it.

484
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,950
Why not?

485
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,614
Ow, just don't touch the...
Don't touch it.

486
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,490
Here, let me finish it here.

487
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,925
- (Jenn): It looks...
- It looks terrible.

488
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:01,618
You got the...

489
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,098
Could use some new socks.

490
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,897
- Two pairs.
- Oh, thanks.

491
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,978
(twig snaps)

492
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,518
(twigs snap)

493
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,054
Alex.

494
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,190
Alex!

495
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,105
Alex!
Alex!

496
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,105
- Alex, get up!
- (Alex): Mmm hm.

497
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,673
- (Jenn): Listen.
- (Alex): What?

498
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,347
(Jenn): Just listen,
what is that?

499
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,577
(Alex): What?

500
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,252
(Jenn): Someone's
throwing shit at our tent.

501
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,288
- (Alex): What?
- Just listen.

502
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,551
(twig snap)
What is that?

503
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,522
That? Oh, that's
acorns just falling

504
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,196
from the trees on our tent.

505
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,366
It's fine,
just go back to sleep.

506
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,181
(mud)

507
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,379
That's not an acorn.

508
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,021
(whispers) What is it?

509
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,249
You think it's him?

510
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,628
Let's just listen
for a bit, okay?

511
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,238
Fuck this,
now you got me all paranoid.

512
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,602
Maybe he came back
to throw stones at

513
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,737
the tent or something stupid.

514
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,274
(Alex): No, no, no,
that can't be it.

515
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,189
Whatever it is, it stopped.

516
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,626
So let's just go back
to sleep, okay?

517
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,792
It stopped.

518
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:15,513
(dramatic music)

519
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,746
That wasn't there
last night, was it?

520
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,680
No.

521
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,852
I wanna go home.

522
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,317
I don't wanna be here anymore.

523
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,464
Jenn, come on,
don't overreact, okay?

524
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,224
An acorn did that?

525
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,161
Come on, I've waited
so long for this trip.

526
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:07,503
We're here, and when you
get there, you'll love it.

527
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,571
I promise.

528
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,408
Yeah, okay.

529
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,218
- Can you do this for me?
-Yes.

530
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,150
Thank you.

531
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,479
All right.

532
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,555
(growls)

533
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,685
She's a very good artist,
I have no idea

534
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,520
why you don't
give her a chance.

535
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,432
What do you mean?
She's a great performer.

536
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,661
It's just not my thing.

537
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,167
- I don't-
- Oh, hey.

538
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,800
Hang on a second.

539
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,405
(Jenn): What?

540
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,280
This is wintergreen.

541
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,180
And you can eat this.

542
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,825
Tastes like spearmint gum.

543
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,518
- You want some?
- No.

544
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,620
- You sure?
-Yes, an animal probably peed on it.

545
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,601
(laughs) Your loss.

546
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,701
What's that smell?

547
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:18,903
(dramatic music)

548
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,342
It's nothing.

549
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,488
(Alex): Babe!

550
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,402
(flies buzzing)

551
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,509
Oh my God, Alex!

552
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,825
No.

553
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,768
Oh God, get off of me!

554
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,741
(9 runts)

555
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,871
Oh my God!

556
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,370
<i>UM!</i>

557
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,344
(Alex): Found it!

558
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,874
Thank God!

559
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,722
(laughs) Uh-oh.

560
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,696
What is so funny?

561
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,361
I think you have a little
piece of poo on your face.

562
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,637
Yeah, 'cause
I just fell down on it.

563
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,631
- You fell? You okay?
- I'm fine.

564
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,407
Shouldn't we be saving
that or something?

565
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,443
No, we got plenty of water.

566
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,944
It's just a couple drops.

567
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,406
Here.

568
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,056
- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

569
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,013
- Is this it?
-Yeah, just up there.

570
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,516
It's a real bitch
to get up, isn't it?

571
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,587
I know.

572
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,523
But it's worth it.

573
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,531
- Alex...
- Come on!

574
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,566
- I'm coming.
- Come on!

575
00:39:55,459 --> 00:40:00,431
(dramatic music)

576
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,802
Come on!

577
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,849
(Jenn mumbles)

578
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,040
Alex?

579
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,539
(dramatic sting)

580
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,981
Where's the lake?

581
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,546
I can't believe this.

582
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,047
- Alex...
-I don't understand.

583
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,186
This can't be it, right?

584
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,663
Fuck, I was sure, I was
fucking 100% sure I was.

585
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:56,953
(Jenn): Can you look
at me please--

586
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,887
Just let me think,
just let me think,

587
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,128
let me think,
let me think!

588
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,967
Fuck, god damn it,
what the fuck is this?!

589
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,839
Please tell me you
have a map in your bag.

590
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,579
I never needed a map!

591
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,003
Well, we do now.

592
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,108
I don't have one.

593
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,107
So then where are we?

594
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,576
I obviously don't
know, all right?

595
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,643
Well you said that you've done

596
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,146
this so many times,
you said it was

597
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,948
like a few years
ago you did this!

598
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,792
Yeah, I've been in the
park a bunch of times!

599
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,792
Trail, Alex,
you said you did the trail.

600
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,725
Yeah.

601
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,833
Not since high school, but...

602
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,079
- It's not...
-I put it here!

603
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,078
I put it right here!

604
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,182
It's not...

605
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,826
- I took it out.
-What?

606
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,564
Your phone.

607
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,256
I took it out.

608
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,930
Where is it?

609
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,064
- In the car.
-Why would you do that?

610
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,196
I didn't want you on that thing

611
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,143
the whole time we were here.

612
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,569
I didn't reach for that once.

613
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,275
I wanted to bring it in case
we needed it, which we do!

614
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,173
(Alex): Can't get
reception out here anyway--

615
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,653
Well, I would have loved to try!

616
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,090
When was the last time you were

617
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,128
sure of where you were?

618
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,727
I was sure the whole time!

619
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,139
No, think, Alex!

620
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,968
When was it?

621
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,943
I don't...

622
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,607
Maybe the fork in the trail.

623
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,685
The first one,
the second one?

624
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,324
First one.

625
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,785
Are you serious?

626
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,052
(Alex): Come on,
don't freak out!

627
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,964
I don't want to be
freaking out rig ht now,

628
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,624
but we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

629
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,026
We don't have anything,

630
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,729
we don't have a map,
we don't have a cell phone!

631
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,069
We don't have anything, we
haven't seen anyone in so long!

632
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,865
(Alex): It's okay.

633
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:23,970
Why, why did we have to come

634
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,080
so far out on my
first camping trip?

635
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,840
Why couldn't it have
just been a regular trip?

636
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,976
Why do you always
have to show off?

637
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:30,907
I'm not showing off--

638
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,141
(Jenn): Why do you
always try to impress me?!

639
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,376
I'm not trying to
impress you, okay?!

640
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,856
(Jenn): Good, 'cause I'm not
fucking impressed rig ht now!

641
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,116
Good!

642
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,314
I'm not trying to
fucking impress you!

643
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,988
Alex, could we be
honest for a second?

644
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,595
I'd love to be honest for once.

645
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,733
I wish I never came.

646
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,166
This whole thing was a mistake.

647
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,692
(Alex): Come on, Jenn, don't-

648
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:50,933
We should be going
home tomorrow,

649
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,097
but you fucked it up!

650
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,235
You always fuck it all up,
you're such a fucking loser!

651
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,742
This stupid lake, why did
we have to come here?!

652
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,987
I don't even care, why?!

653
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,319
Why?!

654
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,759
I was gonna propose to you.

655
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,742
(dramatic music)

656
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,157
I'm really sorry.

657
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,230
I had no idea.

658
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,748
It's okay.

659
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,946
We should probably make camp.

660
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,988
We can go tomorrow

661
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,355
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

662
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,253
Sounds good.

663
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:53,716
(eerie music)

664
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:58,097
(eerie music)

665
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,139
(twig snaps)

666
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,370
(twigs snap)

667
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,941
(animals skitter)

668
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,998
(thunder)

669
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,955
(heavy breathing
and footsteps)

670
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,400
(sniffing)

671
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,283
(growling)

672
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:41,584
Was it a-

673
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,419
No, no, no, no,
it was a raccoon.

674
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,490
You can tell me the truth.

675
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,635
No, I saw the
little shit last night.

676
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,334
Shit!

677
00:48:56,066 --> 00:49:01,038
(dramatic music)

678
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,546
Is this right?

679
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,383
Yeah, just need to take a
turn at that overgrown trail.

680
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,552
It doesn't seem this far down.

681
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,286
No, we're good, we're good.

682
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,392
Watch your step.
Watch your step there.

683
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,713
Shit.
Should we go back?

684
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,451
I don't know.

685
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,426
What are the chances of
this leading to something?

686
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,022
Pretty good, right?
It's a national park,

687
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,366
it's gotta lead somewhere.

688
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,704
Here.

689
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,474
Thank you.

690
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,223
What is that?

691
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,122
Bear bed.

692
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,563
Okay.

693
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:06,766
Okay.

694
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,540
Let's get as far as
we can before dark.

695
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,036
Right?

696
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,146
Come on.

697
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,777
Let's go, Alex.

698
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,068
I'm so sorry.

699
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,241
Did you mean those
things you said?

700
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,646
No, I didn't.

701
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,353
'Cause Jenn, I mean if
that's the way you feel--

702
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,755
No.

703
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,723
I should have never said that.

704
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,701
I was just really mad.

705
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,135
I'm sorry.

706
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,273
I love you.

707
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,541
Do you wanna see it?

708
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:25,609
The ring?

709
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,380
(Alex): Yeah.

710
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,791
If you want to.

711
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,339
No, no, no,
no, don't, no.

712
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,669
Actually, just...

713
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,177
Wait.

714
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:58,513
Okay.

715
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,261
So hungry-

716
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:14,366
I think I have half
a protein bar left.

717
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,737
This is all we have?

718
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,564
This is it?

719
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,936
Yeah.

720
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,773
Oh, wait a second.

721
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,475
Except for...

722
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,483
Ta-da!

723
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,756
Come on, really?

724
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,223
Yeah.

725
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,491
- You want some?
-Yeah.

726
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,456
Oooh, screw top.

727
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:48,765
(laughing)

728
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,575
- You first.
- Okay.

729
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,379
To us.

730
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,878
To us.

731
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,483
That is so good.

732
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,516
Have some,
it's great.

733
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:16,657
(Alex): That is good.

734
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,669
I know this sucks.

735
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,635
Could be worse.

736
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:29,735
How's that?

737
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,677
At least we're together.

738
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,319
I mean it.

739
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,429
Come here.

740
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,585
(twig snaps)

741
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,724
(twig snaps)

742
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,869
(whispers) What is that, Alex?

743
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:31,865
I don't know.

744
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,817
Alex, do you think it's a bear?

745
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,014
Hey!

746
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,983
(footsteps)

747
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,537
Is it gone?

748
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,330
- Let's get back in the tent.
- Okay.

749
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,907
Okay, let's go.

750
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,524
It's okay.

751
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,461
You scared it off,
we're good.

752
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,437
Okay, we're good.

753
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,568
- Hi.
- Hey.

754
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,446
So I was thinking...

755
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,037
That I should phone
down to the front desk

756
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,143
and order us some room service.

757
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,444
Maybe a couple's massage?

758
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,558
Deep tissue.

759
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,457
(laughing)

760
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,524
We're gonna be okay.

761
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,129
I know.

762
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,479
- We should get going, okay?
- Mm hm.

763
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,160
(growling)

764
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,632
What?
Alex?

765
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,966
- What?
- Stay quiet.

766
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,498
- You're scaring me--
- Stay quiet, stay quiet.

767
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,569
Did he come back?

768
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,940
(growling)

769
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,013
What the fuck is it doing?

770
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,111
What the fuck is it doing?

771
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,558
Did he come back?

772
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,224
Shhh.

773
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,034
(growling)

774
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:52,973
Please move on.

775
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,735
Please move on, please move on,
please move on, please move on.

776
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,913
Please move on.

777
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,253
- Ah, fuck.
-What?

778
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:15,817
Oh God.

779
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,092
Is it out there,
did it come back?

780
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,254
What do we do, we don't
have any food in here!

781
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,531
- I know.
-Where's my axe?

782
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,129
Fuck, where's my axe?!

783
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,108
In your bag?

784
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,577
I left my bag by the fire.

785
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,837
(growling)

786
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,844
I can't believe
this is happening.

787
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,216
What do we do?

788
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,151
What do we do?

789
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,616
We don't have any fucking air.

790
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,084
Alex?

791
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,069
(sniffing)

792
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,839
(growling)

793
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,827
(roaring)

794
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,103
(screaming)

795
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,053
Behind me!
Get behind me!

796
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,017
Get the fuck out!

797
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,386
Get the fuck out!

798
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,096
Get out!

799
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,167
(roaring)

800
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,836
(screaming)

801
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,876
(roaring)

802
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,316
I'm gonna wrap it.

803
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,147
I know, just...

804
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,422
Okay, Okay-

805
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,894
It's okay, I'm gonna wrap it.

806
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,736
(screaming)
It's all right.

807
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,364
It's okay.

808
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,031
(Alex): Jenn,
I can't feel my foot!

809
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,010
It's okay!

810
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,449
It's okay, it's okay.

811
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,339
I can't feel my foot.

812
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,307
We're gonna get you out of here,

813
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,946
we're gonna crawl out
of here if we have to.

814
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:54,876
You hear me?

815
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,845
My God,
I'm gonna fucking die out here!

816
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,947
- No you're not!
- I'm gonna fucking die!

817
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,086
Alex, you're fine!

818
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,330
Alex, you're gonna be fine.

819
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,968
(roaring)

820
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,033
(screaming)

821
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,714
Alex!

822
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,791
(screaming)

823
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,440
(Alex): Run, Jenn, run!

824
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,299
(roaring)

825
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,502
(heart beating)

826
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,340
(inaudible)

827
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,101
(roaring)

828
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,361
(thwack)
