00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,829
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

161
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,703
There's only so many times you can tell
the President of the United States

162
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
that you'll call him back.

163
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,756
- You wanna get to the point?
- EOBARD: <i>Yes.</i>

164
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,386
I brought you here
to discuss a sensitive matter.

165
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,172
And it goes by the name of Malcolm Merlyn.

166
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
What about him?

167
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,475
I want you to keep an eye on him for me.

168
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,640
We're not your watchdogs.

169
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,972
(SCOFFS)
What was that?

170
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,483
What he meant was we're not spies,
we're thieves.

171
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,148
Mr. Thawne! I need to speak with you!

172
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,197
I just need five minutes of your time.

173
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,150
Please! Reality is at stake!
The world isn't right!

174
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,369
(DR. HEYWOOD PANTING)

175
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,829
Okay. Let him go. Let him go.
Let's see what he has to say.

176
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,367
It's okay.

177
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,163
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

178
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,749
First of all, awesome office.

179
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,009
I guess it pays to be
the smartest man in the world,

180
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,512
which is why
I've come to you for help.

181
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,682
You were saying
that the world isn't right?

182
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,851
Yeah. This world we're in now is wrong.

183
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,272
Reality has changed somehow.

184
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,525
How do you know all this?

185
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,604
Um, well, there are signs everywhere,
if you know where to look.

186
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:09,201
There's subtle inconsistencies
in the fabric of reality.

187
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,527
I call them scars.

188
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,947
You know, like
after you've been operated on.

189
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, reality has been operated on.

190
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,458
Truly fascinating.

191
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
- Yeah.
- I'm giddy with excitement.

192
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,383
What's that got to do with him?

193
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,052
Well, Mr. Thawne could help me fix it.

194
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,721
Look, all right. You're a genius.

195
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,558
You figured out cold fusion,
you saved the polar bears.

196
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,430
You fixed global warming.

197
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,096
I mean, you made desalination sustainable.

198
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,399
I mean, you solve problems like this,
like, every day.

199
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,480
If anyone, anyone,
can figure out why these scars exist

200
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:52,327
and how to put the world back
to the way it was, it's you, dude.

201
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,123
You know what?

202
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,122
I think you're on to something.

203
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,914
Something is definitely not right here.

204
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,669
Fix it.

205
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,838
- Take Mr...
- Heywood.

206
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,303
Mr. Heywood.
Take Mr. Heywood out for some fresh air.

207
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,597
And, uh, kill him.

208
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,426
Me?

209
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,266
Look, I don't understand.
If this is about my work,

210
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,770
nobody pays attention to it. My mom's
the only person that reads my blog!

211
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,150
Stop talking.

212
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,109
Guys. I am not a threat to anyone.

213
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,902
Unless I'm right.

214
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,615
Am I right?

215
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,160
Sounds like fitting final words to me.

216
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,002
Whatever science or magic altered reality

217
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,801
must have left small scars in my memory
that my subconscious picked up on.

218
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,089
So, if I'm not a conspiracy theorist
no one listens to, then...

219
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,597
- Who am I?
- Dead.

220
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,972
- Wait!
- What?

221
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,645
He said, "Wait." I heard him.
He said, "Wait."

222
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,312
You promised me
things were gonna be like old times.

223
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,984
It is like old times, only better.

224
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,441
Central City is ours! No more Flash!

225
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,740
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

226
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,484
Leave Thawne to me. I always have a plan.

227
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,490
- You know this.
- Well, fill me in.

228
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,998
SNART: <i>When the time is right.</i>
RORY: <i>Ah, yes, we're partners.</i>

229
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,826
Except when you refuse to
tell me what's going on.

230
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,755
You son of a...

231
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,249
(GROANS)

232
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,502
Sorry, buddy.

233
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,920
I owed you that.

234
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,932
You saved my life. Why?

235
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,018
Because I'm an idiot.

236
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,147
This could be one of my scars talking.

237
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,354
But I'm sensing
you're telling me the truth.

238
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,986
Let's move.

239
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
Okay.

240
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,825
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>This is crazier
than any of my crazy theories.</i>

241
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,203
You're trying to tell me
a group called "The Legion of Doom"

242
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,295
used something called
"The Spear of Destiny" to rewrite reality?

243
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,214
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

244
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,296
- You did.
- Me?

245
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,720
Now, do you only remember the old reality

246
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,223
because you're part of the Legion?

247
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,387
I'm not a part of anything.

248
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,520
I just made a terrible mistake.

249
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,151
Die, you filthy aliens!

250
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,077
Come on. Wait a minute.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,493
- This is the guy who's gonna fix reality?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Uh...

253
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,498
Who are you guys
and what are you doing here?

254
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,745
We need your help.

255
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,372
What do you got?
A clogged toilet or something?

256
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,753
'Cause, you know, I'm off duty now.

257
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,094
- You're not a janitor.
- Yeah, I am. It says so on my name...

258
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,840
- On my nametag.
- You're a geek, a nerd.

259
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,926
A genius. It's why we're here.

260
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,350
Is this about the dipole magnets
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

261
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,893
'Cause I'm totally gonna return those.

262
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,901
Look, man. He said you're the one
that can fix this reality.

263
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,150
"Fix this reality"? What do you mean?

264
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,239
You guys think
there's something wrong, too?

265
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,941
RORY: Woah.

266
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,032
- That's private stuff, man.
- What is it?

267
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,742
I don't know exactly.

268
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,246
- I mean, I think I know, but I don't...
- Spit it out, Haircut.

269
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,790
Well, um...

270
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,129
I kinda built it on impulse.

271
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,670
You know, like on instinct.

272
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,921
I call it a Trans-reality Multiplexer.

273
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,676
No real reason.
I just thought it sounded cool.

274
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,932
Don't you get it, man?

275
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,725
Your "impulse" was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

276
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,271
"Reality scar."

277
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,937
So, what does this fun gun do?

278
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,021
Theoretically, it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus.

279
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,903
Acting like a Control-Z for memories.

280
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,448
- "Control-Z?"
- Like an "undo" command on a computer.

281
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,455
I was going to try the new version
on my latest test subject,

282
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,284
<i>but then I was
worried it might melt his brain.</i>

283
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,246
- Axel.
- No, it's Tesla, actually.

284
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,964
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

285
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,422
No. He's Axel.
You gave me that little guy for Christmas.

286
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,967
You haven't been
running any tests on him, have you?

287
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,172
What? No.

288
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,177
No! No!

289
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,854
All right. Actually, for it to work,
you have to shoot him in the head.

290
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,055
Why would you say that?

291
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,858
How many people
are gonna point guns at me today?

292
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,773
Oh, my God, you killed him!

293
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,534
You son of a bitch!

294
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,369
It works.

295
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,546
So, Mr. Rory is having second thoughts?

296
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,541
Mick's just a little confused.
I can control him.

297
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,128
- Obviously, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

298
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,386
I just need your help
getting him back on the reservation

299
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,101
before Thawne finds out.

300
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,806
We have bigger problems.

301
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,979
What if Heywood's only
the first of his old teammates

302
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,391
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for.

303
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,442
I knew we should've killed them all.

304
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,234
It was a dangerous oversight
to keep them alive in any capacity.

305
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,823
Does that include Mick?

306
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,902
At the very least,
we should have wiped his brain.

307
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,737
MALCOLM: <i>Such as it is.</i>

308
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,364
You trusted your buddy a little too much.

309
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,869
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

310
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,043
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

311
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,748
Yes, boss?

312
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,007
DARHK: <i>Mick Rory's gotten himself lost.</i>

313
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,918
Find him, would you?

314
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
Where do you suggest we start our search?

315
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,345
You can track him with this.

316
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,389
I put a GPS in Mick.

317
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,763
I don't trust anyone.

318
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,315
Okay, on the count of three. One, two...

319
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
(GRUNTS)

320
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,573
You!

321
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,657
I deserved that.

322
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,207
Damn straight you did.

323
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,458
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
you'd all be dead.

324
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,256
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot. You trapped
each of us in our own personal hell.

325
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,547
Do you have any idea
how many toilets I've cleaned?

326
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,299
So many.

327
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,262
Amaya.

328
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,060
- Sara.
- Hey, dumbasses.

329
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,150
They have no clue who you are.

330
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,318
They work for Damien Darhk.

331
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,397
Oh!

332
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,898
Crap.

333
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,124
- I don't like the way she's looking at us.
- I like the way she's looking at us.

334
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,461
Love the suits.

335
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,725
Get off my friend!

336
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,846
All right, guys, time out!
Come on! Come on, look!

337
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,688
I know this may sound crazy,

338
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,025
but doesn't it seem like
there's something wrong with this world?

339
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,564
- Yeah, Rory sold out the boss...
- AMAYA: <i>To throw in with you losers.</i>

340
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,857
"Losers"? I'll have you know,
in my reality,

341
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,443
you and I had sex,
and we both liked it very much.

342
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,829
- RAY: <i>Nate, not helping.</i>
- Amaya, look at me.

343
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,865
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

344
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,499
Look, this isn't how it's supposed to be.

345
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,964
Okay, you're supposed to be heroes,
like us.

346
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:48,887
Okay. Allow me
to demonstrate my superpowers. Okay?

347
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,677
Knock it off, you idiot.
The Spear took away your powers.

348
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,229
But it's true.
Nate used to be able to steel-up

349
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,774
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

350
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,655
These guys are heroes.

351
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,191
That is so great.

352
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,989
We kill heroes.

353
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,236
(SIGHS)

354
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,116
(GRUNTS)

355
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,013
One more person hits me,
I'm gonna punch back.

356
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,931
What the hell happened to me?

357
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,858
It appears that after the Legion
got the Spear and changed reality,

358
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,315
they kept us around as their pets.

359
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,778
Yeah, except for you.

360
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,365
You helped the Legion steal the Spear.

361
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,490
Speaking of, the Legion is
probably on their way here to kill us.

362
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,736
We need to get out of here.

363
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,203
Yeah, we got to find some place to hide.

364
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,454
RAY: <i>Your mom's basement?</i>

365
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,047
- Really?
- I pay rent.

366
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,383
So, legally, it's my basement. Kind of.

367
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,673
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

368
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,140
The best. It's the perfect amount of
mayo-meat-bread ratio that really gives...

369
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,557
Focus! We need to figure out
how we can rescue the rest of the team.

370
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,981
And get the Spear back so we can
undo everything the Legion has done.

371
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,476
Except, now they know we're trying
to get the band back together.

372
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,188
Except, they don't know
that you've gotten to me. Which means...

373
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,528
You can sneak into the Legion
and pretend to be Darhk's favorite chick.

374
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,827
It's our best shot at getting Amaya back.

375
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,204
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

376
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:44,248
Well, the Professor and Jax are working
on some secret project for Thawne.

377
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,003
I don't know where the Englishman is.

378
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,001
Neither do I.

379
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,093
I can only imagine
how those psychopaths are torturing Rip.

380
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,845
Gideon, I've discovered
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

381
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,225
Rum.

382
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,139
(CLANGS)

383
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,858
And speaking of which, I'm gonna need you
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

384
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,023
Ooh. And some nachos.

385
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,608
<i>- I will do nothing of the sort.</i>
- What?

386
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,366
You will do as I tell you, Gideon.
I'm your captain!

387
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,451
<i>Then it's time for you
to start acting like one!</i>

388
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,543
<i>Now sit up straight
and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.</i>

389
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,036
Gideon.

390
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,625
For the thousandth time, I've got no way
of getting the reserve power back online.

391
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:36,050
And I've got no way
of sending out any signal of any sort.

392
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,968
Which means...

393
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,387
Which means that I am destined

394
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,437
to live out
the rest of my days right here.

395
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,234
With you.

396
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,570
<i>While you were
honing your confectionery skills,</i>

397
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,238
<i>I've been working on new algorithms</i>

398
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,941
<i>to redirect power
from the idle quadrants of the ship.</i>

399
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,235
<i>You need to focus
on boosting your distress signal</i>

400
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,074
<i>once power is fully back online.</i>

401
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>Now, chin up, Captain!</i>

402
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,245
I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.

403
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,164
<i>I believe in you.</i>

404
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,507
<i>Now, let's get to work.</i>

405
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,839
First, I'm going to vomit.

406
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,760
And second...

407
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,593
Let's do this.

408
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,027
When your minions bring Mick back,
I want to arrange a meeting with Thawne.

409
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,937
And when I say
"arrange a meeting," I mean...

410
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,610
- One between Thawne and his maker?
- DARHK: <i>Cute.</i>

411
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,113
A little mustache-twirly for my taste.

412
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,283
You're really gonna have to
step up your tactics, Leonard.

413
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,661
You didn't think that Thawne was actually
going to fall for that fake meeting trick?

414
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,326
This is not <i>The Godfather.</i>

415
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,995
Although we do agree with your sentiment,
Eobard has to go.

416
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,796
So glad you both approve.

417
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,166
Which brings us back
to our original conundrum.

418
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,342
"How to kill a speedster?"

419
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,174
We found your partner.
And he's got himself some friends.

420
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,301
And where, pray tell,
is your partner Ms. Lance?

421
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,303
We got separated in the fight.

422
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,055
I haven't heard from her since.

423
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,228
So, I'm guessing she's dead by now.

424
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,520
That's the thing about Sara Lance.
She never stays dead for very long.

425
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,816
Sorry. We underestimated them.
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

426
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,495
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Not so fast.

427
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,331
Yes?

428
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,752
I have a question for you.

429
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,918
Which one is your favorite trophy?

430
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,672
That's like asking a girl
to pick just one pair of shoes.

431
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,506
Oh, please.
Everyone has their favorite kill.

432
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,012
Do you want to hear mine?

433
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,267
Her name was "Black Canary."

434
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,103
I will never forget her.

435
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,445
It was so delicious.

436
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,113
Killing her.

437
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,868
They told me that I'd done it before,
but I can't imagine it ever getting old.

438
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,076
The very first thing I did in this reality
was acquire my magic.

439
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,378
I'm going to miss you, Ms. Lance.

440
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,546
Having you around to attend to
my every whim was too enticing to pass up.

441
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,389
Plus, it's so hard
to find good help these days.

442
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,760
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

443
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,221
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

444
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,305
No better time than the present.

445
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,318
Amaya. The honor is yours.

446
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,564
Good bye.

447
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,819
(EXHALES)

448
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,237
What the hell?

449
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,913
Shoot now! Explain later.

450
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,131
Damien, what did I tell you?

451
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,548
(SIGHS) For what it's worth, I thought
it was a very good bad guy monologue.

452
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,939
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.
You have nothing to worry about.

453
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,812
Hey!

454
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,935
What do you want?

455
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,486
There's just one thing I don't understand.

456
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,151
If Thawne made this world to punish us,

457
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,120
how are your mom's sandwiches
so good, bro?

458
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,327
Her condiment game is on point, right?

459
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,454
She even had gluten-free bread for me.

460
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,786
Well, let's just get back to the ship.

461
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,164
We don't know where the ship is, or Rip.

462
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,464
Which means our next move
should be to rescue the Professor.

463
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,293
Speaking of which, what did Thawne
have you two working on?

464
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,045
Grey did most of the work.

465
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,638
I just made his life hell.

466
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,516
From what I could tell,
he was building some sort of reactor.

467
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,679
He said it would burn 1,000 times
hotter than the sun once it's operational.

468
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,222
I like the sound of that.

469
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,474
Could be a power generator,
or a particle accelerator.

470
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,069
What if Thawne is
trying to destroy the Spear?

471
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,480
Impossible. You need
the blood of Christ to destroy it.

472
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,403
<i>That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.</i>

473
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,151
Unless he figured out there's another way,
by incinerating it.

474
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,158
But why would Thawne
want to destroy the Spear?

475
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,989
Oh, no.

476
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,245
If he destroys the Spear,

477
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,664
that means this reality
cannot be rewritten.

478
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,547
Okay. We better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

479
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,346
But, even if we find it,
we don't know how to access its powers.

480
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,679
Rory does. You were there, right,
when they used the Spear?

481
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,229
They read out of some book
called The Calibrate.

482
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,730
<i>Caliber.</i>

483
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,687
(STAMMERS) Kalablos.

484
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,068
Something like that.

485
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,862
Do you remember what language it was in?

486
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,526
Aramaic.

487
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,237
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

488
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,534
<i>Passion of the Christ.</i> Good movie.

489
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,363
Mick, would you be able
to recognize the incantation?

490
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,705
Yeah.

491
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,590
Hey, if they figure out this incantation,
and we get our hands on the Spear,

492
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,208
I want you to use it.

493
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,544
I should've listened to you
back in World War I.

494
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,754
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

495
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,965
I might've been tempted to use it
to change my own future.

496
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,720
Now, we've got nothing to lose.

497
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,315
Marty, Marty, Marty.

498
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,318
I know you've been
working so hard on this project,

499
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,361
and I wanted to come by and say thank you.

500
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,865
But if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

501
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,700
I'll have to kill you.

502
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:36,080
One moment, Mr. Thawne.
I just need one more moment.

503
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,073
- (TYPING ON KEYBOARD)
- (BEEPING)

504
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,581
There. There.

505
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,380
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional.

506
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,009
Though it may take some time
for the core to reach peak temperature.

507
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,222
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

508
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,435
I was hoping to see my family tonight.

509
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,479
No. No, no. You can't leave
in your moment of glory.

510
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,898
No, you keep monitoring the core
and make sure the reaction remains stable.

511
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,855
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>I think we've got something!</i>

512
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,984
We pieced together a passage
from the Kalabros.

513
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,823
Aka "the Word of God."

514
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,414
All right, Jax. It's on you to restore
Stein's mind before we get to the lab.

515
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,910
We got to destroy the reactor
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

516
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,628
- Yeah, no doubt.
- And remember,

517
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,964
you guys are going in there
without your powers.

518
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,170
Don't worry. I know that place
like the back of my hand.

519
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,752
- What about Mick?
- Mick's staying here.

520
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,795
We can't trust him.

521
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,424
Not after what you've done.

522
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,054
After what I've done?

523
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,432
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be
walking around like sheep.

524
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,943
If it wasn't for you, we never would've
been turned into sheep in the first place.

525
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,353
We trusted you, Mick.

526
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,981
<i>We can't afford
to make that mistake again.</i>

527
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:54,988
Let's go.

528
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,762
League of Losers cut you loose?

529
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,764
Nobody cuts me loose.

530
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,596
I'm done with those people.

531
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,229
What do you say
we burn this city to the ground?

532
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,110
Knowing Sara,
she's rallied the team by now.

533
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,278
Those idiots aren't who I'm worried about.

534
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,152
Relax, boys.

535
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,863
The prodigal son has returned.

536
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,116
And he's got some news for us,
isn't that right, Mick?

537
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,823
(GRUNTS)

538
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:47,669
Our old friend Eobard has built a device
to destroy the Spear.

539
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,876
No wonder Eobard doesn't want us using it

540
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,045
before he locks in
his own version of reality.

541
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,047
Which, I assume, means erasing all of us?

542
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,590
And your pals?

543
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,045
My Pals?

544
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,050
They wanna steal the Spear
before the deed's done.

545
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,678
I think you can see
what I'm getting at, gentlemen.

546
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,804
The four of us
are no match for a speedster,

547
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,689
so while Thawne is fighting the Legends...

548
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,187
We'll grab the Spear
from under both their noses.

549
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,526
Exactly.

550
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,948
- The enemy of my enemy...
- Is our opportunity.

(TYPING AT KEYBOARD)

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,008
The status of the machine, Doctor.

553
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,587
Please tell Mr. Thawne
I'm working as fast as I can.

554
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,761
I've powered up the reactor. I just need
to make a few adjustments to the core.

555
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,599
Wait. You already turned it on?

556
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,104
I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

557
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,847
Grey, we need to talk.

558
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,766
"Grey?"

00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,142
(SCOFFS)

560
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,609
Please. Don't kill me!
I've done everything Mr. Thawne wanted.

561
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,399
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm just gonna make you better...

562
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,111
Grey, what have you done?

563
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,115
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,
he'll have to do it himself.

564

(HEAVY BREATHING)

565
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,619
Guys, we got a problem.

566
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,083
You got to get here ASAP.

567
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,631
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

568
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,758
Ray, find us
the quickest way into the lab, now!

569
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,132
Look, you got to believe me, okay?

570
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,054
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

571
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,974
Is this some sort of test? Of my loyalty?

572
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,597
- Does Mr. Thawne even...
- Look, this isn't about Thawne.

573
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,099
It's about you and me.

574
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,767
I assure you, my dedication to Mr. Thawne
has never been stronger.

575
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,146
Did you just press the silent alarm?

576
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,905
What?

577
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,653
No, it's a secondary
radiation sensor for the nuclear core.

578
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,785
Grey, you are a crappy liar
in any reality.

SARA: <i>Martin?</i>

580
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,954
I can't talk any sense into him.
And he just triggered an alarm.

581
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,505
Which means Thawne will be here soon.

582
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,502
Or now.

583
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
Well...

584
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,599
Looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

585
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,346
I should have wiped you from existence
when I had the chance.

00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,309
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,819
to know that Merlyn was right?

588
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,990
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

589
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,203

and cementing this reality for all time.

any of you will ever know.

If it weren't for your futile efforts,
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

Not so fast, Speedy.
You have something we want.

597

You need a lesson
on how to share your toys, Eobard.

Yeah, time for us
to get a turn with the Spear.

And do what with it?

Sara. Why do we always
find ourselves in this situation?

Now hand it over.

Mick, no.
You already gave it to them once.

00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,591
An attack dog.

626
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,253
Now that's not true.

627
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,764
Sure, we both know
you're not the sharpest tool in the shed,

628
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,010
but that's why we're partners.

629
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,723
Remember?

630
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,563
You're right.

631
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,730
I'm not a genius.

632
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,117
But I'm no one's dog, Leonard.

633
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,906
RORY: <i>Not anymore.</i>

634
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:04,455
Well, I guess
you can teach an old dog new tricks.

635
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,091
Undo this mess.

636
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,723
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

637
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,119
I am sorry about your friend, Mick.

638
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,668
I know you loved her to pieces.

639
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,671
No.

640

(GUN POWERS DOWN)

644
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,285
Well, if you want something done right...

645
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,033
Well done, Leonard.

646
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,164
You bastard.

647
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,034
I'll kill you all.

648
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,791
Actually, I believe that's my line.

649
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,175
Now, where were we
before I was so rudely interrupted?

650
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,359
(CHUCKLING)

651
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,034
Well...

652
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,203
I guess we're done here.

(SIGHS)

654
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,062
You know the really swell thing
about the Spear being destroyed?

655
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,025
Now you can't stop us from killing you.

656
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,319
(CHUCKLES)
Please, don't insult my intelligence.

657
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,611
Even at your fastest,
you're moving in slow motion to me.

658
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,366
Except, they're not alone.

659
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,908
I say we go down fighting.

660
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,128
You kill one of us, we kill all of you.

661
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,628
For Amaya.

662
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,964
EOBARD: <i>Don't.</i>

663
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,757
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me.

664
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,713
<i>Not without powers or weapons.</i>

665
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,930
And the truth is,
I don't want to see any more of you dead.

666
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,557
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no. Quite the opposite.

667
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:14,903
But because it is so delicious

668
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,904
knowing that you'll be forced to
live your lives in a reality that I...

669
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,243
Well, that we created.

670
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,116
<i>You will walk this world
knowing that something isn't quite right.</i>

671
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,336
That for all your trying,
you only made things worse.

672
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,121
And no one will ever believe you

673
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,791
<i>when you tell them
about all the sacrifices you made,</i>

674
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,131
and how close you came to being Legends.

675
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,471
That sounds
like a fitting punishment to me.

676
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,601
What do you think, Professor Stein?

677
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,599
I don't care what you do to them as long
as I never have to see Mr. Jackson again.

678
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,149
EOBARD: <i>Ah.</i> (CHUCKLES)

679
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,607
Fair enough.

680
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,030
You're free to go.

681
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,824
You're just gonna let them walk?

682
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,328
Be glad I'm letting you
and your fellow traitors do the same.

683
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,328
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

684
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,290
remember this grace

685
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,832
and the fact that I could
kill any of you in the blink of an eye.

686
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,306
My mom's not gonna be cool with that.

687
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,683
Do I look like I give a damn?

688
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,513
I can't believe that's it.

689
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,186
I refuse to believe that this is it.

690
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,193
Without the Spear,
there's no way we can undo any of this.

691
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,654
There is one way.

692
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,069
Time travel.

693
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,649
What do you mean?

694
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,828
We go back in time, to 1916,

695
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,032
and we stop the Legion from ever getting
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

696
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:54,586
No, we are not supposed to
change events we participated in.

697
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,713
And if we do,
we risk time folding in on itself.

698
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,384
Even if we weren't
worried about messing with time,

699
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,178
we can't go anywhere.

700
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,380
Or anywhen.

701
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,260
We don't even know
where the <i>Waverider</i> is.

702
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,350
If it even exists in this reality.

703
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,061
Well, if it does,
there's one person who knows where it is.

704
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,182
We just have to find him.

705
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,776
GIDEON: <i>I've directed all available power</i>

706
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>to the main navigational
controls, Captain.</i>

707
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,446
Thank you, Gideon.

708
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,192
Now, I've started
the communications protocol,

709
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,745
and if I just
splice these two wires together...

710
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,912
<i>Your distress signal will be broadcast.</i>

711
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:40,256
Surely, the rest of the team
must be out there somewhere, listening.
