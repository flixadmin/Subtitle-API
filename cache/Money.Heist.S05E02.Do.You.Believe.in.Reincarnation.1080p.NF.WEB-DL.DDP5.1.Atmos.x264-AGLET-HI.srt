in one move and you don't do it...

156
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,416
Then it's because you don't know
that you can.

157
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Exactly.

158

Sierra's working alone.

I'm beginning to like
that fucking nutcase.

160

I'm gonna throw a couple punches
at this piece of shit.

164
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
[Palermo] Bogotá, stop!

165
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,666
Even with these shards in my back,
I'm going to kick your ass.

166
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,291
For fuck's sake, Bogotá!

167
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,416
We're releasing him.
He can't be beat to shit.

168
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
We're not, we're releasing his corpse.

169
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,000
Go on, the minister's gonna be waiting
for me with a medal.

170
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,375
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

171
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,583
Every time you hit him, you're hitting us.

172
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
You're gonna screw us
'cause of your pride.

173
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,250
We're already screwed.

This won't change a thing.
All we have left is our dignity.

175

You wanna get your revenge.

176
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,500
Revenge is an act of selfishness,
you know that.

177
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,916
It's respect.

178
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,708
It's respect for ourselves.
It's respect for the person he executed.

- That's what it is.
- [Rio] I'm with him!

Are you all fucking crazy or what?

Lisbon told us she's letting him go.
She's out there buying us time.

I don't know Lisbon,
but I did know Nairobi.

183

They're about to kill us,
but we're getting rid of him before that.

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,708
Oh, now you're killing him? Now, huh?

185
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,458
Now you're the piece of shit
yelling in the back "Kill him"?

186
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,458
When you had the chance, you couldn't.
You didn't have the balls.

You didn't have the balls.

Okay, asshole, now you're accusing me?

191
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,083
The only one to blame here is him.
He pulled the trigger.

192
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,250
That bastard over there did it
because he wanted to.

193
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
So leave me the fuck alone.

194

Do you want me
to take some flowers to the morgue?

I'm sure your little friend

And still plenty tight.

What would you do if he killed Stockholm?

You beat the shit out of Arturo
and he just teased you.

199
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,916
That motherfucker over there killed her.

What, so you get a free pass
but no one else does?

- Let's find out.
- Okay.

We will release Gandía.

213
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,458
Before I do, I need to ask the Professor.

214

You go ahead and ask
whatever you need to ask.

You've got four minutes.

And what do you propose we do?

217
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
We need to organize an escape.

You know most of them. They're the best.

- At your order, sir!

- Yes, sir.

this is going to be a massacre.

325
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,291
I need men
who won't ask who's behind the mask

when they have to pull the trigger.

327
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,125
Special Forces will ask questions
because somewhere in their brains

328
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,791
hides the deep-seated notion
of rescuing hostages.

329
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,375
I need people who are gonna get in there
to conquer territory, not to save lives.

How many civilian casualties
are we talking about?

Well, if I were you,
I wouldn't count on more than...

I'm informed about every detail.
They're outside if you wanna meet them.

345
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,583
I reached out to them
when the Professor started dropping money.

346
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375

You got two people injured here.

Yeah, but I saved another four,

They're both fathers.
They both have families.

It wasn't my fault.
It was that Goddamn recoil.

It's just collateral damage.

We can't cover this entire corridor
with two fucking clips.

For fuck's sake.
We gotta blow one of the charges.

If you blow the arsenal from the inside,
the entire building will collapse.

They're putting on a show.

They're throwing firecrackers
so we change our strategy.

511

It's battle rifles. Windows have been hit.
There are civilians in there.

Are you setting up
an intervention behind my back?

- What if I was? Would that be a problem?
- This is a civil conflict.

I demand to be part of any intervention.

You demand?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

to this one, this fucking disaster!

I'm doing this because I'm a good person.

[machine clicks]

796
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,791
We have no chance
of beating them if we leave.

797
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,250
Listen carefully
because I'm not gonna say it twice.

798
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,791
They're counterattacking,
you heard them yourself.

799
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:58,791
They have more weapons.

[tense music plays]

801
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,750
As soon as they bring them here,
this will turn into a rattrap.

802
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,166
We'll be totally fucked!

[metal rattles]

805
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,833
I already told you, let's act now.

806
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,166
Right now!

807

[frenetic music plays]

809

They're not covering the windows.
We can't wait any longer.

810
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,250
We have to go in right now, let's go!

Open!

822
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,000
[Lisbon] Shit!

823
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:39,208
I'm out of ammo!

[Stockholm grunts]

825
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,083
Arturo!

[Stockholm pants]

828
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,375
Mónica...

829
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,250
Calm down.

830
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,208
Huh? [pants]

831
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,666
[Stockholm] Don't move or I'll kill him!

832
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,875
On your knees!

833
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,041
Come on, get down.

834
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,851
[Arturo] Don't do
something stupid you're gonna regret.

835
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,625
[pants] Put the gun down, please.

[gun cocks]

837
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,416
'Cause you're not gonna shoot me,

838
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,083
right?

839
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,208
You would never shoot
the father of your child.

840
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,708
Do you know how I know?

841
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,541
I'm the only one who will
be able to be there for your child

842
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,291
when this thing is all over.

- The only one who's not gonna shame him.
- Lie down on the floor!

Don't you understand? [pants]

Don't you realize it?

846
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,041
Stop trying to be someone you're not.

847
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,666
You'll never be one of them.

848

- You'll always be a secret...
