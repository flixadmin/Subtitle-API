1
00:00:00,954 --> 00:00:03,562
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:06,496
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,082
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:11,417
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,705
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:20,093
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:24,130
I must be something else.

8
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:26,983
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,718
This is my daughter, Helena.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,436
When her father
killed her fiancé,

11
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:32,555
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

12
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,607
My father doesn't deserve
a second chance--

13
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,409
a second life.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,396
This is about
learning to control your strength.

15
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,618
Ollie, it's over!
We got to get off this ship!

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,298
Hugo mannheim.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,583
Warrants out for racketeering,
extortion, murder--

18
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:02,135
the goombah trifecta.

19
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:04,470
But he never travels alone,
so watch your back,

20
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:06,356
watch your partner's back.

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,057
Let's go.

22
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,266
Thanks for helping me
keep watch over my dad tonight.

23
00:01:17,268 --> 00:01:22,405
As long as Slade's out there,
neither of our families are safe.

24
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,210
This is the SCPD!
Put your weapons on the ground!

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,545
Move, move, move!

26
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:49,766
Aaah!

27
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,649
Freeze!

28
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:19,095
Go. Go!

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,950
Frank Bertinelli...

30
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,519
My daughter
sent you to kill me.

31

33
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,603
Hey.

34
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:18,805
Dad, are you all
right? Are you hurt?

35
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,573
Yeah, I'm fine,
sweetheart.

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,191
Listen, I know you don't
exactly believe

37
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,810
in reading perps
their Mirandas,

38
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,862
but you can't just toss a guy
out of a window.

39
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,113
He shot you.

40
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:28,614
And I'm still
here, ain't I?

41
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,700
Just next time, show
a little restraint.

42
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,535
That was me
showing restraint.

43
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,338
Detective.
We have another problem.

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,123
Yeah, I know.
With Frank Bertinelli in custody,

45
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,842
it's just a matter of time before
She-Ro is back in town.

46
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,911
Who is she?

47
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:44,263
Helena Bertinelli.
Daughter of mafia boss Frank Bertinelli.

48
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,966
Or as I like to call
her, Oliver's psycho ex-girlfriend

49
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,634
hell-bent on revenge
against her father.

50
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,553
Ex-girlfriend?

51
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,472
That's what you took
from that sentence?

52
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,941
Wait, why does
she want her father killed so badly?

53
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,476
He had her fiancé
murdered.

54
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,811
She wants payback.
Puts the many fights

55
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,029
I've had with
my father in perspective.

56
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,280
I've been
keeping tabs

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,698
on Helena over
the past year.

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,233
Last known sighting
was a month ago,

59
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,202
Palermo.

60
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,488
She's been busy.
If by "busy,"

61
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,957
you mean torturing
and killing mafiosos

62
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,458
that might know
where her father is.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,377
Bertinelli's arrest
just hit the wires.

64
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,663
How long do you think we have
before Helena books a ticket back home?

65
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:32,562
Go ahead.

66
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,896
Slade, please--

67
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,932
Aah!

68
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,601
Why aren't we moving yet?

69
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,853
We managed to repair the hull.

70
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,905
But the engine is too damaged.

71
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,775
So fix it.
I can't.

72
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,695
I don't know how!

73
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,081
Then find
somebody who does.

74
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,536
Hi, my name's Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

75
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:58,004
Hi, Laurel.

76
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,291
And this is actually
my second meeting today.

77
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:05,178
It's just, uh...

78
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,014
It's just so hard,
because I don't know

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,466
what to do
with myself all day.

80
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:13,769
I'm a lawyer,

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,506
well, I...
was...a lawyer.

82
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:20,443
I loved it.

83
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,178
But I guess I loved
drinking more.

84
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,532
I know that I can make it down here
with all of you.

85
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:31,237
I just...I'm not
sure I can make it out there.

86
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:34,574
Anyway.

87
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:37,293
Thank you for
letting me share.

88
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,386
Thanks for coming.

89
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,839
Sorry about the way
things ended here.

90
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,642
No, don't be.

91
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,727
You did me
a favor, Adam.

92
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,680
It was the only way I was going
to hit bottom,

93
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,515
and...

94
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,567
And I did.

95
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,052
How about you do me
a favor now...

96
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,820
come back to work.

97
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,989
You want me back?

98
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,942
I'm looking for someone
to try this case that just came in,

99
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,812
and honestly, yours was
the first name that came to mind.

100
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:15,414
I'm still facing sanctions
from the bar.

101
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,699
Oh, I got a buddy
on the disciplinary committee.

102
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,167
I squared things for you.

103
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,537
An SCPD raid last night
brought in Frank Bertinelli.

104
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,007
He came back to Starling
to collect on some old debts.

105
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,096
Now, the DA's office
is clear to prosecute him;

106
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,262
for you to prosecute him.

107
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,797
I appreciate the offer, Adam,
but why me?

108
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:33,215
Well, there are Rico counts
that your time at CNRI

109
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,017
make you ideally suited for.

110
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,055
Laurel, it's a case.
If you want it, it's yours.

111
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,256
But only if you're ready.

112
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,566
What's the special occasion?

113
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,068
I got paid.
So, you know,

114
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,536
if you don't think
it's nice enough,

115
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,654
you only have
yourself to blame

116
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:56,539
for not giving me
that raise.

117
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,159
Oh!

118
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,827
Roy, I love it.

119
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,048
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,834
Hey, give me--
give me a second,

121
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,119
I forgot to put
an order in.

122
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:12,955
Ok.

123
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,957
Hey, what's going on?

124
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,259
I got a line on Michael Statton,
Helena's fiancé.

125
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,461
Felicity, he's been
dead for five years.

126
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:21,230
Which makes the fact that he rented
a car last night very impressive.

127
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,682
That's Helena.

128
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,517
The car's got GPS,
I hacked into it.

129
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,270
Yeah. She's heading
straight for Starling City.

130
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,073
You ready to get
back in the field?

131
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,409
I thought you'd never ask.

132
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,922
It's over, Helena.

133
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,791
Get out of the car!

134
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,939
Gun!

135
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,151
Aah! Don't hurt me!

136
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:17,453
Stand down.

137
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,906
Stand...Down!

138
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,743
Don't hurt me!
Speedy!

139
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,161
Enough!

140
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,467
He's just
Helena's decoy.

141
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,004
Where is she?

142
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,806
I don't know!

143
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,708
Some chick just paid
me to take the car for a joy ride.

144
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,877
I swear!

145
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,483
Please don't kill me.

146
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,718
I'm getting married
next month.

147
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:53,272
Just drive.

148
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,162
According to the SCPD,
the guy that gave Helena

149
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,898
a ride into town is a 22-year-old
Poly Sci major at SCU,

150
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,399
and a member
of Gamma Tau,

151
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,284
which totally
explains the whole

152
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:11,937
"I didn't know I was aiding
and abetting a known felon" thing.

153
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,456
Anyone with boobs can get
a frat boy to do anything.

154
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,208
I was a frat boy.
I rest my case.

155
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,243
At least she didn't kill
him. That's something.

156
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,663
It's not like Helena
to show restraint.

157
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,773
It sounds like
you have a type.

158
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:24,026
Keep tabs on the police.

159
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:26,111
Let me know if they get
any leads on her.

160
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:29,121
I'll do some canvassing.
Hey...

161
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,898
You ok?
Yeah.

162
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,734
By this time tomorrow,
it'll be like nothing happened.

163
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,352
That's one upside
to Mirakuru.

164
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,688
The only one.

165
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,673
Look, I know what
you're going to say.

166
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,491
I had it under control
last night.

167
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,077
Yeah, so under control that I
almost put another arrow in you.

168
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,996
I was going to back off,
but you never gave me a chance.

169
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,280
The only thing that
snapped you out of it

170
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,416
was when
I brought up Thea.

171
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,535
That's why
you called me Speedy.

172
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:02,871
I--I thought you were
trying to give me a nickname.

173
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:04,707
But for the record,
don't call me Speedy.

174
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,092
Noted.

175
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:11,096
Roy, you're dangerous.

176
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,266
I thought I was
helping you control it.

177
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,435
You are. I mean, I can't look at
a bowl of water without slapping it.

178
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,223
The first time that you're out in
the field in weeks,

179
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,309
and...you're ready
to kill somebody?

180
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,612
Come on.

181
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:31,650
I'm sorry, I should have asked
you to do this months ago.

182
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,652
Asked me to do what?

183
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:36,405
Stay
away from Thea.

184
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:40,826
No, I--I can't.

185
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:42,828
She's not safe when
she's around you.

186
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,198
I'm not sure anybody is

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,668
when you lose
yourself to this rage.

188
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,137
You love her.

189
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,975
And that's why you're going to do
what I'm asking.

190
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:00,929
Such a big uh-oh.

191
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,380
Helena?

192
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:03,882
Laurel.

193
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,550
Ada Adam Donner

194
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,986
announced the return
of Laurel Lance to the DA's office

195
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,738
after a brief sabbatical.

196
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,441
She will lead the prosecution
of Mr. Bertinelli.

197
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,393
Jury selection starts today.

198
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:20,165
Hey.

199
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,417
Hey. What are
you doing here?

200
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,003
I heard you picked up
some big new case on the news.

201
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,505
How come you didn't call me?

202
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,091
I was going to, but it
all happened so fast.

203
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,627
Plus, I thought you and dad
would try and talk me out of

204
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,463
going back
to work so soon.

205
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,549
Which is why
you're here.

206
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,218
I'm just worried about you.

207
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,853
If you're worried
I'm going to slip,

208
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,388
I'm still going to two meetings
a day, and--

209
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,858
Laurel, it's not that.

210
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,694
Everybody knows
what kind of guy Bertinelli is.

211
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,780
And not to mention
his completely psychotic daughter,

212
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:54,399
who's already on her way back
to Starling City to kill him.

213
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,034
How do you know that?

214
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,654
I don't.

215
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:01,039
I just want you
to be safe.

216
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:06,161
And I love you
for caring.

217
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:09,581
But Sara, you've never seen me be
a lawyer before.

218
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,117
And I am really
good at it.

219
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:15,170
And I miss it.

220
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,306
I have to run.

221
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:19,791
I can't be late
for court.

222
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,902
Yeah, this is much better
than the freighter.

223
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:33,972
You prefer boat, Hendrik,
feel free to swim back.

224
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,742
Sara said Oliver
survived here for over a year.

225
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,076
We can do the same.

226
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,863
Unless Ivo and his men
come find us.

227
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,781
We don't know
what happened on the boat.

228
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,868
Who's alive
and who's dead.

229
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,871
Sara, are you there?

230
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:52,791
Slade! Is Oliver...

231
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:55,294
He's in pain, yes.

232
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,597
But he's still
breathing--for now.

233
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,183
Slade, listen, you won, ok?
You have the "Amazo."

234
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:05,103
Just let Oliver go,
and then you can leave us here!

235
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,672
Well, here's
my problem, Sara.

236
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,691
I can't leave.

237
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:12,144
Why not?
During our assault,

238
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,729
the ship's engine
was damaged.

239
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:15,530
She won't sail.

240
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,233
During the attack,
unfortunately

241
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,736
I decapitated
the engineer.

242
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:24,174
So what can we do
about our problem, Sara?

243
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:25,859
You want Oliver back,

244
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,896
and I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

245
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,065
For Oliver's sake,
I sure hope

246
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:34,235
a Mr. Hendrik
is there with you.

247
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:40,541
Non-lethal arrows?

248
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:44,295
It's not like you
to play with kid gloves.

249
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:47,548
How's Roy?

250
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,134
Like Helena, he is
not too pleased

251
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:52,803
with my skills
as a mentor.

252
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:56,423
Laurel won't drop the case.
She's headed to court right now.

253
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:58,425
Where are you going?
To the courthouse.

254
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:00,844
Well, hey,
you forgot

255
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,764
your baby arrows.

256
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:06,216
Look, I get your whole no
killing spree,

257
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,068
but if it comes down
to saving Laurel or killing Helena--

258
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,220
Sara, those aren't
the only two choices.

259
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:12,906
Well, you were happy enough
to let Dig take the kill shot

260
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,358
when it was Slade
threatening your family.

261
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,526
This is different.

262
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:19,113
I failed Helena.

263
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,282
I created the Huntress.

264
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:23,334
Yeah, well,
you created Slade, too.

265
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:31,908
You're right.

266
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,711
You're right.

267
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,296
But when it comes
to our families...

268
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:38,182
Neither one of us
thinks clearly.

269
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:42,419
Which is why you have
to stay here.

270
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,687
Ollie.

271
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,856
I can't.

272
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,642
I'm not going to let
anything happen to Laurel.

273
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:51,528
I love her, too.

274
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:02,105
What do you guys think?

275
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:05,275
Oh, I think if the Huntress shows up,
you should totally kick her ass.

276
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,670
Please don't tell me
you're worried about me, too.

277
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,672
No, I just wanted
to watch the trial.

278
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,008
I heard the prosecutor
was something special.

279
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:26,347
That's odd.
Why are they bringing him in

280
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,848
through the front
entrance?

281
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:35,072
Everybody get down!

282
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,746
Hi, dad.

283
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:46,750
Sorry I'm late, but you're a hard
man to track down.

284
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:49,319
But it's fitting
that you came back to Starling.

285
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:50,754
Where it all began.

286
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:52,790
Where you killed
Michael.

287
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,426
You know, I almost
feel sorry for you.

288
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,160
Helena...

289
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,013
Stop this.

290
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:02,433
Oliver,
you know I can't.

291
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,968
Well, what are you
waiting for?

292
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,273
I said, what are you
waiting for?!

293
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:14,561
Helena Bertinelli,
put down your weapons

294
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:16,613
and place your hands
above your head.

295
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,899
So this was
a big trap...

296
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,735
with you as the bait.

297
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,237
What did they offer you?

298
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,656
Ah, they didn't have
to offer me anything.

299
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:28,375
Give up, Miss Bertinelli,
the building's surrounded.

300
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:31,245
What was it you always
taught me, Daddy?

301
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,131
Be prepared
for anything.

302
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,595
Fall back, fall back!

303
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:00,441
Take hostages,
and fall back.

304
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:06,079
Hey, hold your fire, hold your fire!
They have hostages!

305
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:09,232
Hold fire. Say it again, hold fire.
They've taken hostages.

306
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,401
Where's Laurel? Where's Laurel?
Is she with you?

307
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:14,004
I'm sorry, Mr. Lance,
we got separated.

308
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:16,290
She's still inside.

309
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,113
We are live outside

310
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:29,333
the Starling City courthouse,
where Helena Bertinelli

311
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,967
and an unknown number
of assailants

312
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:33,052
seized control
of the entire building.

313
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,501
And I'm not being told,

314
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:36,985
they are holding a number
of hostages inside.

315
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,142
I want snipers
with thermals on top

316
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,227
of every building
for a two block radius.

317
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:44,063
This was not how it was supposed
to go down, Captain!

318
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:46,516
You promised me
there wouldn't be any casualties!

319
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:49,352
This was your idea, huh?
You son of a bitch!

320
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,070
Hey, my daughter's
in there!

321
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,572
What were
you guys thinking,

322
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,574
putting all those
innocent lives at risk?

323
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,993
Listen! I was following orders.
Orders?!

324
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,701
Ms. Bertinelli.

325
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,786
No one has
to die today.

326
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,137
My father does.

327
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,789
And unless
you hand him over to me,

328
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,125
I'm going to start
killing hostages.

329
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:17,246
See this,
Mr. Donner,

330
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,299
is what happens when you let
freaks with masks

331
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:22,101
run wild.

332
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,304
Get them the hell
out of here.

333
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,564
It's my mom.

334
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,817
Detective.

335
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,486
Helena Bertinelli
just took ten hostages.

336
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:41,904
Laurel's one of them.

337
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:44,106
Yeah, I'm aware
of the situation.

338
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:52,332
Oliver, where are you?
Are you ok?

339
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,968
I'm with Lance as Oliver,
and he just called the Arrow.

340
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,220
Oh. Oh!

341
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:00,089
It's getting really hard to keep track of
who knows whose secret identity.

342
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,891
Felicity, Laurel is still
inside the courthouse.

343
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:02,976
What do you
need, Oliver?

344
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,794
My work clothes.
I'm on it.

345
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,295
Put Sara on the phone.

346
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,897
Uh...

347
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:10,566
She's not here.

348
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,402
Where is she?

349
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,716
Are you one
of the good guys?

350
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,770
No, but I'm friends with them.

351
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,813
Dude, watch it.
Screw you!

352
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,495
Thea, we need to break up.

353
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,996
What?!

354
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,748
No.

355
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,199
What do you mean, no?

356
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,751
Thea, I'm breaking up with you.

357
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,336
No, you're not.

358
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,338
You can't make me date you.

359
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,474
Roy, yesterday
you gave me a bracelet

360
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,509
worth every dime
that you had,

361
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,261
and now what,
you want to end things?

362
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:31,981
Look, you're clearly going through
something right now,

363
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:34,817
and I'm not going
to let you go through it alone.

364
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,153
I'm always going
to be here for you.

365
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:40,106
Sorry, Thea. The guy
from the private party

366
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,658
said we stocked the wrong vodka,
and he's freaking me out.

367
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,695
Look, we'll talk
about this later, ok?

368
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,833
Oh!

369
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,586
Are you hurt?

370
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:13,756
I'm so stupid.

371
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:16,359
Hey.

372
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,693
You don't want
to do that.

373
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,395
Oh, no, trust me.

374
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:20,947
I do.

375
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,233
What about
your sobriety?

376
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:26,986
How do you know about that?

377
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:29,405
The "A" chip on
your keychain.

378
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,707
30 days.

379
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:38,948
Do you even know
why I'm here today?

380
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,918
Turns out I'm decoration.

381
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,620
Expendable decoration.

382
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:46,055
What do you mean?

383
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,424
This whole trial was a sham.

384
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,927
I should have seen it.

385
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,262
Sara was right.

386
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:55,231
Sara, she's...

387
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:58,434
She's my sister.

388
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:01,170
She said that I wasn't
ready to come back, and...

389
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:04,273
I just thought
she was being overprotective.

390
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,776
Well, sisters
can be like that.

391
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:08,411
You should
meet mine.

392
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:10,863
She's gone through a lot.

393
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:14,050
She must have been so strong.

394
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:16,285
I just...

395
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:19,705
I wanted to show her,
show myself...

396
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:23,325
That I was still strong, too.

397
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:28,764
So show me.

398
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:43,446
Let's go.

399
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,570
Where are you?

400
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,655
Inside. I've got
Laurel Lance, she's ok.

401
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:54,123
Is that the Arrow?

402
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,992
I'm headed to an egress point
in the south wing.

403
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,210
Wait.

404
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:59,378
What about
the other hostages?

405
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,163
You're just going
to leave them?

406
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,915
Look, I need
to get you to safety.

407
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,334
I don't understand! What
is so special about me?

408
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:06,886
What's going on?

409
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:09,805
She won't leave.
I know Helena.

410
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,374
She's going to kill
all of those people,

411
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,843
innocent people.

412
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:16,312
You wanted me to
show you I'm strong.

413
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:20,182
This is me being
strong. I'm staying.

414
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:23,352
Are you going
to help me or not?

415
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:26,989
Get her out of there now!

416
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:29,742
It's not like I can
just knock her out.

417
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,827
I don't want you
engaging Helena.

418
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:33,996
What, you're afraid
of what she'll do...

419
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,531
Or what I'll do?

420
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,400
Sara...You're not a killer.

421
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,003
I am what I need to be.

422
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,458
Sara, did you hear me?

423
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,242
I heard you.

424
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:50,346
Hendrik's not here.

425
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:56,636
There's someone
I'd like you to say hello to.

426
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,804
Don't give him
anything, Sara.

427
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,089
Ollie!

428
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:02,308
One last chance.

429
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,226
Oliver for Hendrik.

430
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:07,363
I told you! Look,
Hendrik, he didn't make it

431
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,282
to the island, he drowned.

432
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:12,935
To think it was only a year ago,
you were a little college girl,

433
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,704
fretting about boys.

434
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,322
What's your point?

435
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,440
You're not a good liar.

436
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,879
Slade!
Stop, please!

437
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,715
Look, he's
your friend!

438
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:29,719
That is the sound of electricity
surging through my friend.

439
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,721
Five milliamps,
to be exact.

440
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:34,340
Seven causes
cardiac arrest.

441
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:37,226
Aah!

442
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:41,063
Oliver just passed out with
six milliamps.

443
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,966
He'll be delivered with
the fatal blow of seven

444
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:45,989
in one hour if Hendrik

445
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:48,504
is not standing here
by my side!

446
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,307
There's no way
in hell I'm going back there.

447
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,702
I was almost married once.

448
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,512
It's been an hour,

449
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,165
and I'm a woman
of my word.

450
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,634
Just ask my father.

451
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:20,720
No, please!

452
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,649
Everything's going to be ok.

453
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:43,325
Behind you!

454
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,667
Oliver sure does like
to dress up his girls.

455
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,075
You all right?

456
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:19,862
Laurel! She's
still in there.

457
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,787
Nice to see you
again, Laurel.

458
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,012
Helena,
listen to me.

459
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,515
This has to end.
I agree.

460
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,767
And it ends with
my father in a box.

461
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,487
The police are never
going to hand over your father!

462
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:46,105
No, they won't.

463
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:48,140
That's why you're
going to do it.

464
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:50,142
Simple trade--

465
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:52,862
my father for Laurel.

466
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,537
Hey, guys?

467
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,072
We need more vodka.

468
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,503
Ok...

469
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,139
I'll get it myself.

470
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:36,661
Where are you taking me?

471
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:37,962
Safe house.

472
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,281
Listen, front's mobbed
with reporters.

473
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,383
Let's take Bertinelli
out the back.

474
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:43,835
Bring the van
around.

475
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:46,504
Ow! All right.

476
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:55,741
Whoa! What the hell?
Don't worry about it.

477
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,057
What's going on?
Just get in the van!

478
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,319
Hey!

479
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:59,987
Hey, hey!

480
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,522
SWAT's getting ready to
breach the courthouse.

481
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,657
Then we make
the trade now.

482
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,943
Listen, I'm not going
to lose any sleep over Frank.

483
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,061
But are you really going
to serve him up to his daughter?

484
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,364
No.

485
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:12,733
No one dies tonight.

486
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,921
Are you ok?

487
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,972
Everything's
going to be fine.

488
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:23,359
I said...no talking.

489
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,197
We talked that night.

490
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:31,617
You, Oliver,
Tommy, and I.

491
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,819
At dinner.

492
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:37,823
I remember you telling me
your fiancé was killed.

493
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm so sorry.

494
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,546
Does this make us
girlfriends?

495
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,949
No.

496
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:50,386
But I know what
it's like to lose someone.

497
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:52,938
Ohh.

498
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,007
Poor Laurel.

499
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,276
Did Tommy dump you?

500
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,929
No.

501
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:03,065
He died.

502
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:06,419
And I couldn't deal with it.

503
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,905
So I became a drunk.

504
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:13,025
Every problem I had,

505
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,111
I solved with a pill or a drink.

506
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,540
My friends and my family,

507
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,580
they tried to help me,
but I wouldn't let them.

508
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:24,536
You don't have
to do this, Helena.

509
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:27,206
It's not too late.

510
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,308
Yes, I do.

511
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,845
Because once you let
the darkness inside,

512
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,848
it never comes out.

513
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,824
Helena.
I have your father.

514
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,827
Hmm.

515
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,730
I want four men teams,
diamond formations.

516
00:29:51,732 --> 00:29:53,999
Move fast, shoot sharp.

517
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:57,420
One more thing--
vigilantes are not the law.

518
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,072
If they're wearing a mask,
they get a bullet.

519
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:02,458
Let's move out.

520
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:09,348
Hands up, Bertinelli!
Do it now!

521
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,052
Please don't
kill me! Please!

522
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:17,440
She--she told me--

523
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,860
she told me to wear it
or she'd kill me!

524
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,194
Where the hell is she?!

525
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:27,566
Don't look so scared, Laurel.
You might just live through this.

526
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:44,003
So you're just going
to hand me over to my daughter?

527
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:45,621
I thought you were
the good guys!

528
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:47,323
Shut up.

529
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,657
Remember all that
stuff I said about restraint?

530
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,293
Forget about it.

531
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:54,213
Hey.

532
00:30:54,215 --> 00:30:57,366
You can't stop someone like Helena
by becoming her.

533
00:30:57,368 --> 00:31:00,603
I'll do what I have to
to protect someone I love.

534
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,473
Hendrik, please,
put the gun down!

535
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,192
Why? So you can send me

536
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,943
back to that hell hole?
I don't think so!

537
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,395
It's not for any
of us to decide

538
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:11,347
who lives and dies.

539
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,533
But in Hendrik's case,
I'd be willing to make an exception.

540
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:17,570
I'm leaving.
Don't stop me.

541
00:31:17,572 --> 00:31:21,157
Good at talking,
but you will not kill me.

542
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,993
Let's find out.

543
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,217
Sir, we've got a ping off
Ms. Lance's cell phone.

544
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:32,635
She must still
have it on her.

545
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:33,919
Where?

546
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,305
A machine shop
at Gail Street and Simone.

547
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:38,341
Should we rally up there?

548
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:40,843
Negative.
Hold your location.

549
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,728
Yes, sir.

550
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,380
Sergeant,
keep this position.

551
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,432
Yes, sir.

552
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:59,528
Well, this is irony
for you, dad.

553
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,947
Didn't you have
Jimmy d'Agostino's body

554
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:05,034
buried under
the building next door?

555
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,953
I'm sorry, my girl.

556
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:11,207
Now you're about to die,
I'm sure you are.

557
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,659
No.

558
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:16,962
I'm sorry for that little girl
I used to take to ballet class.

559
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:20,683
Go on ski trips with.

560
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,852
The one I used to help
with her math homework.

561
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:26,272
Oh, she hated math.

562
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:29,275
Sorry that I caused her
so much hurt.

563
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:34,697
'Cause she brought me
so much joy.

564
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,732
Helena!

565
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,901
Don't kill him.

566
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,486
You can never
come back from that.

567
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:41,654
It's too late.

568
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:44,824
I'm already gone.

569
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:49,662
Bye, Dad.

570
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,498
Damn vigilantes!

571
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,451
You went above the law!

572
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:13,969
Last time this happened,
I threw you out a window.

573
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,638
I was holding back.

574
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,441
I won't do that again.

575
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:49,772
Hey.

576
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:08,324
No!

577
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:11,494
You're not a killer.

578
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:13,195
You don't know who I am,
Laurel, not really.

579
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,297
Then show me.

580
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,426
No...

581
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,602
It was supposed
to be me.

582
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,404
It was supposed
to me who did it.

583
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:41,190
All right, Bertinelli,
that's enough.

584
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,698
Go.

585
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,944
How did you
get in here?

586
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:09,985
My family makes a generous donation
to the policemen's retirement fund.

587
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:13,752
And every once in a while,
I get to call in a favor.

588
00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:16,171
Hmm. Maybe you could
ask them to send me

589
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:18,340
to prison
somewhere tropical.

590
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:23,145
You know, I thought
I'd feel different

591
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:27,415
now that he's dead,
but I don't.

592
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,019
And you always
told me that...

593
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,789
Killing him wouldn't
change anything.

594
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:37,309
You were right.

595
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:40,412
But I was wrong, too.

596
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:45,767
About what?

597
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,454
I thought I could help you.

598
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:52,541
Stop you from being a killer,

599
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:54,426
but...

600
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,881
I was just starting.

601
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:03,468
And I was a killer, too.

602
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,638
And what
are you now?

603
00:36:09,392 --> 00:36:11,676
I'm trying to be better.

604
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:19,150
It's so stupid,
but...

605
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:23,321
I keep thinking,
now that he's dead,

606
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:27,242
my father and Michael
are together, and...

607
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,327
I'm still here.

608
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:32,697
Alone.

609
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,968
You're not alone.

610
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,228
What are you doing to me?

611
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,898
In Roman times,

612
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,950
a criminal was branded

613
00:37:08,952 --> 00:37:11,503
to identify his crimes
to the world

614
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:16,407
and to forever remind
him of what he'd done.

615
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:23,798
Shado wore this
tattoo on her back.

616
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,303
Now you shall wear
it for the rest of your life,

617
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,555
however short
that may be.

618
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:38,163
Hello, Sara.

619
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:40,382
I hope you've made
the right choice.

620
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,233
Yes.

621
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:58,166
Look, on behalf of
the entire DA's office,

622
00:37:58,168 --> 00:37:59,884
I have to apologize.

623
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:03,221
Adam Donner's employment
here has been terminated.

624
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,590
Obviously we had no idea
what he was plotting.

625
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:07,158
I would hope not.

626
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,478
Unfortunately, Adam
was not authorized

627
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,597
to offer you
your job back.

628
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,649
I'm sorry,

629
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,135
but nothing
has changed.

630
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:22,290
Yes, it has.

631
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:24,242
Excuse me?

632
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:27,912
You are going
to rehire me, Kate.

633
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,615
Unless you feel like
explaining to the press

634
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,118
that your own assistant
district attorney

635
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,956
was the brilliant mastermind
behind tonight's hostage crisis.

636
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:41,259
Welcome back.

637
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:51,269
I have to say,
I am impressed.

638
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,322
I would have thought blackmail was
a little dark for you.

639
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,124
Someone recently told me,

640
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,960
once you let
the darkness inside,

641
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,563
it never comes out.

642
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,996
Hey.

643
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:22,834
What are you still
doing up here?

644
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:24,586
Thinking.

645
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:26,371
Crying.

646
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:28,706
Roy and I are...

647
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:32,677
What happened?

648
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:38,917
I caught him
with some slut.

649
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,804
Right over
there, actually.

650
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:46,491
I'm sorry.

651
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,360
He was doing it
to push me away,

652
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:52,030
which clearly
worked.

653
00:39:52,032 --> 00:39:56,367
I just...
I don't know why.

654
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,771
Why is it so hard
for everyone

655
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,173
just to tell
the truth?

656
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:05,643
I mean, Roy can't even
tell me the truth

657
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,813
of why he wants to
end things with me.

658
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:12,717
Mom, she...

659
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,086
She keeps all
of these secrets.

660
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,022
I mean, doesn't it...

661
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:21,493
Doesn't it feel like she's still keeping
something from us?

662
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:29,067
I don't know, Thea.

663
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:35,406
You're the only one
that doesn't lie to me, Ollie.

664
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:38,243
You're the only one
I know

665
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:42,213
who doesn't keep
secrets from me.

666
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,450
Just, I got to go.

667
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,919
Let me drive you.

668
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:51,589
No, I just want to be
alone right now.

669
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:58,930
Is she ok?

670
00:40:58,932 --> 00:41:01,232
She will be.

671
00:41:01,234 --> 00:41:03,518
Eventually.

672
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,189
You did good
tonight.

673
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:11,576
That's what heroes do, right?

674
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:49,147
It's a dangerous city.

675
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:52,317
You shouldn't be out
in the streets alone.

676
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,403
Mr. Wilson?

677
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:58,135
Please.
Call me Slade.
