But adults? I mean, you saw what happens.

636
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,510
Sometimes you get powers,
sometimes you get a freak,

637
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,387
sometimes you just explode.

638
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,389
Vought is trying to stabilise it,

639
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,893
so that you put the V
in any adult arm, anywhere, anytime,

640
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,770
you get a solid Supe, solid powers.

[speaking in French]

642
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,149
Okay, so...

643
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,860
a thousand more Supes?

644
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:21,655
Hundred thousand? Why?
Why would Vought do that?

645
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:23,990
It's gonna fuck up their movies,
their merchandising...

646
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,158
Look, they don't tell me.

647
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,828
They just make me burn the evidence.

648
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,122
Okay?

649
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,386
My, uh...

650
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:49,683
My best friend OD'd...

651
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,727
and I left to save him that night.

652
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,315
Why I didn't stop you.

653
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,193
You were at the party.

654
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,237
I was away for 30 minutes.

655
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,822
Came back, you were gone.

656
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:10,704
Did he live?

657
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:12,580
Your friend?

658
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,251
[speaking in French]

659
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:20,005
But I never saw him again, and...

660
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:25,135
Then he died a few months later.
Another overdose.

661
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,721
Are you serious? Frenchie, wh...?

662
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,598
Why didn't you ever tell us?

663
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,810
What difference would it make?

664
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,812
After all these years, man?

665
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,982
We would've let you off the hook.

666
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,197
What makes you think
I want to be let off the hook, huh?

Get this thing off of me!

It's okay.

That's his fucking dick.

677
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,043
Don't be so closed-minded.

I'm here.

686
00:49:55,618 --> 00:50:00,623
I just killed six subjects out there,
like a fucking Teddy Bear picnic.

687
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,126
What the hell happened?

688
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:12,427
Dr. Carlton got the propofol dose
wrong again.

689
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,346
So Cindy got loose,
freed some of the others.

690
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,473
I'm sure some of them got out
before lockdown.

691
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:18,641
Where is Dr. Carlton?

692
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:22,520
Uh, he was in the cafeteria,
and the hallway, and...

693
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,064
some of the walls.

694
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,242
Clean up this mess. I'm gonna go see
if anyone else got loose.

695
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,870
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,677

What'd they say?

699
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,776
Just needs a couple of days
for the cefazolin to kick in,

700
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,612
but he should be all right.

701
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:16,282
- We don't have a couple of days.
- Well, we're gonna have to risk it.

702
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,837
Jesus.

703
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:35,843
- What?
- Just... It's the kids' shampoo he uses.

704
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,470
I can smell it.

705
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,891
L'Oreal for Kids "Strawberry Smoothie."
I've seen the bottle.

706
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:44,727
Hateful shit.

707
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,648
And his Axe body spray? Oh.

708
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:52,068
I mean, that's how Vin Diesel must smell.

709
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:58,491
You know, every morning, he slathers
his bum with Creamy Desitin.

- No.
- I fucking swear to God.

711
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,619
He's got rashes down there.

712
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,371
I don't want to know that!

713
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,291
Fucking mental, that's all I'm saying.

714
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:17,927
But he really just
never gives up on you, does he?

715
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,137
Aye.

716
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:23,099
And he follows you around
like a right little pup.

717
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,354
He's too good for either of us.

Hmm.

00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:33,401
Yeah.

I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.
Where's your phone?

or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

I know I should've stood up to him.

for the things I've done.

You never asked to be saved.

You cannot absolve my sins, no one can.

755

Madame Mallory.

I know I wasn't welcome at the funeral,

765
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,305
so all these years,
I couldn't offer my condolences...

Where is he?

767

Why isn't this man restrained?

768
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:43,609
No need. I wanted to come.

769
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:46,237
I don't want to hear a single
goddamn word from you.

770

I thought this was behind me,

It never is.

Do it.

Besides you, no one wanted him dead
more than me,

It won't help you.

781
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,963
All you'd be doing is ending his torment.

782
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,971
You cannot punish him
as much as he punishes himself.

Trust me.

784

we do with him?

Hey.

I want to apologise.

Please, just let me explain.

Flap, flap, flap
goes that little mouth of yours.

790
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,056
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

791
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:41,185
Well, I've been thinking about that.

792
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,606
A lot.

793
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,276
I will never lie to you again.

794
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,905
I will tell you everything.

Your grandmother?

797
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:29,817
My daughter.

798
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:36,198
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

799
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,494
How old are you?

800
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,372
I was born in 1919.

801
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,124
In Berlin.

802
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,931
- Is that you with...?
- Heinrich Himmler.

803
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,434
He was a lovely dancer.

804
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,811
And that's Goebbels.

805
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:09,857
And the most important man in the room...

806
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,663
Frederick Vought.

807
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,544
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

808
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,215
He taught me everything.

809
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,928
And then we fell in love,
and he gave me a daughter.

810
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:43,474
He made me, and his genius made you.

811
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:57,780
Frederick didn't care about
all the fans or stardom

812
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,615
or any of that shallow bullshit.

813
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:03,953
We are in a war for the culture.

814
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:09,333
The other races are grinding us down
and taking what is rightfully ours,

815
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,043
but we can fight back.

816
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:15,548
With an army of supermen, millions strong.

817
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:20,010
Because that is Vought's true destiny.

818
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:24,515
And you will be the man who will lead us.

819
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:34,400
You are everything that we dreamed of.

820
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:40,406
So I love you with all of my heart.

821
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,034
How could I not?

822
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,085
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

823
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,921
And then I found you.

824
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,967
We found each other...

825
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:05,764
and now neither of us
has to be alone ever again.

826
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,978
And that is the truth.

827
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,702
