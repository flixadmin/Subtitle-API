1
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:24,233
<i>Thank you for being here with us,
with the groom and the bride.</i>

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,278
<i>Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.</i>

3
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,952
Congratulations.

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,227
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

5
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,812
How are you, sir?

6
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,446
Hello, Paco.

7
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,118
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

8
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,531
Will you tell me something?

9
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,580
- What happened to you over there?
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.

10
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,958
But you want to go back?

11
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,070
Sir, here you are.

12
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,197
Thank you.

13
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,343
FOR BEING FRIENDS WITH
PABLO ESCOBAR - LOS PEPES

14
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,495
<i>Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,</i>

15
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,914
<i>will now simply step up
its own drug production.</i>

16
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,637
Hello?

17
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,226
Yes. What's up?

18
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,522
Let's see.

19
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,547
- Palmira's police superintendent.
- Didn't we just take care of him?

20
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,633
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

21
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,385
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

22
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,054
Put 17.

23
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,306
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

24
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,059
Anderson! Move all that over to the left.

25
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,936
The tables are too close together.

26
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,528
Are you planning
on saying anything tonight?

27
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,825
- No.
- I'll speak for the both of us.

28
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,412
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

29
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,914
And?

30
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,542
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

31
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,212
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

32
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,801
You're more superstitious
than Aunt Luz.

33
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,955
- Hey, boss.
- Is everything ready?

34
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,252
It took all night, but it's ready, sir.

35
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,630
You can handle it, you're young.

36
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,890
We're meeting Córdova.
He wants to go over the game plan.

37
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,101
Big night tonight, right?

38
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Lots of company.

39
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,664
Gentlemen,
let's start with the obvious.

40
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,333
Tonight is fucking important.

41
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,838
The Rodríguez brothers never
gather members of their organisation

42
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,548
in one place.

43
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:58,260
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

44
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,430
So we have to be sharp.

45
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,641
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

46
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,686
- Jorge.
- Stayfocused.

47
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,188
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

48
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,566
Tonight is his last operation.

49
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,946
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

50
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,492
Let's leave a good impression.
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

51
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,829
Let's go.

52
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,672
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

53
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,217
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

54
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,138
I have no idea.
After Friday, it's not my problem.

55
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,058
- Are you really leaving?
- I promised Paola.

56
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,439
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

57
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,234
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

58
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,987
I hope so, buddy.

59
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,115
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

60
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,929
Who am I speaking with?

61
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,183
This is Andres, his brother.

62
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,396
And how can I help him?

63
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,331
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

64
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,544
Something to drink?

65
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,429
Relax. You're safe here.

66
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,642
Let's talk about tonight's party.

67
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,394
We need info on the people attending.

68
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,480
Cops, politicians.

69
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,357
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

70
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,569
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

71
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:53,370
Look, the thing is, these people
never get together in one place.

72
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,164
We need to know why now.

73
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,583
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

74
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,921
is making some kind of important
announcement, understand?

75
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,740
Come in.

76
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,752
We were getting worried.
Everything OK?

77
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,213
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

78
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,384
I had to make sure I was alone.

79
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,681
Take off your shirt. Sit.

80
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,534
Look, don't you think you should
fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

81
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,706
He's a boss.

82
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,750
We're in their territory, right?

83
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,048
Yes.

84
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,134
I'll fix it tonight.

85
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,760
María.

86
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,186
For our children,
and our children's children.

87
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,814
That sounded great, brother.

88
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,900
Let me do it from the top.

89
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,279
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

90
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,367
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

91
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,288
What's up?

92
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,041
Look at you. How's New York?

93
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,170
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

94
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,423
I brought you something, baby-face.

95
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,683
It's been too long
since we were all together.

96
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,023
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

97
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,110
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

98
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,280
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

99
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,117
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

100
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,663
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

101
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,167
Cheers, then! To the Pope!

102
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,296
Welcome, Chepe.

103
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,510
Look, Gilberto...

104
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,764
you know I have a personal issue

105
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,309
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

106
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,772
And he's downstairs.
I would like to solve it.

107
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,068
OK, Pacho.

108
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:22,740
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

109
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,368
There's too much at stake.

110
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,790
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

111
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,794
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

112
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,213
Chepe, you motherfucker.

113
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,902
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

114
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,198
I pay him money every month.

115
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,868
I pay all these people.

116
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:11,247
Well done, big shot.
It's not your money.

117
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,207
But I'm the one who controls it.

118
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,752
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo, enough.

119
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,046
Sure, you're turning into Al Capone.

120
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,427
Watch it.

121
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,277
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

122
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,279
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

123
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,824
Yes.

124
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,243
Nice to see you.

125
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,246
Don Gilberto, good evening.

126
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,166
- Welcome, Mr Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

127
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,128
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

128
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,054
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

129
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,776
Hello.

130
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,820
- Good evening.
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

131
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,072
- Of course.
- Thank you.

132
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,093
Are you...

133
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,304
enjoying yourself?

134
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,932
Yes. Very much, thank you.

135
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,191
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

136
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,193
María Salazar.

137
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,154
Thank you for having us.

138
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,968
Good evening.

139
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,803
Mister Rodríguez would like
for his associates

140
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,930
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

141
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,849
Please, go right ahead.

142
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,313
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables. Thank you.

143
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,861
Stop there.

144
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,072
You must be using
some high-end equipment

145
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,325
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

146
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,952
Who are you?

147
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,580
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

148
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:01,459
See that man over there?
His name is Navegante.

149
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,669
Guess what he does?

150
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,591
Either you come with me,
or you go with him.

151
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,134
You understand?

152
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,638
Follow me.

153
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,865
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

154
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,993
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

155
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,621
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

156
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,291
Your brother is Lucho.

157
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,711
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

158
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,214
That's why you agreed to work
for the DEA.

159
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,966
Don't lie to me.

160
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,969
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

161
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,514
But I think you're smart enough
to realise that.

162
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,060
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

163
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,521
Leave Cali.

164
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,401
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

165
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,778
I need you to disappear.

166
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,994
Associates, friends.

167
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,955
Our enemy is dead!

168
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,626
Our business is strong!

169
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,921
Together we have taken this business

170
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,466
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

171
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:39,265
But friends, there are circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

172
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,025
<i>Listen to me.</i>

173
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,237
<i>The law enforcement spotlight
will shine brightly on us</i>

174
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,906
<i>as it once did on Escobar.</i>

175
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,910
<i>And so, while we celebrate,</i>

176
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:05,041
<i>they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.</i>

177
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,212
An American named Joseph Kennedy

178
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,257
made his fortune
selling bootlegged liquor,

179
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,968
but he turned that money
into legitimacy.

180
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,220
His children, great politicians.

181
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:22,350
And one of them was even
elected president.

182
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:27,396
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

183
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,608
and soon we will reach an agreement.

184
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,827
Our organisation, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

185
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,416
We will surrender our labs,
our safe houses,

186
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,794
and our trafficking routes.

187
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,217
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

188
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,970
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

189
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,306
Our money will remain ours.

190
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,810
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

191
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:10,481
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

192
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,151
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

193
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,532
we'll give each of you a juicy share

194
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,660
of the final profits from this year.

195
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,920
To the bright future
we'll all soon enjoy.

196
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,049
For our children
and our children's children!

197
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,096
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

198
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,681
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

199
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:48,018
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

200
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,523
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

201
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,195
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

202
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,300
- What would you like?
- Whiskey. Dry.

203
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:44,825
Six months...
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

204
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,954
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

205
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,712
And then what?

206
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,717
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

207
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,025
I love you, brother.

208
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,905
I'll see you on the dance floor.

209
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,760
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

210
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,303
Because it's time, OK?

211
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,848
- Why are you treating me like this?
- That's enough!

212
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,891
Get in the car.

213
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,879
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

214
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,298
Very good, sir.

215
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,802
Do you think we surprised them?

216
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,514
Yes.
I think you surprised many people.

217
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,104
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

218
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,151
Don't be modest.

219
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,947
Córdova told me.
That's your talent.

220
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:51,160
Spotting the threat, knowing
when they're going to fuck us.

221
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,413
It's priceless.

222
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,211
I'm told you want to leave.

223
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,635
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

224
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,348
I'm starting my own security firm.

225
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:18,354
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

226
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,942
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

227
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,862
You have done great things for us
over the years.

228
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,490
For my family. For me.

229
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,870
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

230
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:48,884
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

231
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,595
Arrangements can change.

232
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,392
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

233
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,230
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

234
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,817
It's only six months.

235
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,989
Can I count on you, Jorge?

236
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,825
Yes?

237
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,998
Of course, boss.

238
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,499
Miguel.

239
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,957
The same.

240
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,892
Thanks.

241
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,687
Hello?

242
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,982
Hello? Who is this?

243
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,927
NATIONAL POLICE

244
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,162
Who am I speaking with?

245
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,388
- Juan.
- Here it is, sir.

246
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,931
Thank you.

247
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,824
Don Gilberto.

248
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,202
This just arrived.

249
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,004
Play them.

250
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,680
<i>Subject's name: Dîaz.</i>

251
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:18,435
<i>Recorded at El Nacional Hotel.
Room 117.</i>

252
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,898
<i>Retirement works
for these motherfuckers. They're rich.</i>

253
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,400
I just bought a brand new plane.

254
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,111
So that motherfucker Gilberto
can shove it up his ass.

255
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,657
<i>Besides, who are they to make a deal
without consulting with us?</i>

256
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,410
<i>They don't get to surrender
on our behalf.</i>

257
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,788
That son of a bitch Díaz.

258
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,542
I'll send Navegante.

259
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:47,923
<i>Subject's name: Santos.
Recorded in zone 4.</i>

260
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:53,887
They're going to have to give me more
than that fucking wrapping paper.

261
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:59,309
Fucking balls on the old goat
to tell me how to run my business.

262
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:03,772
That's not going to be so easy.
These men are weak.

263
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:08,693
I'll handle that one myself.
The man is an animal.

264
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:12,072
<i>Subject name: Beltre.</i>

265
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,243
I'm not going to wait for Rasguño
or Henao to snatch the good territories.

266
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,246
Let's organise so we can
put a move together now.

267
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:23,208
Fuck Joseph Kennedy,
whoever that asshole is.

268
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,755
Córdova...
El Pecas will handle that one.

269
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,465
You got it, sir.

270
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,596
<i>Subject name: Salazar.</i>

271
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,475
<i>Marîa, I'll be back soon.
I'm going out with some friends.</i>

272
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,228
<i>What do you mean, Claudio?
You're going out now?</i>

273
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,232
Please don't look at me like that.

274
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,192
It's one o'clock in the morning.

275
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,236
Exactly, María. It's one o'clock.

276
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,197
Keep your voice down
so you don't wake the guests.

277
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,992
Fuck off, Claudio.
Go with your whores!

278
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,660
Don't fuck with me, María,
because I'm tired

279
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:02,038
from clapping all night
for that motherfucker's bullshit.

280
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,250
<i>Don't fuck with me.</i>

281
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:17,887
Well... that's husband and wife business.
Leave him out.

282
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,349
No, brother.

283
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,105
Salazar shows no respect.

284
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,193
Better safe than sorry.

285
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,694
Honey. What time is it?

286
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,821
It's late.

287
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,658
Go back to sleep.

288
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,576
How was work?

289
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:22,994
Fine.

290
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,209
I spoke with Miguel.

291
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,005
And?

292
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,512
He asked me not to leave.
Just for a little while.

293
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,972
How long?

294
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,018
I'm asking you how long.

295
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,562
- Six months.
- Six months?

296
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,149
What did you tell him?

297
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,987
What could I tell him? It's six months.

298
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:01,825
We've talked about this
for a long time.

299
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,913
You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

300
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,917
You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

301
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,378
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

302
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:18,174
You like working for them.
It's become your life, Jorge.

303
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:22,095
You are my life.
The girls are my life.

304
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,265
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

305
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,601
- It's six months, not six years!
- Not another word.

306
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,996
- She owns a spa.
- Let's go. We should go!

307
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,581
What can I get you?

308
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,543
A bottle of aguardiente,
and play <i>Dos Gardenias</i> for me.

309
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,127
Gladly, Don Pacho.

310
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,047
Thank you.

311
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,270
Please, Claudio...

312
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:40,608
accept this as a token of respect.

313
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,903
To let bygones be bygones.

314
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,286
You know what, Pacho?

315
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:57,166
I think our differences are in the past.

316
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,425
I'll be right back to share it with you.

317
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,844
- Excuse me.
- Please.

318
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,154
- Claudito.
- And now... the bottle.

319
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:32,822
Go ahead.

320
