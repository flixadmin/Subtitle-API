00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,727
[Courtiers murmuring]

325
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:47,232
lf you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.

326
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,776
l understand the law.

327
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,614
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

328
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,866
Life is more elegant here.

329
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,368
Open the Moon Door.

[Robin giggling]

332
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,059
[Lysa] You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.

333
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,144
Very well.

334
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,730
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

335
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,565
and you will hear his judgment.

336
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,777
Then you will leave...

337
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,779
by one door or the other.

338
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,240
[Tyrion] No need to bother Lord Robin.

339
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,368
- l demand a trial by combat.
- [Laughter]

340
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,046
You have that right.

341
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,091
My lady, l beg the honour.

342
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,093
Let me be your champion.

343
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,512
The honour should be mine.

344
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,056
For the love l bore your lord husband...

345
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,766
let me avenge his death.

346
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,310
- l'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honour.

347
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,438
- The honour should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

348
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,650
Ser Vardis...

349
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,361
you're quiet.

350
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,572
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

351
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,326
With all my heart, my lady.

352
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,745
But the Imp is half my size.

353
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,207
lt would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

354
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,500
Agreed.

355
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,961
You demanded a trial by combat.

356
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,756
Now l demand a champion.
l have that right, same as you.

357
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,508
My lady,

358
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:39,553
l will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

359
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,806
l wouldn't be too glad, ser.

[Whispering]

362
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,646
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

363
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,232
Send a raven for him. l'm happy to wait.

364
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,277
The trial will be today.

365
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,824
Do l have a volunteer?

366
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,951
[Laughter]

367
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,626
- Anyone?
- [Giggling]

368
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,170
Anyone?

369
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,592
l think we can assume that no one is willing...

370
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,469
l'll stand for the dwarf.

371
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,149
[Lancel] More wine, Your Grace?

372
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,737
- What was l saying?
- [Renly] Simpler time.

373
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,990
lt was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

374
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,825
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

375
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,329
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

376
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,500
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

377
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,418
Nothing like today.

378
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,380
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

379
00:29:56,505 --> 00:30:01,218
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

380
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,345
[Laughing]

381
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,642
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

382
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,310
Once. l think.

383
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:14,106
You think? l think you'd remember.

384
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,109
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

385
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,237
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

386
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,989
and the Riverlands.

387
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,284
- We used to call it ''making the eight.''
- Those were some lucky girls.

388
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,369
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

389
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,329
l don't believe so, Your Grace.

390
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,164
[Laughs] Those were the days.

391
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,041
Which days, exactly?

392
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,628
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

393
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,798
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

394
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:42,843
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

395
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,305
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

396
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,432
Easy, boy.

397
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,560
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

398
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,145
l suppose it was all rather heroic.

399
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,981
lf you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

400
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,609
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

401
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,615
More wine, Your Grace?

402
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,052
[Man] They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

403
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,722
our fields, our granaries,

404
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,266
our homes.

405
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:35,312
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

406
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:39,775
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

407
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:43,111
They covered our children in pitch...

408
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,697
and lit them on fire.

409
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,951
Brigands, most likely.

410
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:54,039
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

411
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,417
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

412
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,796
lt's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

413
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,756
The king is hunting.

414
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:05,968
[Squelches]

415
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,262
[Groans]

416
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,975
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

417
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,813
[Whispers] Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

418
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,946
These men, were they flying a sigil?

419
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,826
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

420
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,328
The one who was leading them...

421
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,874
Taller by a foot
than any man l've ever met,

422
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:40,210
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

423
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:45,174
saw him take the head of a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

424
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,759
That sounds like someone we know.

425
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,887
The Mountain.

426
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,056
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

427
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,976
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

428
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,187
The man is an anointed knight.

429
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,356
l've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

430
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,609
l'm sure you have as well.

431
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:07,487
[Hushed] Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

432
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,239
for being angry with your wife?

433
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:16,413
lf the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

434
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,208
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

435
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,419
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

436
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,129
Well...

437
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:33,722
l cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

438
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:38,435
but perhaps l can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

439
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,730
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

440
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,903
You shall have the command.

441
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,281
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

442
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,200
As you command.

443
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,502
ln the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

444
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,504
King of the Andals and the First Men,

445
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:09,883
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

446
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:14,012
l charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

447
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,473
and all those who shared in his crimes.

448
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,268
l denounce him and attaint him.

449
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,435
[Murmuring]

450
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:23,856
l strip him of all ranks and titles...

451
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,984
of all lands and holdings...

452
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,236
and sentence him to death.

453
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:33,782
My lord...
This... This is a drastic action.

454
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,618
lt would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

455
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,121
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

456
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,498
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

457
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,918
lnform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

458
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,045
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

459
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:51,216
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

460
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,260
and a traitor to the realm.

461
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:10,944
[Softly] A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

462
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,447
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

463
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,992
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

464
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:21,038
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

465
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:25,334
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

466
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,128

[Speaks Dothraki] *Ammeni haz jolin!* Empty that pot.

642
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,245
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

643
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,629
[Viserys] No, Dany.

644
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,005
Dany, tell them.

645
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,549
Make them!

646
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:52,302
Dany, make them...

647
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,098
No, you can't!

648
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,684
Just... Please!

649
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,019
Dany, please!

650
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,316
A crown for a king.

651
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,945
[Screaming]

652
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,709
Khaleesi?

653
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,878
He was no dragon.

654
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,715
Fire cannot kill a dragon.

655
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:38,715
Gold in liquid form is not a fire Daenerys.
Sync, corrected & Dothraki dialogue by <font color="#3333FF">petala</font> for Subscene


656
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:49,715
Messed up for episode 1-5 for Dothraki dialogue. You can't read 
it because of { }, just delete it all for the dialogue to appear.
Episode 7-9 going to be loaded with Dothraki dialogue. *sigh*
