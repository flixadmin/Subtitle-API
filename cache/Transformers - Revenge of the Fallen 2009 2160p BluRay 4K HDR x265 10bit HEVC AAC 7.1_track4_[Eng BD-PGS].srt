It's just like a coach thing .

92
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,515
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad .

93

Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you .

Get the hell off the couch ,
you filthy beasts !

103

-What are you talking about, Dad?
-There's gonna be a lot of women there.

Yeah , well ,
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.

room to grow, okay?

108
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,269
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

109

Except we discovered
an alien race together.

110

How long you gonna be riding

Well , I am , okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you .

118
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,095
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

119
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,015
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

120
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,518
Yeah , I got you a webcam ,
so we can chat 24/7.

124
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,776
-Some mixes and candles and stuff.
-Sounds cute. I can't wait.

125
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,195
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

126
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,447
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

127
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,032
Yeah . Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.

128
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,159
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing .

129
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,871
-Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
-No, it's not that.

130
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,373
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high .

131
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,710
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

132
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,336
You really should come with me.

133
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,171
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

134
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,800
Well , that's not gonna happen
until I get my man-child father,

135
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,553
fresh out of prison , back on his feet.

136
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,930
I heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

137

Whisper it to me.

139

Wait, hold on . Wait, hold on a second .

143
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,740
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.

144
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,493
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,561
-What?
-I don't want to go anywhere with you .

154
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,813
I don't wanna go to France with you .

155
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,439
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you .

156
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,816
-I'm going back inside.
-All right, fine.

157
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,942
I'll call you from Paris.

158
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,831
What is all the racket?

159
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,915
Sam?

160
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,376
Dad !

161
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,842
-What was that?
-That's the whole kitchen !

162
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,431
-Bumblebee. . . Oh , my. . .
-Bumblebee !

163
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,870
-911 .
-Bumblebee !

164
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,873
-Get in the garage. Go !
-What the freak just happened?

165
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown .
J ust go in the garage quietly, please.

166
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,795
Holy Mother!

167
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,801
-Oh , my God !
-Whatever.

168
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,054
Get in the garage now!

169
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,228
-Firemen ! Fire fighters, over here !
-Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

170
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:59,024
This is it! Come on , you guys.
What are you waiting for?

171
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,698
My house is on fire !

172
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,204
-...very important.
-What happened?

173
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:17,000
Come here. Listen , I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

174
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,251
-What's going on?
-J ust take it.

175
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,253
-Sam Witwicky? A word with you .
-Yes, Mom . Yeah .

176
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,506
-H i , Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
-H i .

177
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,966
-An old furnace, I think.
-From a waffle iron .

178
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,595
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage !

179
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,348
J udy. . . National security.

180
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,976
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything .

181
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,396
J ust consider this
the official start of our remodel , okay?

182
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,525
Fine. If the government's paying ,
I want a pool and a hot tub !

183
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,069
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

184
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,284
-Yeah , you know you're in trouble.
-He still having voice problems?

185
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,787
He's playing it up.

186
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,957
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing , okay?

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,293
<i>I'm so excited and Ijust can 't hide it</i>

188
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,504
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.

189
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,341
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?

190
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,177
I meant to tell you about this earlier.

191
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,721
It's just that, you know. . .
Here's the thing .

192
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,015
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

193
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,102
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

194
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,980
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

195
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,442
I mean , you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

196
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,986
This is hard enough , man .
Don't make it harder.

197
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,446
Can you just look at me, please?

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,909
Come on , big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

199
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,329
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.

200
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,874
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

201
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,335
I just want to be normal , Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,

202
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,588
and I can't do that with you .

203
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,507
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you ,
you know, Bee.

204
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,386
Come on , don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

205
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,599
But you'll always be my first car.

206
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,144
Love you , Bee.

207
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,984
Wow!

208
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,237
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

209
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,822
-You got dirt all over you .
-Stop. Stop.

210
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,407
-What?
-Stop, I'm okay.

211
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,867
Look.

212
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,204
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

213
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,539
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

214
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,626
-And?
-And I'll do anything for you .

215
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,544
And?

216
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,714
-I think Sam's about to say the L-word .
-Let's go, kiddo !

217
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,882
N ice timing , Dad .

218
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,967
I adore you .

219
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,386
That's not the word that I want

220
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,888
-to hear right now.
-What are you talking about?

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,972
It's the same word as the other word .

222
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,891
-It's not the same word .
-Look, if I say the other word now

223
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,517
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything , plus

224
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,853
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

225
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,522
Yeah , but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

226
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:48,235
Yeah , well , so do girls.
Especially girls like you , with options.

227
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,489
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

228
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,159
-It can be.
-I hate that it's working .

229
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,995
Can I have a kiss?

230
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,831
We're going to make it work, I promise.

231
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,952
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

232
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,037
Retrieve it.

233
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,603
<i>Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.</i>

234
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,523
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through .

235
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,483
-Excuse me ! Excuse me ! Hello !
-No, I don't...

236
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,693
-Hold up.
-Those are nice.

237
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,403
Yeah , baby, it's upgrade time.

238
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,157
Yes, sir. Yeah !
Look here, it's my booty call right here !

239
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,119
-Time to get my sexy on with the green .
-Green? No, green is mine !

240
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,579
I call green !

241
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,042
-I got the green .
-That hurt, man .

242
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,294
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking .

243
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,765
Present arms !

244
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,531
Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around ,

245
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,116
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

246
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,786
I am now. Presidential order, Major.

247
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,789
I got a message
for your classified space buddies !

248
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,957
You guys made a mess of Shanghai .

249
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,339
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

250
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,592
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

251
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,971
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

252
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,664
<i>Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.</i>

253
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,750
<i>-General?
-Will, I saw the Shanghai op.</i>

254
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,336
<i>-We had a rough day out there.
-Yes, sir.</i>

255
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,297
<i>We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief</i>

256
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,591
<i>Now with your permission,
I can 't let you see him,</i>

257
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,052
<i>but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.</i>

258
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,178
Proceed .

259
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,449
You gotta wonder,

260
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,869
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

261
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,247
General , our alliance
has countermanded

262
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,958
six Decepticon incursions this year,

263
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,627
each on a different continent.

264
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>They're clearly searching
around the world for something,</i>

265
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:41,092
<i>but last night's encounter
came with a warning.</i>

266
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,845
<i>"The Fallen shall rise again."</i>

267
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,222
"The Fallen ." Meaning what?

268
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,726
Origin unknown .
The only recorded history of our race

269
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,980
<i>was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.</i>

270
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,648
Excuse me !

271
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,987
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed ,

272
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,616
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

273
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,993
<i>Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.</i>

274
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,038
<i>The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.</i>

275
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,707
Well , I guess I didn't get that memo.

276
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,795
Forgive the interruption , General .
Excuse me. Coming through .

277
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,256
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

278
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,551
After all the damage in Shanghai ,

279
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,597
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

280
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,895
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

281
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,526
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

282
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,530
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

283
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:47,200
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good .

284
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,161
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

285
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,288
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

286
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,915
in the field for two years.

287
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,293
We've shed blood ,
sweat and precious metal together.

288
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,088
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

289
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,798
Don't tempt me.

290
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,384
And the newest members of your team .

291
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,761
-Easy.
-I understand they arrived here

292
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,721
after you sent a message into space,

293
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,559
an open invitation to come to Earth ,
vetted by no one at the White House.

294
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:16,396
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

295
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,400
<i>And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team</i>

296
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,403
has always been above reproach .

297
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,322
<i>Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

298
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:31,953
<i>that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</i>

299
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,164
Now, what do we know so far?

300
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:41,671
We know that the enemy leader,
classified N BE One, aka Megatron ,

301
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,341
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

302
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,929
<i>surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.</i>

303
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:54,434
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

304
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,436
<i>is locked in an electromagnetic vault</i>

305
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,856
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

306
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,444
Decepticons, we have located the shard .

307
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,366
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

308
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,286
well , there's only one clear conclusion !

309
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,205
You ! The Autobots !

310
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,334
They're here to hunt you !

311
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,378
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

312
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,340
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

313
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,634
It sounds to me
like something's coming .

314
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:32,472
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

315
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,267
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

316
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,272
will you leave peacefully?

317
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:46,235
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

318
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:52,575
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

319
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:57,538
What if we leave and you're wrong?

320
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,090
That's a good question .

321
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,721
Oh , my gosh ! Look at this place !

322
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,849
I feel smarter already.

323
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,813
-Ron , can you smell it?
-Yeah , smells like $40, 000 a year.

324
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:26,401
-Hey, cheapo !
-Hey, go ahead . We'll get your stuff.

325
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,527
J ust go ahead and check out your room .

326
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,611
Yeah , go.

327
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,204
-Hey.
-Hey.

328
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,207
-You must be Sam , right? I'm Leo.
-Hey.

329
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,795
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

330
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,382
-That side.
-I already chose that side.

331
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,761
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

332
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,430
Yeah , see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

333
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,806
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

334
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,433
Balanced , unmedicated ,
nothing under the crawl space.

335
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,892
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

336
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,018
No criminal record , won't steal anything .

337
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,645
-Including girlfriends.
-Especially girlfriends.

338
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,981
-You got a girlfriend?
-I do. You?

339
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,443
No, not a chance. You a techie?

340
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,737
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

341
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,072
-Server's almost online, Leo.
-Network's up and running .

342
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,574
Beautiful , that's what I like to hear.

343
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,660
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my IT gurus.

344
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,872
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheReal Effing Deal .com .

345
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,206
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.

346
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,709
-No, I haven't.
-Well , that sucks.

347
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,252
-What is all this for?
-See where I'm going , bro.

348
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,255
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.

349
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,841
Kitten calendars.
That's where I started . Look at me now.

350
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,176
Got to have dreams, bro.

351
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,930
Leo ! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid !

352
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,975
Post it, baby! Go, go, go ! FTJ ! FTJ !

353
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,436
-What's "FTJ"?
-"Fuel the Jet."

354
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,854
Fuel the Jet, bro.

355
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,315
FTJ . FTJ , legit!

356
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,776
Did you see that? Did you see that?

357
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,320
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

358
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,781
Don't believe the hype, bro.

359
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,493
J ust like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

360
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,953
Yeah , I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

361
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,289
and they came down and toasted
this woman , and she was like...

362
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,333
-It looks fake to me.
-Dude, it's not fake.

363
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,503
The Internet is pure truth .
Video doesn't lie.

364
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,213
-It looks fake.
-No, man , I've seen them .

365
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,508
-They're, like, these robots. . .
-Look, look, it's fake.

366
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,092
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

367
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,220
And I wasn't there,

368
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,514
-so I can't comment or speculate.
-No.

369
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,808
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

370
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,852
No, listen , okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro !

371
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,646
-Which sack?
-The ball sack.

372
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,272
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

373
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,359
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

374
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,820
-It's aliens, man .
-Okay, okay.

375
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,154
Follow me.

376
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,240
Leo, bad news !

377
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,659
We just got scooped .
The video's already up on G FR.

378
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,244
Fassbinder!

379
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,664
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

380
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,791
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

381
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,377
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

382
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,838
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.

383
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,091
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

384
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,511
I work for you now? That's incredible.

385
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,514
It's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky Internet firm

386
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,642
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

387
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,686
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

388
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,312
That's your one warning patrolling ,
dude. Don't make me

389
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,022
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid ,
'cause I'll do it!

390
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,359
Hey, RA. Listen , it's getting a little
intense in my room . Can I switch out?

391
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,322
Sad face, 31 2. No switching , no trading .
Let's turn that frown upside down , okay?

392
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,490
-Oh , here we go.
-We made it. H i .

393
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:20,700
It's just like Hogwarts.

394
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,993
-H i .
-Is this co-ed?

395
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,369
This is a co-ed dorm .

396
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,912
-You guys want to meet my roommates?
-Yeah .

397
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,247
Some real swell guys.

398
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,707
-Here's Leo.
-We're the Witwickys.

399
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,875
-I'm Leo.
-I'm J udy.

400
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,751
Hey, you have a great son , you really do.

401
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,379
-Well , aren't you the sweetest thing?
-Yeah , he's real sweet, Ma.

402
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,630
What is that in your hand , by the way?

403
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:38,801
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having .

404
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,804
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

405
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,431
-Mom?
-Yeah , it's 1 00% pure,

406
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,141
Hawaiian green for the environment.

407
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,726
-How many of these have you eaten?
-Drop it.

408
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,728
-What is this?
-Yeah , they baked it with reefer in it.

409
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,187
-No, it's. . .
-Please, give me...

410
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,398
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

411
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad .

412
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,693
Please do something right now.

413
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,321
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want!

414
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,447
Come on , let's go.

415
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,032
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

416
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,953
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

417
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:08,998
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

418
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,500
Is. . . Is so nice...

419
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,963
Oh , my God . That's her. She's coming .
She sees me, she sees me.

420
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,634
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

421
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,427
Do not bird-dog my quail , you hear me?

422
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:25,765
Pretty girls ! Hey, you .
My son lives in this dorm .

423
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,018
You should go make friends with him .
He's Sam .

424
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,436
Glad she ain't my mama !

425
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,730
And he recently had his cherry popped !

426
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,108
He didn't know I was in the house !
I heard it all !

427
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,860
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Here he is !

428
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,489
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice !

429
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:47,453
-Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
-No, like the G PS. OnStar!

430
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,372
-OnStar.
-Frisbee !

431
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,501
No, Dad ! Dad , you just gonna
let her run around the school?

432
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,300
-Give it! Mine, mine, mine !
-Hey! Crazy!

433
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,552
-You want it?
-I want it.

434
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,056
J udy, J udy, just. . . J ust put it down .

435
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,517
-You gotta control your mother.
-I don't know who this woman is.

436
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,144
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.

437
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,106
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

438
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,067
-Did you get the booties? All right.
-Yes, Dad , I got the booties !

439
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,944
I'm upside down !

440
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,519
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

441
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,440
<i>We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.</i>

442
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,434
<i>Breach at B- 14.</i>

443
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,690
Go, go, go, go !

444
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,700
The shard's gone.

445
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,669
Contact!

446
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,046
Take it down !

447
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,298
-Which way?
-Shoot left!

448
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,472
Knock it down !

449
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,317
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

450
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,069
So, get your game faces on .

451
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,280
I can't stay long .
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend .

452
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,573
-That's so cool !
-No, it's not.

453
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,581
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

454
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,541
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on .

455
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,835
-Let's roll .
-She's hot.

456
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,753
Bro, we're hunting !

457
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,134
-See you , darling .
-Bye, Dad .

458
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,303
Okay.

459
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,603
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.

460
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm kind of nervous.

461
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,800
-Are you okay?
-No.

462
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,554
I was getting a napkin for my drink.

463
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,974
Thanks. Cheers.

464
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:21,060
-It's Sam , right?
-Yeah .

465
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,813
-I wanna dance.
-What, like. . . Like dancing?

466
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,983
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

467
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:32,863
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi . . .
I'm in a relationship, kind of...

468
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:37,284
-Relax. I just want to have some fun .
-Wanna have some fun?

469
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:41,372
Yeah , okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and ...

470
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,333
Oh , my...

471
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,045
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend

472
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,256
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?

473
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:03,519
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

474
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,939
There is a car on the lawn !

475
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:11,944
What are you doing?

476
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,529
<i>Houston, we have a problem.</i>

477
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,697
-What is it?
-Freshman !

478
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,282
-Yeah?
-Is that your car in our bushes?

479
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,244
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

480
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,038
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked .

481
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,748
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?

482
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,458
-What size shoe do you wear?
-Yeah?

483
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,544
-Hold on .
-You wanna try?

484
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,463
-I'll back it up right now.
-Get him out of here.

485
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:34,300
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

486
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,467
I've only known you 1 7 hours.

487
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,054
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

488
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:43,350
-I love Camaros.
-I can't do this right now, okay?

489
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,352
-Don't be a wimp.
-Oh , God !

490
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:57,990
-My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
-Yeah?

491
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:02,828
Fuel-injected .
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

492
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,206
We shouldn't stare...

493
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,793
I mean , share stories
with each other at all .

494
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,171
Come on , Sam . J ust one ride.

495
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,757
<i>Your cheatin ' heart</i>

496
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,012
Don't. Don't!

497
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,848
<i>She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky</i>

498
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,060
-Is your radio broken?
-No, my concentration is.

499
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,936
We're not cheating .

500
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,564
Not yet.

501
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,903
Is something wrong here?

502
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,076
God ! You okay?

503
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,038
<i>She's mighty, mighty</i>

504
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,416
I really don't know what to tell you .
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

505
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,633
Oh , God ! It's in my mouth !

506
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:00,052
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.

507
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,513
I got Wetnaps for your face ! Hold on !

508
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,681
I . . . I'm so sorry!

509
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,518
What are you doing?

510
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,533
You won't give me a day, huh?

511
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,412
-You won't give me one day in college?
-I'm sorry, Sam ,

512
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:29,832
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen .

513
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,750
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

514
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:35,879
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

515
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,757
but I'm here for your help, Sam ,

516
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,262
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

517
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,347
Perhaps they are right.

518
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:50,519
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

519
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,313
-This isn't my war.
-Not yet,

520
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,775
but I fear it soon will be.

521
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:00,404
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron .

522
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,657
Whole generations lost.

523
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,539
I know, and I want to help you , I do,

524
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,709
but I am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

525
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,586
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

526
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,047
I am where I'm supposed to be.

527
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,385
I'm sorry. I ...

528
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,138
I really am .

529
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,058
Sam , fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing .

530
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,687
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

531
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,941
We do, more than you know.

532
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:15,562
<i>Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,</i>

533
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,648
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

534
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,442
-What do you got?
-SU pulled five contacts at 5, 000 feet,

535
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:21,735
diving fast.

536
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,033
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

537
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,620
-Man battle stations.
-Chief of the watch , man battle stations !

538
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,580
Helm , left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

539
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,375
-Left full rudder, two-thirds.
<i>-Dive, go deep.</i>

540
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,774
The nets protecting N BE One
are screaming , sir.

541
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,736
That is 9, 300 fathoms down .
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

542
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,989
-None, sir.
-Then , people, we've got a problem !

543
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:21,295
Need parts ! Kill the little one !

544
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,887
The shard make Energon !

545
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:47,070
Conn , Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

546
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,531
-Sound collision alarm .
<i>-Left hard rudder.</i>

547
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,367
Five hundred feet.

548
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,370
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

549
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,589
-Collision imminent port side.
-One hundred feet.

550
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,715
Brace for impact.

551
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,286
Starscream , I'm home.

552
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:41,458
Lord Megatron , I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection .

553
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,712
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

554
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:50,676
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

555
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:55,097
After all , in your absence,
someone had to take command .

556
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,394
-So disappointing .
-Hatchlings ! Hatchlings ! Careful , fragile !

557
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:04,606
Even in death ,
there is no command but mine.

558
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:13,990
My master, I failed you on Earth .

559
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:19,705
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish .

560
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,169
You have much to learn , my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel .

561
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:29,881
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed .

562
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:34,553
-It can only transform .
-How is that possible?

563
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,223
It has been absorbed
by the human child .

564
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:43,353
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind .

565
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:47,065
Well , then , let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

566
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,610
And you will , my apprentice, in time.

567
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:55,991
For millennia, I have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

568
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:02,664
where I , too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.

569
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:10,338
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

570
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,050
Optimus ! He protects the boy.

571
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,429
Then the boy will lead us to him

572
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:23,018
-and revenge will be ours.
-Yes.

573
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:28,190
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

574
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,320
Without more Energon ,
the hatchlings will keep dying .

575
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:43,121
Space. Time. Gravity.

576
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,128
-Thank you .
-Finish that for me.

577
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,089
We're going on a journey together,
you and I , today.

578
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:58,178
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood .

579
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,015
And I shall be your consort, your guide,

580
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:06,102
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

581
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,941
Welcome to Astronomy 1 01 .

582
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,570
For what do we know about the stars?

583
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,533
Virgo, the virgin .

584
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,536
Orion , the great hunter.

585
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,249
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon .

586
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,668
No, they are dynamos

587
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:34,339
filled with a throbbing ,
savage and pent-up energy!

588
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:40,136
Behold the work of Albert Einstein ,
a professor once, like <i>moi.</i>

589
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,680
-Energy equals mass. . .
-What you doing?

590
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,223
Put your hand down .
Put your hand down .

591
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,725
Young man , there are no questions

592
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,769
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

593
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,189
I just finished your book and there's
only one problem . Einstein's wrong .

594
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,275
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

595
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,442
of light squared in this dimension ,

596
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,487
but what about the other 1 7?
Nobody ever talks about the other 1 7.

597
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,781
Clear example.

598
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,828
Break down the elemental components
of Energon ,

599
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,372
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

600
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,874
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

601
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:12,586
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an . . . Echo on its signal ,

602
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,629
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

603
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,131
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain .

604
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,508
Come on , guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

605
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:23,346
Young man , I will not be
punk'd in front of the dean .

606
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:28,101
No, this is my universe here.

607
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:33,565
Do you understand?
I am the alpha and the omega.

608
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,067
-Get out of my class !
-Yes, sir.

609
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,740
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

610
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:56,796
H i , Bones ! H i . H i .
You're such a good boy.

611
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,674
<i>What a good boy, you are.</i>

612
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,890
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

613
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,520
Come on , check that out.

614
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,191
There you go.

615
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,533
-Yes, Samuel?
-Hello? Mikaela?

616
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,203
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

617
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,081
-Something just happened to me, okay?
-What, you finally hit puberty?

618
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,791
No, no, no. Stop laughing .
This is serious. Okay.

619
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,584
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

620
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,461
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

621
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,631
Watch it, watch it, watch . . . No !
Okay, remember how I was telling you ...

622
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,008
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

623
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,134
Mikaela, okay,

624
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,303
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission , right?

625
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,972
And he saw Megatron .
Megatron zapped him ,

626
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,932
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

627
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,433
Well , now I'm seeing them , too.
Excuse me.

628
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,978
I just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

629
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,437
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

630
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,690
I am seeing symbols ever since I ...

631
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:01,903
-Since what?
-Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

632
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,989
-Do you have it?
-Yeah , I have it.

633
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:07,951
-It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
-Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

634
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,577
-Don't touch it.
<i>-I'm not gonna touch it.</i>

635
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,496
Sam , it's fine. It's locked away.

636
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,915
-No one knows where it is.
-I do !

637
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,753
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

638
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:22,924
There we go. Yeah , that'll work.

639
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,262
Damn it! Son of a bitch !

640
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,267
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

641
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,813
What the. . . This place is
a freaking house of horrors !

642
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,776
Pain . . . It hurts...

643
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,320
Hold on .

644
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,367
Right to five, then ...

645
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,879
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?

646
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,466
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

647
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,093
That's my eye, you crazy bitch !

648
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:11,389
-You gonna talk now?
-I seek knowledge from the Cube.

649
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,224
-The Fallen demands me !
-What knowledge?

650
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,935
You got the shard , I need the shard .
Give me the shard . I need the shard .

651
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,563
They're gonna whack me !
I'm gonna be dead without that shard !

652
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,733
Easy, warrior goddess,
I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone !

653
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,111
-And I'm your worst nightmare.
-Hey, hey, hey!

654
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:26,613
<i>-What the hell was that?</i>
-I'll tell you later,

655
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,239
just not on an open phone line, okay?

656
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,282
I'm gonna get on a plane right now

657
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,576
and I'll be there later this afternoon .
J ust be careful , Sam .

658
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,629
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

659
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,422
Yeah , a live bomb !

660
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:45,799
-No.
-Good .

661
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,106
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots !

662
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:04,984
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion .
Vicinity, eastern U nited States, sir!

663
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:08,071
-As in how many?
-U nclear, sir.

664
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,531
Well , get clear.

665
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,080
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

666
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,248
They're not answering our calls

667
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,916
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

668
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,211
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes !

669
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,255
Move it!

670
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,508
Let's go !

671
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,891
<i>Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

672
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,062
Alicia, <i>mi amor,</i> can I interest you
in an 1 8-inch Zookeeper's special?

673
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:43,648
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping .

674
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,775
Basically, I've got,
like, 1 8 inches of meat.

675
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,444
U nless you're vegetarian .
All right. It's cool . I am , too.

676
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:51,823
-Sam home?
-Sam? I think he died ,

677
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,199
but why don't we check?

678
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:55,160
-Here we are.
-Hey!

679
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,411
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? It's like

680
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,454
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

681
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:02,208
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

682
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,419
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

683
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,837
-kitten calendar. . .
-Dude, what the eff?

684
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,006
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

685
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,175
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head .

686
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,843
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good .

687
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,012
This is the part that...

688
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:18,892
Okay, what were you saying?

689
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:22,353
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

690
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:23,771
Get out.

691
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,690
Wait, wait, wait!
Can I just sit and watch?

692
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,901
I'll . . . I'll eat my pizza quietly.

693
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,904
Sam , I knew there was
something special about you .

694
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,280
Really?

695
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,909
And I know you know what happens

696
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,912
when two people in the know
get together.

697
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:42,290
They're genuinely amazing in bed .

698
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,585
Thank you .

699
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,379
All right, listen , hold on ! Boundaries.

700
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:53,551
-Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish .
-We have needs, Sam . Relax.

701
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:54,844
Jeez!

702
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:59,849
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

703
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,979
-You are very aggressive.
-J ust relax.

704
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,398
You want some turkey meatloaf?

705
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,696
Sam?

706
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,576
-Mikaela !
-Is that your girlfriend?

707
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,828
Ex.

708
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,998
Mikaela ! Wait!

709
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,752
I can explain ...

710
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,231
Sam , your bed buddy, Alice...

711
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,293
All right, come on .

712
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,919
-She's coming !
-She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

713
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,337
-Is this real?
-J ust run !

714
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,555
Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream !

715
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,348
I can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam !

716
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:23,808
-Look, it's not my fault, okay?
-It's not your fault?

717
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,310
Listen ! Listen , I'm a victim !

718
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:26,728
-You were a victim? Of what?
-Yeah .

719
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,646
-Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
-Of. . . Of molestation .

720
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,440
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

721
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,858
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth !

722
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,067
-I didn't! Look!
-You did !

723
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,653
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

724
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,906
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like. . . Like diesel !

725
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:42,327
-Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
-You're such a little girl !

726
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,329
We're gonna have
1 0 seconds of silence right now.

727
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,621
I'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.

728
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:47,540
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

729
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,168
I'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

730
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,461
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

731
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,296
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking .

732
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,173
-What were you gonna say?
-I hope you had a lot of fun ,

733
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,175
because this, this is over.

734
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,677
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

735
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,013
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

736
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,932
are gestating and hatching inside of you .
They're growing right now, probably!

737
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,810
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

738
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,020
Who are you?

739
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,190
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.

740
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,900
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

741
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:20,990
Whoa, guys, right there !

742
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:26,537
Run !

743
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,626
Mikaela !

744
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:51,396
Come on ! We gotta move !

745
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,648
It's a bomb !

746
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,158
You've got to get that box!

747
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,873
-This way.
-What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

748
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,752
Oh , my God , you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

749
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:17,046
Drive, drive, drive !
She's right there ! She's right there !

750
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,924
Come on , come on , come on .

751
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,677
Go ! Go ! Go ! Back up the car!

752
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,096
Now!

753
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,015
Tongue !

754
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,313
Oh , my God !

755
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:43,322
Kiss this, bitch !

756
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:50,580
Drive, drive, drive.

757
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,584
Okay, so what else
don't I know, all right?

758
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,377
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

759
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,091
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

760
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,849
-Oh , my God ! Oh , my God !
-Sam !

761
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,312
Sam !

762
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,984
-Sam !
-Hold on !

763
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,402
-Pull me up !
-Hold on !

764
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,573
Sam , get back in !

765
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,411
I don't want to die !
We're gonna die ! Oh , my God !

766
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,605
Jesus ! Jesus !

767
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,406
Come here, boy.

768
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:09,992
Closer.

769
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,869
-Oh , my God .
-Okay.

770
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,372
You remember me, don't you?

771
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,916
I did what you said , okay?
J ust don't hurt us.

772
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,292
Shut up !

773
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,294
Sam !

774
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:30,513
Yeah ! Yes, yes.

775
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:34,141
It feels good to grab your flesh !

776
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:40,147
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

777
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:44,860
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

778
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,992
How I could snap your limbs off!

779
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,829
Doctor, examine this alien specimen .

780
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:58,791
I'll scan you .
Let's take a look at your face.

781
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:06,591
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information !

782
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,969
Yeah !

783
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,854
Beseeching my shard !

784
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,772
Easy or tough way?

785
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,505
-There they are.
-That's what I'm seeing in my head .

786
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:50,468
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

787
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:54,639
We must have the brain on the table !

788
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,308
-Chop, chop !
-Brain?

789
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,643
What does he mean by my brain?

790
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:01,646
Well , you have something on your mind ,
something I need .

791
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,689
Hold on . I know you're pissed .
I know you're pissed

792
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,691
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

793
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,193
If somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset, too.

794
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,862
I think that we have an opportunity here

795
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,074
to start anew
and develop our relationship

796
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,451
and see where it leads us, okay?

797
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,663
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds !

798
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,955
Wait, wait, wait!

799
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,964
-Come on ! Go, go !
-Sam !

800
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,927
Go, go, go !

801
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:00,287
Sam !

802
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,130
Run !

803
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,638
Go, go, go, go !

804
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,015
Here he comes !

805
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:28,232
H ide, Sam !

806
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,369
Weak!

807
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,624
Puny! Waste of metal !

808
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:51,005
J unkyard crap !

809
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,341
Decepticons !

810
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,896
Come here, boy.

811
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,806
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

812
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,974
The boy could lead us to it.

813
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,326
Optimus !

814
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:20,928
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

815
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,765
-U p ! Get up !
-You'll never stop at one !

816
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,394
I'll take you all on !

817
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,146
Piece of tin !

818
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,025
Sam ! Where are you?

819
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,778
No !

820
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,990
You're so weak!

821
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:54,605
The last Prime is dead !

822
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:08,202
Sam , run . Run .

823
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:20,214
Autobots, attack!

824
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,221
Bumblebee, get them out of here !

825
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,986
This is Lennox.

826
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,002
-That went well .
-We've lost the boy, Master.

827
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,587
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

828
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:04,925
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

829
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,304
-One insect among seven billion !
-Shut up !

830
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,058
He could be anywhere.

831
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:16,603
Then we will force them
to find him for us !

832
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:20,357
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

833
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,569
No more disguises. No mercy!

834
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:27,573
The time has come
for my master's arrival .

835
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:36,874
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.

836
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:56,727
<i>Speaking French is so exciting!</i>

837
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:58,520
Oh , God , who is this?

838
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:03,192
Hello? I mean , <i>bonsoir!</i>

839
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,863
-What? Who is this?
<i>-Where is the boy?</i>

840
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,868
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing .

841
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,118
Jeez!

842
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:56,787
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you .

843
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,080
Would you get out of here?

844
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,415
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

845
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,792
I want to try new things.

846
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,253
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

847
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,964
It's nasty.

848
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,581
Revenge is mine.

849
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,642
Yeah !

850
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:45,896
<i>...definitely not a plane...</i>

851
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,065
Look, carriers don't just sink.

852
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,276
<i>...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...</i>

853
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,570
Negative. NORAD confirmed ,

854
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:57,991
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30, 000 knots.

855
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:15,759
<i>Citizens of the human hive,</i>

856
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,263
<i>your leaders have withheld the truth.</i>

857
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,891
<i>You are not alone in this universe.</i>

858
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,687
<i>We have lived among you, hidden,</i>

859
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:30,357
<i>but no more.</i>

860
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:35,362
<i>As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,</i>

861
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,534
<i>unless you turn over this boy.</i>

862
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:51,878
<i>Ifyou resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.</i>

863
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,089
<i>What we're hearing
from the German government</i>

864
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:57,217
<i>is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.</i>

865
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:00,637
<i>The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,</i>

866
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,473
<i>which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.</i>

867
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,517
<i>President Obama
is being flown to a bunker</i>

868
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,269
<i>somewhere in the middle
of the United States</i>

869
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:11,815
<i>in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.</i>

870
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:17,279
<i>The aircraft carrier</i> USS Roosevelt <i>goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.</i>

871
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,532
<i>Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7, 000,</i>

872
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,326
<i>but that number could climb.</i>

873
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,452
It's still too early to tell .

874
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,954
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

875
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,957
<i>The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.</i>

876
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:31,752
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

877
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,171
The FBI , CIA and Interpol

878
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:37,591
<i>are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.</i>

879
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,801
You need to listen to this, man .
You gotta check this out.

880
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,512
<i>-They have a traffic-camera spotting. . .</i>
-They have a picture of me, man .

881
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:46,016
We're dead , bro.
FBI , CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

882
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,309
I just need you to focus

883
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,352
-for one minute, man .
-J ust stop.

884
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,020
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level , all right?

885
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,772
You know what? Give me this thing .
They can track us.

886
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,815
-Do you see this?
-What?

887
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,570
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

888
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,614
Okay, I'm not even with you guys !

889
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,033
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping ...

890
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,409
-Enough is. . .
-Yo, Leo !

891
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,870
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

892
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,331
-That's 'cause you is a wuss.
-You guys forced me into that car, right?

893
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,374
I think he's scared .

894
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:13,001
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

895
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,419
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

896
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,046
and then nobody gonna know nothing ,
know what I mean?

897
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,049
-Not in my trunk.
-Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you .

898
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,343
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you !

899
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,595
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

900
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,222
I've had a hell of a day!

901
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,725
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

902
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:29,935
Go whine to your boyfriend !

903
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,229
Listen , Sam , I know what I'm gonna do,
man . Look, I'm just going to go

904
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,355
to the authorities and tell them the truth .

905
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,439
Like, I had nothing to do with this.

906
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:36,066
-So, I'm not an accomplice.
-Hey, you wanted this, right?

907
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,484
You wanted the real deal?
Well , that's what this is.

908
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,902
Wake up ! You're in the middle of it!

909
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,321
You want to run? Go ahead !
No one's stopping you .

910
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,949
Stop complaining .

911
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,695
What is the meaning of this?

912
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,947
You dare point a gun at me?

913
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,784
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

914
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,164
Drop your weapons ! Drop your weapons !

915
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,707
-Tell them to lower their weapons !
-Tell them first.

916
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,833
Tell them to lower their weapons.

917
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,918
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him .

918
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,879
Your N EST team is deactivated , Major.

919
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:41,882
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

920
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,301
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

921
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,761
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

922
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,638
Well , I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

923
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:51,224
and I will raise you
a President of the U nited States.

924
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:52,767
I have operational command now.

925
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:55,061
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

926
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,771
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

927
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:58,899
The secret is out!

928
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:02,444
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

929
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,446
with a coordinated military strategy.

930
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,491
This fool is terribly misinformed .

931
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:08,950
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

932
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,744
What we need is to draw up battle plans

933
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,996
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution .

934
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,581
Like what, handing over the kid?

935
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,751
All options are being considered .

936
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,297
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

937
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,467
-There is no negotiating with them .
-I'm ordering you to stand down .

938
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,638
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base !

939
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,933
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

940
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,477
Let's go !

941
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:40,649
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

942
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,235
<i>Autobots, report to hangar for transport.</i>

943
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:48,657
-Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
-That's not what Optimus would want.

944
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,844
There's nothing
that you could have done.

945
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,560
-You okay?
-Yeah .

946
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,566
Bee, if you hate me, I understand .

947
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,535
I messed up. I'm sorry.

948
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,457
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.

949
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,627
If there's anything you need ,
I won't be far away.

950
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,592
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead .

951
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,761
There's some things
you just can't change.

952
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:56,016
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain . Hallelujah !

953
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,603
I'm gonna make it right.
I'm going to turn myself in .

954
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,855
We. . . We've got to stick together.

955
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,196
-You're not going to do that.
-Yes, I am .

956
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:18,038
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

957
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,834
-You two. . .
-H uh?

958
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,044
Hey, you know the glyphs?

959
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,588
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

960
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,384
That's old school , yo.
That's, like. . . That's Cybertronian .

961
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,011
That's some serious stuff, right there.

962
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,139
They gotta mean something ,
like a message or like a map.

963
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,641
Like a map to an Energon source !

964
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,977
-Can you read this?
-Read?

965
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,355
No. We don't really do much reading .
Not so much .

966
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,482
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can .

967
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,192
Look who came sashaying back!

968
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,860
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him .

969
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,779
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

970
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:51,988
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

971
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:53,948
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through .

972
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,659
I heard you have a problem .

973
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,745
-I think I know someone who can help.
-Who?

974
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,996
Robo-Warrior.

975
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,793
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

976
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,253
everything about anything alien ,
he's supposed to know.

977
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,713
One time we revenge-hacked his site

978
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:13,218
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

979
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,607
This is it. Yep.

980
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:28,858
Deli . Good front!

981
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,778
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?

982
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,948
N umber 42, we got your kishka, knish ,

983
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,159
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

984
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,577
Cash only. Who's next?

985
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:42,956
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

986
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,624
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

987
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,209
You . . . You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish , you retard !

988
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,627
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form .

989
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:48,920
Give me your money. Get out of here !

990
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,924
Hey, Sal ! Watch your reach , huh?
Take a number, young man .

991
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:54,926
Robo-Warrior.

992
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,805
-Know him?
-I never heard of him .

993
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,224
You never heard of
TheReal Effing Deal .com?

994
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,852
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

995
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,063
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

996
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,025
It's him ! It's him !
That's the guy right there ! That's him !

997
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,528
No.

998
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,406
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed !

999
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,867
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-When he says to go,

1000
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,535
-you go.
-That means you , lady, right now.

1001
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,746
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

1002
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:26,291
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven ,

1003
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,709
got the kibosh , disbanded .

1004
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,045
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing .

1005
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,090
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend .

1006
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:38,470
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron ! Where's the whitefish?

1007
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,430
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig .

1008
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,098
-Yakov!
-What?

1009
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:44,225
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around !

1010
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:46,102
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1011
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,396
-It's my dream .
-Help her out.

1012
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,064
You live with your mama?

1013
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,483
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1014
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:53,443
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1015
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,904
-Yeah , I know.
-And N BE One's still kicking , huh?

1016
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,156
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1017
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,617
I don't know what you're hiding ,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1018
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,453
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish .

1019
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,997
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on , I need your help.

1020
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,666
Really? You need my help?

1021
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,377
I need . . .
Look, I am slowly losing my mind .

1022
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,087
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1023
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:15,298
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1024
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,218
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie !

1025
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,054
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1026
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,306
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1027
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,975
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1028
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:27,977
Dead pigs.

1029
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:30,230
What you're about to see is top secret.

1030
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,024
Do not tell my mother.

1031
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,152
-Swine flu . Not good .
-Now you know.

1032
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:39,197
Next time you eat a goat or a pig ,
there's a story behind it.

1033
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,573
Sad little story.

1034
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:41,825
<i>An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</i>

1035
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:42,992
<i>Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</i>

1036
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:46,246
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1037
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:49,541
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1038
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,252
Okay, Cube-brain .

1039
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,088
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1040
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,506
Where'd you get these?

1041
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,260
Before I got fired ,
I poached S-7's crown jewel ,

1042
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:05,723
over 75 years of alien research ,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1043
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:09,769
The Transformers,
they've been here a long , long time.

1044
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,271
How do I know?

1045
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,274
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1046
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,609
in ancient ruins all over the world .

1047
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,112
China. Egypt. Greece.

1048
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,656
Shot in 1 932.

1049
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,575
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1050
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,244
-Yeah .
-Same ones over here, right?

1051
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,124
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1052
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,128
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed .

1053
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,131
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1054
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,094
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along .

1055
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,472
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1056
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:50,059
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1057
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:53,688
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal ,

1058
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,232
that I was obsessed .

1059
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,067
Me. Can you imagine that?

1060
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:01,279
Yeah . Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1061
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,239
-On Earth . Another source?
-On Earth .

1062
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:06,200
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head , would lead him there.

1063
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:08,036
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1064
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,412
No, no, no, the source is before them .

1065
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,331
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them .

1066
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,498
It's before them .

1067
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:14,584
-So, it comes before them .
-Correct.

1068
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,046
Well , then we're porked ,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon .

1069
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,214
I mean ,
I'm not on speaking terms with them .

1070
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:22,008
Actually, I am .

1071
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,056
Let me out!

1072
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,391
-This is going to be a little bit sad .
-Open it.

1073
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:34,228
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1074
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,772
Hey, behave !

1075
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,690
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah .

1076
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,567
-And you're training him?
-I'm trying to.

1077
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,154
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1078
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,574
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1079
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,619
Do you want a throwdown ,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1080
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,872
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1081
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,084
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1082
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,585
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1083
01:19:57,669 --> 01:20:01,047
J ust tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1084
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,257
All right.

1085
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,595
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1086
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:11,182
I don't read it, but these guys...

1087
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,768
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1088
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,647
-Is this they?
-Yeah . Seekers, pal . Oldest of the old .

1089
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:21,317
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something . I don't know what.

1090
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:24,904
Nobody tells me nothing , but they'll
translate those symbols for you .

1091
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,323
-And I know where to find them .
-Show us.

1092
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:28,741
Yeah .

1093
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:34,414
The closest one's in Washington .

1094
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:41,754
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum .
Land of dreams in there.

1095
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,507
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1096
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,553
-Hold those.
-What is that?

1097
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:51,556
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1098
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,144
So does Giambi , Jeter.
It's a baseball thing . Okay.

1099
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,729
Watches synchronized ,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1100
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:01,691
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1101
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,526
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1102
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,903
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1103
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,697
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1104
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,532
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road .

1105
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,076
No, listen , I can't do this.

1106
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,078
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

1107
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:16,706
-Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
-Kid , kid , kid .

1108
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,709
You compromise this mission ,
you are dead to me.

1109
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,378
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1110
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,714
<i>The museum is now closing.</i>

1111
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,717
Yo, baba ! Bad news, bro !
Ran out of toilet paper!

1112
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,093
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1113
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:32,180
Sir! I suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed !

1114
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,682
Listen , man , I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1115
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:36,684
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.

1116
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,687
Sir, you are a grown ,
naked man around children .

1117
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:42,690
-Pull your pants up and exit the building .
-I'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,073
-You got that paper, right, sir?
-You should be embarrassed .

1119
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:52,283
This is a family museum , sir.

1120
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,761
What is going on here?

1121
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,349
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1122
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,643
You are an amateur, man ,
a rank amateur.

1123
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:24,732
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1124
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:26,484
-Get your stuff and get out of here.
-Give me a second here.

1125
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,277
I got to get the tracker, all right.

1126
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,780
-Be good .
-I'm claustrophobic.

1127
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,008
Look, look. Follow him . Follow him .
He knows where he's going .

1128
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,890
-He knows something .
-What?

1129
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,016
He knows something .

1130
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:05,982
You got what I got?

1131
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,733
-Yeah .
-Blackbird .

1132
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,321
There he is.

1133
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:16,033
This guy's a legend ,
like the Chairman of the Board !

1134
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:20,329
Yo, freshman , point the shard
and watch the magic happen .

1135
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,463
Shit. It's a Decepticon !

1136
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,924
-Decepticon?
-Decepticon?

1137
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,051
Behind the MiG now!

1138
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,358
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1139
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:52,695
Answer me, pawns and knaves !

1140
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,115
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath !

1141
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:00,286
You little spinal-cord-based organisms !

1142
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,663
Bugger it!

1143
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:07,668
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire !

1144
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,129
Prepare for remote systems override !

1145
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:12,757
-I tell you , this guy did not age well .
-I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1146
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,134
I command these doors to open .

1147
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:19,180
Fire ! I said , fire !

1148
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,390
Bollocks !

1149
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:25,061
-Damn these worthless parts.
-Wait a second !

1150
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:28,481
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse !

1151
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,735
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1152
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,487
We gotta catch that plane.

1153
01:24:37,365 --> 01:24:41,827
-Right. I'm on a mission .
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1154
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:43,746
-What do you want?
-Look, we just want to talk!

1155
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,581
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission .

1156
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,918
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?

1157
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,378
-Earth .
-Earth?

1158
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:55,508
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1159
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,011
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1160
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:00,763
-Who's winning?
-The Decepticons.

1161
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,226
-Well , I changed sides to the Autobots.
-What do you mean , "changed sides"?

1162
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,813
It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision .

1163
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,566
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1164
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:13,651
You mean you don't have to work

1165
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,444
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1166
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:19,073
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1167
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,951
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1168
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,203
-Who's your little Autobot?
-You're cute.

1169
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:27,331
Name's Wheelie. Yeah .
Say my name, say my name.

1170
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:29,625
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1171
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:30,835
At least he's faithful , Sam .

1172
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,879
Yeah , well , he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted .

1173
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,465
Can you just. . . Can you stop?

1174
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:37,967
-Hey, what are you doing?
-It's just something

1175
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,969
to think about. I won't argue with . . .
What were you saying?

1176
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:44,140
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1177
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,641
Somebody shit the bed this morning .

1178
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:47,310
-Look at this guy.
-I have issues of my own .

1179
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:48,894
And it started with my mother!

1180
01:25:48,978 --> 01:25:51,439
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1181
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:54,483
My father, he was a wheel ,
the first wheel .

1182
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,819
-Do you know what he transformed into?
-No.

1183
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,945
Nothing !

1184
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:01,699
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1185
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:09,540
Bollocks.

1186
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,084
My boosters are fried .

1187
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,296
I think we can help each other.

1188
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,257
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.

1189
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,760
I don't think he knows anything .
Honestly, I don't.

1190
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,847
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1191
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,892
They're symbols, but they're in my mind .
You see, all this is in my mind

1192
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,852
and Megatron wants what's in my mind .

1193
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,147
-H im and someone called The Fallen .
-The Fallen? I know him .

1194
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,484
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon .

1195
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:40,363
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1196
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:42,490
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission ,

1197
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:43,532
The Fallen's search .

1198
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:47,203
I remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1199
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,372
Slow down . The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1200
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:53,959
No time to explain . Hold on , everybody!
Stay still or you'll die !

1201
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,904
Well , that wasn't so bad .

1202
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,656
I just hope we're still on the right planet.

1203
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,699
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1204
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,327
Oh , my God .

1205
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,836
Oh , God .

1206
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,259
Oh , my God , what a beautiful face.

1207
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:47,304
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1208
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:49,014
Please, get off.

1209
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,393
God , my balls.

1210
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,854
Sam !

1211
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:59,066
-Where are we? Simmons !
-Hey! Yeah !

1212
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:04,113
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
What is this? It's Vegas.

1213
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,031
-You guys okay?
-Yeah .

1214
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:08,617
Hey, I think we're in Vegas !

1215
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:12,288
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1216
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:15,040
People could have gotten killed , okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1217
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:17,084
-you would have heard . . .
-Shut up.

1218
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:21,464
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1219
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:24,383
When did you . . . When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything .

1220
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,218
You didn't tell us anything .
Why are we in Egypt?

1221
01:28:26,302 --> 01:28:30,890
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling !
You were duly informed !

1222
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,641
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1223
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:33,893
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1224
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,645
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1225
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:40,149
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1226
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,985
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1227
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,988
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon ,

1228
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,657
the lifeblood of our race.

1229
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:53,579
Without it, we'll all perish , oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1230
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,583
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1231
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,586
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1232
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:06,592
Beginning , middle, end .
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1233
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:11,514
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1234
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:15,809
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1235
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:17,603
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

1236
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,563
Yes. You see, in the beginning ,

1237
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:22,775
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1238
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,946
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1239
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:33,035
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1240
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,038
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1241
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,376
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen .

1242
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,505
He despised the human race

1243
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,885
<i>and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.</i>

1244
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:54,014
<i>The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</i>

1245
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:57,184
<i>called the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

1246
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,861
<i>A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</i>

1247
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:15,160
<i>The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</i>

1248
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:21,000
<i>so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</i>

1249
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,463
<i>In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</i>

1250
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:29,717
<i>in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</i>

1251
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,345
<i>a tomb we cannot find.</i>

1252
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,477
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1253
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,605
The Fallen knows where it is

1254
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:48,319
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1255
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,321
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1256
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,781
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen .

1257
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,450
Optimus Prime?

1258
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:58,996
So, you've met a Prime?

1259
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,166
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1260
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,377
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1261
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,380
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1262
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,299
So, he's dead .

1263
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,470
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen .

1264
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,557
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1265
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:21,268
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1266
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:22,394
and bring him back to life?

1267
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:27,191
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1268
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:31,153
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1269
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,448
Follow your mind , your map,
your symbols.

1270
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,159
What you carved in the sand ,
it's your clue.

1271
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,456
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1272
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,500
Find the doorway!

1273
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,460
Go now! Go !

1274
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,463
That was my mission .
It's your mission now.

1275
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:53,842
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you .

1276
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:01,684
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1277
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:05,312
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1278
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:07,272
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-It's part of the Red Sea.

1279
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,525
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1280
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,445
29. 5 degrees north , 35 east. Here it is.

1281
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:15,906
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1282
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,450
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1283
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:19,702
I'm gonna make a call .

1284
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:23,914
We got cops !

1285
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:31,296
I can't go to prison , guys.

1286
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,803
Sam , we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1287
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,232
Man , stupid cops !

1288
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,526
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1289
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:56,405
-Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
-They're gone.

1290
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,116
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...

1291
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,534
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1292
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,245
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1293
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,956
-CIA is all over this place !
-You're gonna call .

1294
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,089
-Okay. That's a good idea.
-All right.

1295
01:33:14,173 --> 01:33:16,592
I mean , I just had my mind
on other things,

1296
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,135
like winding up in an Egyptian prison .

1297
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:23,182
<i>NEST departure, 2100 hours.</i>

1298
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:28,312
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1299
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,903
Major Lennox, phone call .

1300
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,782
Lennox, I'm with the kid . The kid . You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1301
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,450
We need the truck. The truck.

1302
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,286
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1303
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:48,624
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen .

1304
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,250
Back of a $ 1 bill .

1305
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:57,007
Coordinates for airdrop, 29. 5 north ,
34. 88 east. Write it down . Write it.

1306
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,802
Oh , my God . I got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1307
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,428
Wait, who are you?

1308
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,140
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1309
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:06,308
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go !

1310
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,185
Move, move, move, move.

1311
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:13,065
Coordinates, 29. 5 north , 34. 88 east.

1312
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,609
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba.

1313
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,237
Egypt? Are you serious?

1314
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,948
Sir.

1315
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:28,080
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1316
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,833
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1317
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:34,253
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him .

1318
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:37,923
Okay, let's go over it again .

1319
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,175
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1320
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:42,553
-the Three Kings. . .
-Will reveal the doorway.

1321
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:44,429
That's what he said .
You know what it means?

1322
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:46,056
-No, what does it mean?
-I have no idea.

1323
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,933
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1324
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,434
I don't have my passport.

1325
01:34:51,812 --> 01:34:53,188
Passport!

1326
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:02,114
They got cameras at the top.

1327
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,538
All right, chill . This is espionage time.
I can handle it.

1328
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:12,666
These are my people.
I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1329
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:17,087
Great, a fricking Munchkin .

1330
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,631
Little people are mean .
Tell him he's tall .

1331
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,310
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1332
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,896
Egypt, Jordan . We want to go there.

1333
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:37,232
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son ,

1334
01:35:37,316 --> 01:35:40,944
my other son , my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1335
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:42,905
-New York?
-Yes. Yes.

1336
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:44,031
Fifty kilometers.

1337
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:46,450
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand . Thank you very much .

1338
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:48,702
-I know. I know you from somewhere.
-Go, Yankees !

1339
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:50,537
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1340
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:59,671
Decepticons, boy's location detected .

1341
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,600
U ndercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1342
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,019
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1343
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:25,197
Awesome ! I think aliens built that.

1344
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:26,573
Yeah , yeah .

1345
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:29,368
Come on . Move it! Move it!

1346
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,578
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1347
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:34,748
Yeah , some of us got work to do !
Dumb Autobots.

1348
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:59,439
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health .

1349
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:04,403
Yeah , well , girls like dangerous boys.

1350
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,405
-Do they?
-Yeah .

1351
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:11,410
You might as well just say it.

1352
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,953
Ladies first.

1353
01:37:14,413 --> 01:37:17,124
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman .

1354
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,335
-You're really chivalrous.
-Why are you mad at me?

1355
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:23,922
You know what?
Baby, I'm not. . . I'm not mad .

1356
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:29,511
Do you realize that I just flew 3, 000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1357
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,804
I know.

1358
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,810
Who else could be your girlfriend , Sam?

1359
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,604
Look at the things I go through with you .

1360
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,399
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1361
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:44,693
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1362
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:47,112
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1363
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:49,573
Pyramids.

1364
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,200
What? Why do boys always

1365
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:54,244
-change the subject?
-Pyramids and stars.

1366
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,787
-Sam?
-Come with me really quick.

1367
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,048
Simmons ! Leo ! Wake up !

1368
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,636
Listen , astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1369
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,389
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1370
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:16,641
-Here. Get up. U p, up.
-What is he talking about?

1371
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:23,065
Okay, you see those three stars?

1372
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:24,900
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1373
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,736
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1374
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,613
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1375
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,491
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1376
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:34,409
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1377
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:37,954
They all point due east, towards Jordan .
The mountains of Petra.

1378
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,260
<i>We've had an engine malfunction.</i>

1379
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,304
<i>We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.</i>

1380
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,473
<i>Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.</i>

1381
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:59,017
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1382
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:02,020
-All right, team , grab your chutes !
-Bailout like bailout?

1383
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:07,067
-You familiar with the standard MC-4?
-Of course not!

1384
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,444
I've never jumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before !

1385
01:39:09,528 --> 01:39:10,904
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1386
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,781
-Yeah .
-All right, here we go.

1387
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:17,452
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1388
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:19,162
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1389
01:39:19,246 --> 01:39:23,125
These guys don't mess around .
This is just standard procedure.

1390
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:26,378
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1391
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:30,090
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1392
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:36,304
What was that? What was that?

1393
01:39:36,388 --> 01:39:38,723
That's not good . Come on .

1394
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,226
-Right this way!
-I can't jump out of an airplane !

1395
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,353
-I have an ulcer! No, no.
-Come on . It's okay.

1396
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,981
I really can't do this.
What are you doing ...

1397
01:39:46,523 --> 01:39:48,567
Come here ! Come here.

1398
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:52,904
-Why aren't you wearing your chute?
-Because I have to secure the VI Ps first.

1399
01:39:52,988 --> 01:39:57,200
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.

1400
01:39:57,284 --> 01:40:00,245
Each chute has a G PS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1401
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:02,455
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1402
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:04,666
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed .

1403
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,835
-Okay, are you listening?
-I can't hear what...

1404
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,336
-Stop that!
-All right. All right.

1405
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,881
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1406
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:13,133
it pulls the pin and opens the main .

1407
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,260
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

1408
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:19,514
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard !

1409
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:22,434
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass !

1410
01:40:25,312 --> 01:40:28,315
-He say good-bye?
-No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1411
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,567
<i>General, we're loaded and ready.</i>

1412
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,528
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1413
01:40:33,612 --> 01:40:36,156
-Excellent.
-Sir, you need to see this now.

1414
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,161
-Have we checked these coordinates?
-Egypt, sir.

1415
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:44,039
-They're airdropping in .
-You've got to be kidding me.

1416
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,498
He knows something .

1417
01:40:45,582 --> 01:40:47,959
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1418
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,378
Copy that.

1419
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:52,923
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1420
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:55,550
1 00 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1421
01:40:55,634 --> 01:40:56,718
It's getting hotter.

1422
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:03,808
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1423
01:41:25,038 --> 01:41:27,040
You see the size of this?

1424
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,168
-You see this?
-Spectacular.

1425
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,297
Amazing . Look at that.

1426
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,851
-It's here somewhere, guys.
-Yeah , why?

1427
01:41:46,935 --> 01:41:48,478
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1428
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,063
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1429
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:54,150
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.

1430
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:58,446
Okay. Well , that's great.
Let me do a quick search , all right?

1431
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,115
Nope. Ever cross your mind , guys,

1432
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:01,616
that archeologists
have been here before?

1433
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,784
There's nothing here.

1434
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,245
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid .

1435
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,455
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1436
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:09,708
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1437
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,168
I'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1438
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,463
-It's not over.
-It is over. It's done.

1439
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:17,048
Why are we still listening to you ,
little punk-ass?

1440
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,175
I mean , what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1441
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:21,219
Killed Megatron . How about that?

1442
01:42:21,303 --> 01:42:22,345
Well , he didn't get the job done,

1443
01:42:22,429 --> 01:42:23,972
you know what I mean ,
'cause he's back now...

1444
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:26,975
-Are you scared?
-Scared? Scared of your ugly face !

1445
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,477
I'm ugly?
Well , we're twins, you stupid genius !

1446
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,313
Bring it, then ! Get off me !

1447
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:34,482
-I'll change your face around !
-I'll get all up in that ass !

1448
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:35,984
Bring it!

1449
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:37,902
Guys !

1450
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:40,822
-You like the way that feels?
-That didn't hurt.

1451
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,449
You like that, don't you?

1452
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:44,909
-Come on , Bumblebee !
-Bumblebee, listen .

1453
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:52,584
Now, that's rude.

1454
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,514
Oh , my God . The symbols.

1455
01:43:07,766 --> 01:43:09,601
Bee ! Shoot it.

1456
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,129
-Check this out.
-Look at it.

1457
01:43:39,381 --> 01:43:40,382
Wow!

1458
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:42,967
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1459
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:45,428
The tomb of the Primes.

1460
01:43:45,887 --> 01:43:47,138
Yo !

1461
01:43:48,473 --> 01:43:49,641
Yo !

1462
01:44:03,655 --> 01:44:04,989
The Matrix.

1463
01:44:22,549 --> 01:44:23,758
No.

1464
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,136
No.

1465
01:44:28,513 --> 01:44:31,057
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1466
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:33,643
This isn't how it's supposed to end .

1467
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:34,894
Hear that?

1468
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:41,818
US Air Force ! C-1 7s !

1469
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,612
-What's a C-1 7?
-You can't bring him back, Sam .

1470
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:48,283
-There's nothing left.
-Look! Look around you .

1471
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,952
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all ,

1472
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,454
to just have it end like this.

1473
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:54,205
There is a reason that we are here.

1474
01:44:54,289 --> 01:44:58,168
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1475
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,342
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,

1476
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,848
and what I know is that
this is going to work.

1477
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:15,351
-How do you know it's gonna work?
-Because I believe it.

1478
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,739
You best let me out of this plane.

1479
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,377
Dropping the big boy. Sam !

1480
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:50,762
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1481
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:52,430
Absolutely. Let's go.

1482
01:46:02,524 --> 01:46:03,733
Go !

1483
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,278
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1484
01:46:17,914 --> 01:46:19,457
Cover Optimus !

1485
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,504
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1486
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:26,714
I need snipers and Stingers up high .

1487
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:30,927
So, we just dropped off 1 0 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1488
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,637
I hope this little kid know
what he's doing .

1489
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,763
Yeah , me too.

1490
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,939
Got a visual ! Yellow team ! Four clicks !

1491
01:46:46,234 --> 01:46:47,569
Pop flare !

1492
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:52,448
-That's them , right there. See the flare?
-Right over there ! See it?

1493
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:04,669
Sam !

1494
01:47:17,015 --> 01:47:18,558
Oh , God . Please, God ! Please.

1495
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,268
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1496
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:21,769
Shut this guy up, huh?

1497
01:47:21,853 --> 01:47:24,272
-Please, just let me live, just let me live !
-Shut up and let him drive !

1498
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:25,648
-J ust stop screaming . . .
-All right, that's it!

1499
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:29,819
I can't take that guy anymore.

1500
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,168
H ide in the dust! Use the dust!

1501
01:47:52,759 --> 01:47:54,719
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1502
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,472
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? I'm gonna get Optimus.

1503
01:47:57,555 --> 01:48:00,099
I'll help draw their fire
with H uey and Dewey there.

1504
01:48:00,183 --> 01:48:02,226
You get to those soldiers.

1505
01:48:03,353 --> 01:48:06,397
-I hope that dust works, kid .
-Thank you .

1506
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:13,655
He's turning around . He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1507
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,448
It's up to me.

1508
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:18,409
One man , alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1509
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:20,995
now its last hope
in their final hour of need .

1510
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:24,749
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1511
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,835
-Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere ! Drive.
-You'll never make it, kid .

1512
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:30,380
-I'm coming with you .
-Bravery will only get you so far.

1513
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:33,383
You tased me, okay? You owe me !
I'm going .

1514
01:48:33,466 --> 01:48:35,259
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed . All right?

1515
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:46,979
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1516
01:48:51,067 --> 01:48:53,236
-What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy?

1517
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,363
-Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy?

1518
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:57,740
-Radio's down .
-It's dead . Comms are down .

1519
01:48:57,824 --> 01:48:59,158
EMP burst.

1520
01:48:59,534 --> 01:49:02,412
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1521
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:05,206
Yes, sir?

1522
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:08,126
<i>-Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.</i>
-I know, sir.

1523
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:11,045
Well , what country am I in right now?

1524
01:49:11,129 --> 01:49:12,380
U nited States.

1525
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:16,384
No, not the U nited States.
I'm from the U nited States.

1526
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:19,137
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.</i>

1527
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:24,058
Well , that was our good friend ,
Galloway. He's less than pleased .

1528
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:26,811
How is it that we can't reach our men ,

1529
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:32,275
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1530
01:49:36,279 --> 01:49:37,530
Nothing .

1531
01:49:38,114 --> 01:49:40,992
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1532
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:43,077
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, boys, old school time !

1533
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,997
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1534
01:49:51,586 --> 01:49:55,047
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1535
01:49:55,715 --> 01:50:00,553
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1536
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:06,017
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1537
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,770
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1538
01:50:08,853 --> 01:50:11,230
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind . We're working it, sir.

1539
01:50:11,314 --> 01:50:14,942
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.

1540
01:50:15,026 --> 01:50:18,446
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1541
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,907
and get Egypt's General Salam .

1542
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,869
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1543
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:28,039
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1544
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:29,874
Scramble Predators now.

1545
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:31,459
V-1 , rotate.

1546
01:50:43,513 --> 01:50:45,348
We still have a mile that way.

1547
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,396
Come on .

1548
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,068
This way. This way.

1549
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:05,034
-One man , alone. . .
-Stop saying that!

1550
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,369
... betrayed by the country he loves !

1551
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:08,663
Oh , my goodness.
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1552
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:11,833
J ust relax. You're with the maestro.

1553
01:51:20,508 --> 01:51:22,552
I don't think he's still following us.

1554
01:51:23,553 --> 01:51:25,221
That's what you think.

1555
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:45,825
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1556
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:48,953
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1557
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:51,247
The boy must have the Matrix.

1558
01:51:51,664 --> 01:51:54,292
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1559
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:58,629
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1560
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:00,965
We've got incoming !

1561
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:20,026
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

1562
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:22,111
-How many?
-About 1 3 of them .

1563
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,864
This ain't good . This ain't good .

1564
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,291
We're about to get our asses whupped .

1565
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,210
Bravo-Charlie, kneel !

1566
01:52:38,294 --> 01:52:41,172
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam .

1567
01:52:42,548 --> 01:52:45,468
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1568
01:52:45,551 --> 01:52:48,429
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1569
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:51,307
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team .

1570
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,433
I'm leading .

1571
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,936
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide !

1572
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,562
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1573
01:52:56,646 --> 01:52:59,398
I want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1574
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:02,693
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1575
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:17,083
You ever see that film
<i>Gunfight at the O. K. Corral?</i>

1576
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:21,754
-With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
-No, why?

1577
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:27,843
-Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
-Is that good?

1578
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:31,597
A lot of people died .

1579
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:51,742
H ide !

1580
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,246
<i>-Vámonos, amigos!</i>
-Oh , my God !

1581
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,168
-H it the deck!
-Oh , my God !

1582
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:18,269
Sam , Sam .

1583
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,397
I don't think they saw us.

1584
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,774
Get down . Get down . Get down .

1585
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:25,735
Okay. Listen .

1586
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:30,948
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can , okay?

1587
01:54:32,283 --> 01:54:33,784
What if it doesn't work?

1588
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,203
It's gonna work.

1589
01:54:36,287 --> 01:54:39,290
-What if it doesn't?
-It's gonna work. It'll work.

1590
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,179
U p, up, up !

1591
01:56:27,148 --> 01:56:28,816
Get ready to jump !

1592
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:50,337
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1593
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:54,383
Fall back!

1594
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:57,928
-Ironhide, up the middle !
-Ironhide, move it!

1595
01:56:58,012 --> 01:57:00,014
Let's go ! Go, go !

1596
01:57:07,188 --> 01:57:08,564
Devastator!

1597
01:57:12,026 --> 01:57:13,944
We're trapped ! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1598
01:57:14,111 --> 01:57:16,739
If we're going out, we're going out
like men , understand?

1599
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:50,731
Look at this mother...

1600
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,483
Mean robots suck!

1601
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,039
Hang on ! Hang on , okay?

1602
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:13,462
-Simmons !
-Don't let go !

1603
01:58:13,545 --> 01:58:16,006
Hang in there, I got you ! J ust hang in .

1604
01:58:20,135 --> 01:58:21,637
I don't want to die !

1605
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:25,182
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip !

1606
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:26,517
You ain't getting me !

1607
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,857
He dead . He got so ate.

1608
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:37,111
-Who's your daddy now, huh?
-He got all ate up.

1609
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,321
The only safe place is right under it.

1610
01:58:39,405 --> 01:58:43,075
-Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
-Yeah .

1611
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:53,294
You should've never eaten me !
I'm gonna bust your face up !

1612
01:58:58,299 --> 01:58:59,466
Oh , my God !

1613
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:04,722
Nobody mess with me ! In your face !

1614
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:07,308
Keep fighting , Mudflap !

1615
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:08,475
Oh , my God !

1616
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:18,193
Nobody messes with the twins.

1617
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:24,241
I got you . . . My bad !

1618
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:29,079
Man ! You shot me in the face !

1619
01:59:29,496 --> 01:59:31,790
-Stay under it!
-Yeah , stay under it!

1620
01:59:35,753 --> 01:59:37,087
Come on .

1621
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,480
J udy!

1622
01:59:59,568 --> 02:00:01,653
-Sam ! Sam !
-What?

1623
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,615
Sam ! Sam !

1624
02:00:09,078 --> 02:00:10,329
Sam !

1625
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:11,747
-Sam !
-Dad !

1626
02:00:19,463 --> 02:00:20,881
Wait, wait!

1627

Please listen to me !
I want you to run ! Run !

1628
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:28,430
Dad , just stop !
They don't want you , they want me !

1629
02:00:28,514 --> 02:00:29,973
-Oh , God !
-Wait!

1630
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:31,934
Sam Witwicky.

1631
02:00:32,017 --> 02:00:36,313
Don't hurt them . This is what you want.
You don't want them .

1632
02:00:36,397 --> 02:00:38,065
-Go ! Go !
-Please, stop !

1633
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:39,316
-Stop !
-Listen to your father!

1634
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,193
J ust get out of here !

1635
02:00:41,527 --> 02:00:43,904
J ust don't hurt them .
I know what you want.

1636
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:45,489
J ust go ! J ust go !

1637
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:49,368
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.

1638
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:51,537
-Don't do it, Sam . . .
-Please, Dad .

1639
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:55,582
-They're going to kill us all anyway!
-Here's what you want, right here.

1640
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:57,376
Bumblebee !

1641
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,224
Kill him , Bee. Kill him .

1642
02:01:50,179 --> 02:01:52,723
-Stay tight, Ma.
-Come on . Get in here.

1643
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,405
-Bee?
-Yeah .

1644
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,035
-Hey!
-I don't know

Against the wall ! Against the wall !
Against the wall . Against the wall .

1649
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:32,095
Bee ! Bumblebee !

1650
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:34,932
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1651
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:38,435
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1652
02:02:38,519 --> 02:02:40,354
No, this isn't up for discussion !

1653
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:42,356
-You're my son ! You're my son !

Dad , stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

You know, you run .
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run .

1658
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:53,450
You hear what I'm saying , okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1659
02:02:53,534 --> 02:02:55,035
-No.
-You've got to let me go, Dad .

1660

1665
02:03:23,772 --> 02:03:25,315
Move to cover!

1666
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:31,321
We got Jordanians !

We got help !

1668

You okay, soldier?

1670

We're gonna help you , soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird .

1671
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:03,687
Stay still . Stay still . Don't move.

1672
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:06,064
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1673
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:11,987
Hey, kid , it's been nice knowing you .
Remember what I did for my country.

1674
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,157
This is my moment.

1675
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:16,992
You're crazy!

1676
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:20,954
ETA to station , two minutes.

1677
02:04:21,038 --> 02:04:22,914
-Put it on the main screen .
-Sir. Yes, sir.

1678
02:04:22,998 --> 02:04:24,374
Predator 01 .

1679
02:04:34,885 --> 02:04:36,094
Shit, it's a trick.

1680
02:04:36,178 --> 02:04:38,597
Commence Operation Firestorm .

1681
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:41,266
-Get those Marines on the ground .
-Roll in strike packages...

-Spotted Sam !

Ironhide !

1685
02:05:08,919 --> 02:05:11,088
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1686
02:05:13,924 --> 02:05:16,593
Get out, Sam ! Get to the pillars !

1687
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:18,929
Let's go.

1688
02:05:22,641 --> 02:05:26,144
Oh , God . This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1689
02:05:26,228 --> 02:05:30,607
If they turn that machine on ,
no more sun .

1690
02:05:33,068 --> 02:05:34,444
Not on my watch .

1691
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,489
Not on my watch .

1692
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:50,001
<i>USS Stennis.</i> Identify.

1693
02:05:50,085 --> 02:05:52,504
<i>Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?</i>

1694
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,464
SportsCenter?
I Dream of Jeannie <i>or something?</i>

1695
02:05:54,548 --> 02:05:58,552
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1696
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,137
Identify yourself.

1697
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:01,888
What is your name, sailor?

1698
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:07,436
Wilder, Captain of the
<i>USS John C. Stennis</i> aircraft carrier.

1699
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:10,397
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1700
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,816
<i>This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.</i>

1701
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:15,277
<i>There is the mother
of all non-biologicals</i>

1702
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,154
<i>getting ready to blow up our sun.</i>

1703
02:06:17,237 --> 02:06:19,072
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1704
02:06:19,156 --> 02:06:21,158
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1705
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:24,494
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening .

1706
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:34,379
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1707
02:06:34,463 --> 02:06:37,424
<i>we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.</i>

1708
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,552
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun ,

1709
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:43,680
<i>-shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.</i>
-That's classified .

1710
02:06:43,764 --> 02:06:47,350
Don't talk to me about classified ,
all right?

1711
02:06:47,434 --> 02:06:50,103
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,

1712
02:06:50,187 --> 02:06:52,731
you tell them to ready that weapon !

1713
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:56,318
Contact destroyer <i>USS KIDD.</i>

1714
02:06:57,194 --> 02:06:58,862
Alpha Team , flank left!

1715

This way! Move it!

1716
02:07:02,657 --> 02:07:04,910
-Where do you need us, sir?
-Protect those in the line of fire.

1717
02:07:04,993 --> 02:07:06,620
Let's go ! Go !

1718
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:13,043
Give me your Comms. Come on . Epps !

1719
02:07:17,422 --> 02:07:19,800
Right now, we need air support, ASAP !

1720
02:07:19,883 --> 02:07:22,469
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1721
02:07:22,552 --> 02:07:23,678
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:29,351
B-1 , snap 090.

1723
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:31,853
You are approved to drop your
2, 000-pound J DAMs.

1724
02:07:39,069 --> 02:07:40,403
-What you got?
-I couldn't get to them , sir.

1725
02:07:40,487 --> 02:07:42,531
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1726
02:07:42,614 --> 02:07:45,492
All right. Precious cargo's coming !

1727
02:07:45,826 --> 02:07:46,827
Move !

1728
02:07:57,671 --> 02:07:59,214
Curse you !

1729
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:15,272
Sam ! Spotted Sam !

1730
02:08:47,554 --> 02:08:49,306
-Come on !
-2-2 covering fire.

1731
02:08:49,389 --> 02:08:50,807
Two civilians, 1 2 o'clock!

1732
02:08:59,357 --> 02:09:00,942
Cover for us !

1733
02:09:07,324 --> 02:09:10,118
Hold the air strike !
We're rescuing civilians !

1734
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:24,007
Keep firing !

1735
02:09:30,013 --> 02:09:31,681
Come on ! Mikaela !

1736
02:09:32,098 --> 02:09:34,434
Come on ! Get in here !

1737
02:09:35,352 --> 02:09:36,811
Look who showed up.

1738
02:09:36,895 --> 02:09:38,897
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1739
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,690
-Where's Optimus?
-He's right over there,

1740
02:09:40,774 --> 02:09:42,192
across the courtyard .

1741
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:45,236
-I got to get to him right now.
-Not with an air strike coming .

1742
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,530
I have to get to him right now.

1743
02:09:49,074 --> 02:09:50,408
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1744
02:09:50,492 --> 02:09:52,202
-Go.
-Listen up...

1745
02:09:55,664 --> 02:09:56,873

Behold the glory of Jetfire !

1749
02:10:10,178 --> 02:10:13,723
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1750
02:10:33,785 --> 02:10:35,078
I'm too old for this crap.

1751
02:10:35,245 --> 02:10:37,914
Keep going , man , 1 5 rounds of fighting .

1752
02:10:58,059 --> 02:11:01,563
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum .

1753
02:11:02,313 --> 02:11:05,608
<i>25. 7 meters above sea level,

We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command , okay?

1760
02:11:34,137 --> 02:11:37,057
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1761
02:11:37,265 --> 02:11:40,518
<i>- 1- 1 tally orange smoke.</i>
-I hope these F-1 6s got good aim .

1762
02:11:40,602 --> 02:11:44,147
-Yeah? Why is that?
-I told them to hit the orange smoke.

1763
02:11:45,732 --> 02:11:47,192
You mean that orange smoke?

1764
02:11:47,275 --> 02:11:48,860
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

1765
02:11:48,943 --> 02:11:51,696
<i>-Viper, thunder.</i>

Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?

You have fought for Optimus,

with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

a leader worthy of our secret.

The Matrix of Leadership is not found ,

It is, and always has been , your destiny.

1798
02:15:39,757 --> 02:15:40,883
Sam !

1799
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:49,809
I love you . I love you .

1800
02:16:27,263 --> 02:16:30,600
Boy, you returned for me.

1801
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:33,895
A living Prime.

1802
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:37,690
I don't believe it!

1803
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:50,161
My Matrix!

1804
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,418
Get up ! Get up ! Get up ! Get up !

1805
02:16:58,294 --> 02:16:59,837
Get up, Prime !

1806
02:17:01,756 --> 02:17:03,132
Oh , no.

1807
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:07,470
He's turning on the machine !
You got to stop him ! Get up !

1808
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:09,305
Optimus !

1809
02:17:11,516 --> 02:17:13,893
Fallen , my master.

1810
02:17:13,976 --> 02:17:18,439
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1811
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:23,694
Yes, now I claim your sun .

1812
02:17:25,988 --> 02:17:29,117
-Move !
-Enemy target, top of pyramid . Engage !

1813
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:30,743
<i>Engage! Engage!</i>

1814
02:17:36,207 --> 02:17:39,168
In moments, we'll be at firing strength .

1815
02:17:54,767 --> 02:17:59,313
All my Decepticon life, I never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1816
02:17:59,856 --> 02:18:02,775
Optimus, take my parts

1817
02:18:02,859 --> 02:18:06,028
and you will have a power
you've never known .

1818
02:18:06,988 --> 02:18:09,031
Fulfill your destiny.

1819
02:18:15,329 --> 02:18:17,165
Jolt! Electrify!

1820
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:19,542
Transplant those afterburners.

1821
02:18:37,894 --> 02:18:39,520
Let's roll .

1822
02:18:41,981 --> 02:18:44,066
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1823
02:18:55,912 --> 02:18:59,373
This planet will be dark forever.

1824
02:19:21,604 --> 02:19:24,023
Die, like your brothers !

1825
02:19:24,649 --> 02:19:26,901
They were your brothers, too.

1826
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:57,640
Starscream !

1827
02:20:10,653 --> 02:20:12,822
You picked the wrong planet.

1828
02:20:15,783 --> 02:20:17,660
Give me your face.

1829
02:20:26,168 --> 02:20:27,837
I rise.

1830
02:20:28,379 --> 02:20:30,006
You fall .

1831
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:35,219
No, no.

1832
02:20:37,305 --> 02:20:39,724
Not to call you a coward , Master,

1833
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:45,479
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1834
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:48,024
This isn't over.

1835
02:21:15,718 --> 02:21:18,596
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1836
02:21:20,222 --> 02:21:21,766
You said it first.

1837
02:22:12,942 --> 02:22:15,569
Thank you , Sam , for saving my life.

1838
02:22:16,862 --> 02:22:18,155
Welcome.

1839
02:22:18,948 --> 02:22:20,658
Thank you for believing in me.

1840
02:22:25,496 --> 02:22:30,042
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten</i>

1841
02:22:30,126 --> 02:22:33,546
<i>and a future we shall face together.</i>

1842
02:22:34,088 --> 02:22:36,507
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

1843
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:41,595
<i>and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,</i>

1844
02:22:41,679 --> 02:22:45,599
<i>for in those memories, we live on.</i>

1845
02:23:08,414 --> 02:23:11,292
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein .

1846
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:13,711
Yeah , I was kind of busy.

1847
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:17,590
Okay.
