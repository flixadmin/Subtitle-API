1
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,710
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,420
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,256
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,383
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,636
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,263
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,099
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,726
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,605
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,780
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,657
Thank you.

12
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,368
Any change?

13
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,246
No.

14
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,126
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,920
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:12,258
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,593
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,930
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:22,184
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,646
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,986
Roland, I'd like to run another
search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,405
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,783
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,285
Please, for me.

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,506
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,675
What?

27
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,554
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,640
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,144
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,159
The big <i>bupkes. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,536
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

32
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,249
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,044
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:34,840
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,177
Mauser, I want forward and
aft guns manned at all times.

36
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,471
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,515
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,810
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

39
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,355
Operator.

40
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,108
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,529
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,001
Good morning.

43
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,756
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,010
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,180
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:30,396
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,485
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,947
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,076
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,789
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,293
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,380
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,608
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,569
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,822
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,075
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:32,082
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,127
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,967
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,097
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,641
What choice?

63
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,936
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:57,024
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,028
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,781
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:08,244
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:12,289
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:17,169
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,674
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,387
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,723
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,352
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,689
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,691
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,404
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,158
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,079
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,748
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,586
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,217
Oracle...

82
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,595
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,515
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:16,312
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,230
I don't.

86
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,066
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:25,529
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:31,118
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,705
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,791
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,293
No.

92
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,380
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,551
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,472
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,140
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,649
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,611
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:10,491
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,660
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,454
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,084
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,338
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,007
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:32,096
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,848
It's okay.

106
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,684
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,396
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,357
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,861
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,239
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:54,368
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,413
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,542
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,962
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,755
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,884
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,637
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,848
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,309
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,229
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,195
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,907
I find her to be the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

123
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,785
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,621
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,167
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,004
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,925
- You do not understand.
- I just have never--

128
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,470
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,600
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:04,146
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,568
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,114
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,616
Anything.

134
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,785
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,246
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,881
That's him.

137
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,885
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,971
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,725
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,194
Oh, no!

141
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,166
Damn it!

142
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,215
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

143
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,593
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

144
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
You think it has something
to do with me?

145
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,722
I cannot say.

146
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,725
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

147
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,769
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

148
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,689
I consulted with her before
I met with the Frenchman.

149
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,400
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

150
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,569
Goodbye?

151
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,405
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

152
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,618
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

153
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,246
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

154
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,458
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

155
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,836
Karma is a word, like love.

156
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,796
A way of saying:

157
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,215
"What I am here to do."

158
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:41,011
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

159
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,640
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

160
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,936
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

161
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,982
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

162
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,946
Can I carry that for you?

163
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,157
All right.

164
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,872
Hurry it up, I'm late!

165
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,253
Who are you?

166
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,214
- He is a friend.
- Rama!

167
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,801
I know you.

168
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,680
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

169
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,245
I'll pay you whatever you want.

170
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:30,511
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

171
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,081
Oh, no, no, no.

172
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,816
You'll stay right here until
the Merovingian says different.

173
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,484
If I know him...

174
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,154
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

175
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,409
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

176
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,161
I built this place.

177
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,666
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

178
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,174
Down here, I'm God.

179
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,347
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

180
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,116
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

181
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,036
No. We know what has to be done.

182
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,136
Shit.

183
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,875
You gotta be kidding.

184
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,086
Holy shit, it's wingless.

185
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,421
I get it.

186
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,424
You must be ready to die.

187
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,259
I need to speak with him.

188
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,098
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

189
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,225
So be it.

190
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,875
There are no weapons
allowed in the club.

191
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,462
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

192
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,841
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

193
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,176
And if we're unlucky?

194
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,220
There will be many men.

195
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,724
Can I take your--? Oh, my God.

196
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,952
What in the hell?

197
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,540
I don't believe this.

198
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,382
Hey! Hey!

199
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,138
The prodigal child returns.

200
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:04,394
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

201
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,316
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

202
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,652
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

203
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,655
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

204
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:21,202
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hell to do so. Yes?

205
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,580
I'll tell you what I will do.

206
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,709
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

207
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,503
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

208
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,423
Of course.

209
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:05,205
Who could have guessed we'd see each
other so soon after our last meeting?

210
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,458
The Fates are too kind?

211
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,128
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

212
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:17,133
...I can only surmise the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

213
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,553
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

214
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,224
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

215
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,727
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

216
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:32,982
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

217
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,985
You know why we are here?

218
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,739
Come now, what kind of question
is this? Of course I know.

219
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,991
It is my business to know.

220
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,412
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

221
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:52,127
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

222
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,421
- Do you know?
- No.

223
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,339
No?

224
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,675
I did not think so.

225
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,761
But it is always best to ask?

226
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,013
We want to make a deal.

227
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,978
Always straight to business,
Morpheus?

228
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:14,482
Okay. I have something you want.

229
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,609
To make a deal...

230
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:22,323
...you must have something
I want, yes?

231
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:26,786
And it so happens
there is something I want.

232
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,332
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

233
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,294
It is said they cannot be taken...

234
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,046
...they can only be given.

235
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,548
What?

236
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,553
The eyes of the Oracle.

237
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,894
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

238
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,813
It is that nature that has
again brought you to me.

239
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,650
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

240
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,111
Where others see chance...

241
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,823
...I see cost.

242
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,287
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

243
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,749
...and I will give you back your savior.

244
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:17,670
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

245
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,756
Yes? No?

246
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,927
I don't have time for this shit.

247
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,419
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

248
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,674
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

249
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,553
Interesting deal.

250
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,560
You are really ready to die
for this man?

251
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,313
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

252
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,692
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

253
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,360
She's in love.

254
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,575
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

255
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,368
Time's up.

256
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,078
What's it gonna be, Merv?

257
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,587
Okay. You got yourself in here...

258
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,339
...you can get yourself out.

259
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,347
Are you ready for us?

260
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,475
Almost, sir. They got some
pretty ancient hacks here.

261
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,810
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

262
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,897
No, sir. We were reading something,
but I couldn't tell what.

263
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,986
I can't leave yet.

264
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,325
I have to see her.

265
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,244
Now?

266
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,747
It's my last chance.

267
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,710
That's it. That's the secret.

268
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,046
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

269
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,174
Cookies need love
like everything does.

270
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,427
Neo!

271
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:16,683
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

272
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,812
Sati, honey, I think it's
time for a tasting.

273
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,981
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

274
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,275
Okay.

275
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,404
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

276
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,661
So do you recognize me?

277
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,039
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

278
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,042
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

279
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,046
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

280
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,550
...but I still love candy.

281
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,387
No, thank you.

282
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,724
Remember what you were like when
you first walked through my door?

283
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,979
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

284
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,399
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

285
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,861
You gave me a few surprises too.

286
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,321
I hope I helped.

287
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,908
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

288
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,869
Where is this going?

289
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,580
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

290
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:24,250
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

291
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:29,756
...no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

292
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:34,260
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

293
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,929
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

294
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,099
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

295
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,517
Of course not.

296
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,895
Then why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

297
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:48,274
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

298
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:53,112
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

299
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,199
You know who.

300
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,124
I did.

301
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,961
Then I think it's time for me
to know a few more things.

302
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,880
So do I.

303
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,967
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

304
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,887
Tell me how I stopped four
sentinels by thinking it.

305
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:22,141
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

306
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,814
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

307
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,526
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

308
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,945
- Where?
- The source.

309
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:38,783
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

310
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:44,914
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

311
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,669
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

312
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,671
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

313
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:56,175
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

314
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,095
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

315
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,349
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

316
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,185
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

317
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:10,398
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

318
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,277
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

319
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,821
What's your purpose?

320
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,031
To unbalance it.

321
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,284
Why? What do you want?

322
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,371
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

323
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,457
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

324
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,460
The end of the war.

325
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,504
Is it going to end?

326
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,382
One way or another.

327
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,344
Can Zion be saved?

328
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,558
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

329
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:51,272
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

330
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,150
- Where?
- You know where.

331
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,238
And if you can't find the answer...

332
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,909
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

333
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:07,246
What does that mean?

334
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,879
Everything that has a beginning...

335
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,506
...has an end.

336
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,593
I see the end coming.

337
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,679
I see the darkness spreading.

338
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,264
I see death.

339
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:29,560
And you are all that stands in his way.

340
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,062
Smith.

341
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:36,359
Very soon, he is going to have
the power to destroy this world.

342
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,278
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

343
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,531
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

344
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,200
What is he?

345
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,285
He is you.

346
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,913
Your opposite, your negative.

347
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,667
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

348
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,879
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

349
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,925
...this war is going to end.

350
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:05,972
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

351
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,932
...or in his.

352
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,076
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

353
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,502
I need time.

354
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,760
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

355
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,263
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

356
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,598
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

357
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,608
I love that smell.

358
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,696
I sure am going to miss it.

359
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,408
- Oracle.
- I know.

360
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,909
I know.

361
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,787
Sati, honey.

362
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,207
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

363
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,169
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

364
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,714
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

365
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,886
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

366
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,910
I'm scared, Seraph.

367
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,455
Come.

368
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,334
He's following us.

369
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:48,300
Well, well, it's been a long time.

370
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,847
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

371
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,974
I have beaten you before.

372
00:32:55,474 --> 00:33:00,938
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

373
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,859
And you must be the last exile.

374
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,029
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

375
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,115
What did she say about me?

376
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,242
That you were a bad man.

377
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:18,247
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

378
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,447
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

379
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:58,704
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

380
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,290
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

381
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:04,627
How can she be? She knows everything.

382
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:09,506
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

383
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,717
Why wouldn't she leave?

384
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,725
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

385
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,479
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

386
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,356
...deliberately, purposefully...

387
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:29,568
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

388
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,446
What did you do with Sati?

389
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:37,743
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

390
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,247
You are a bastard.

391
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,416
You would know, Mom.

392
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,589
Do what you're here to do.

393
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,092
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:42,308
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

395
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,896
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

396
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,108
Yeah, definitely.

397
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,569
You're right about that, sir.

398
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,406
They look like they
might be self-inflicted.

399
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:01,827
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

400
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:06,832
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

401
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,670
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

402
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:20,554
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

403
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,433
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

404
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,936
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

405
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,940
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

406
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:36,945
I want the truth. I don't care what
it takes. Make him remember.

407
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,718
Sir, we found her.

408
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,220
- The <i>Logos</i>?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,472
About time we had some
goddamn good news.

410
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,588
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

411
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,258
No, sir. Nothing yet.

412
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:43,053
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's intact.

413
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,265
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,529
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

415
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,631
Careful, sir.

416
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:24,303
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

417
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,830
What was that?

418
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:57,002
You can put that shit away,
boys. All she needs is a jump.

419
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,673
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

420
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,013
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

421
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,016
We didn't know what
happened after...

422
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,979
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

423
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,190
I'm happy to see you too.

424
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,943
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

425
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,278
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

426
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,031
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

427
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:30,702
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

428
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,706
Exactly what I needed to hear.

429
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,211
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

430
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:43,882
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside...

431
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,718
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

432
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,887
Thus, our primary objective must be...

433
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:52,516
...to destroy or disable the
diggers inside the dock.

434
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:56,895
If we can do that, perhaps we can
prevent them from reaching the city.

435
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,232
If not, the only place we will
be able to mount a defense...

436
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,568
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

437
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,487
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

438
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,740
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

439
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,119
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

440
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,788
- That is correct.
- Precisely what size force...

441
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:18,208
...are you planning to commit
to the primary dock objective?

442
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,920
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

443
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,090
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councilor...

444
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,552
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

445
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,596
...and march them into that dock.

446
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,515
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

447
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,684
Time will tell, councilor.

448
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,604
Commander, just one more question.

449
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,064
Has there been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

450
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,693
None, and at this point there's no
reason to expect there will be.

451
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,862
Perhaps.

452
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,447
But we can hope.

453
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,034
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

454
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,882
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

455
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,718
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

456
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,220
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

457
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,891
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

458
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,980
Kids, you stay here.

459
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,318
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

460
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,487
- I have to.
- Why?

461
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,822
Because I love him.

462
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,867
I love him the same as he loves me.

463
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:37,371
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

464
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,833
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

465
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:47,172
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

466
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,218
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

467
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,512
...what would you do?

468
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,560
Make shells.

469
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,199
What the shit is going on over here?

470
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,911
An accident, sir. I didn't see--

471
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,205
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

472
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,666
A unit volunteer, sir.

473
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:27,045
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

474
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:31,216
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

475
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,678
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

476
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,973
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

477
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,558
Okay, I'm 16.

478
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:43,311
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

479
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:48,316
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

480
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,819
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

481
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,614
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

482
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,700
You do...

483
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,495
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

484
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,094
Okay, charge the igniter.

485
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,144
She lives again.

486
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,606
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

487
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:31,109
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

488
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,533
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

489
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,453
Looking good, except...

490
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,332
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

491
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,710
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

492
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,380
<i>- What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

493
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,383
The machines have
taken Junction 21.

494
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,429
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

495
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,224
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

496
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:06,978
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

497
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,149
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

498
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:17,489
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

499
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,157
No, it's not.

500
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,410
There's another way. A support line.

501
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,331
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

502
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:30,544
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

503
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,129
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

504
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,340
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

505
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,509
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

506
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,929
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

507
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:45,725
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

508
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,813
Hi.

509
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,027
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

510
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,990
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

511
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,284
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

512
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,704
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

513
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,540
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

514
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,458
To go where?

515
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,752
To the machine city.

516
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,551
I know it's difficult to understand.

517
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,262
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

518
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,889
I still have to go.

519
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,267
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

520
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,145
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

521
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,315
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

522
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,818
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

523
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,070
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

524
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,198
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

525
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,577
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

526
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:49,581
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

527
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,255
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

528
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,217
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

529
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,678
...with my ship
after that little speech.

530
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:08,266
- But for christsake, Niobe--
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

531
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,437
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

532
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,148
That's as good a plan as any.

533
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:19,069
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

534
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,786
Two ships, two directions.

535
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,122
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

536
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,960
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

537
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,836
Then why are you doing this?

538
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,048
I believe in him.

539
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,885
Thank you.

540
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,810
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

541
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,813
To make it easier for you to remember.

542
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,649
What if I don't want to remember?

543
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,735
Why would you want that?

544
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,989
What if I blew that EMP?

545
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,992
What if I did destroy those ships...

546
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:11,955
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

547
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,002
If I did that...

548
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,922
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

549
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:35,020
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

550
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:45,030
I'm ready.

551
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,116
Trinity...

552
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,703
...there's something I have to say.

553
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,625
Something you need to understand.

554
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,671
I know I'm supposed to go.

555
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,132
But beyond that...

556
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,552
...I don't know. I...

557
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,639
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

558
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:18,271
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

559
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:21,107
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

560
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,651
...that I was coming with you.

561
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,489
I'm scared, Trin.

562
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,783
So am I.

563
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,245
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

564
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,332
But I'll tell you something.

565
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:40,418
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

566
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,588
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

567
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,718
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

568
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,428
No.

569
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,305
Nothing.

570
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,987
<i>- Finished loading ammunition?</i>
- Just about.

571
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,490
Let's move it. We are out of time.

572
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,951
You're not leaving them anything?

573
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,286
He said he didn't need it.

574
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,627
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

575
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,879
Thank you.

576
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,637
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

577
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,222
Me too.

578
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,978
It was an honor, sir.

579
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:46,317
No, the honor is still mine.

580
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:03,251
<i>- We're ready, sir.</i>
- About damn time.

581
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,047
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

582
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,678
Bye, baby.

583
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,680
Take good care of them.

584
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,287
Ready?

585
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,088
Engine's still firing.

586
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,883
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

587
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:08,191
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

588
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:09,692
Bane.

589
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,987
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

590
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,156
Every time, I thought it was the last.

591
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:19,160
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

592
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:23,915
I really can't express just
how aggravating that can be.

593
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,252
What are you talking about?

594
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:32,674
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

595
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,776
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

596
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,196
You're gonna pay for that.

597
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,284
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
<i>- We got an emergency.</i>

598
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,953
- What is it, AK?
<i>- It's Maggie, sir.</i>

599
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,330
<i>She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.</i>

600
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:07,000
Goddamn it.

601
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:12,338
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

602
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,299
He fired that EMP.

603
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,136
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

604
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,222
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

605
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,226
- I know where he is.
- The <i>Logos.</i>

606
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,646
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

607
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,733
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

608
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,818
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

609
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,570
...he'll control another EMP.

610
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,908
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

611
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,162
Mr. Anderson.

612
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:49,000
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

613
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,002
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

614
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:54,130
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

615
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:57,175
...that appearances can be deceiving.

616
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:01,179
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

617
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,599
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

618
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,851
Don't do it.

619
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:11,230
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

620
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,692
Do it. If you don't,
he'll kill us both.

621
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:19,864
Look at him. He knows he
should do it, but he won't.

622
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,034
- He can't.
- Do it.

623
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,045
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

624
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,387
Let her go.

625
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,611
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

626
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:02,949
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

627
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,744
I do. I think of nothing else.

628
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,419
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

629
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:20,091
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

630
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:26,597
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

631
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,685
Disgusting.

632
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:36,607
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

633
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,283
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

634
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:52,748
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

635
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,876
Look past the flesh.

636
00:54:55,042 --> 00:55:00,381
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

637
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,470
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

638
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,764
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

639
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,809
There is nowhere I won't find you.

640
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:16,063
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

641
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,149
Inevitable.

642
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,986
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

643
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,821
This is it. It's gotta be.

644
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,535
Oh, no.

645
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,640
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

646
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,313
Blind messiah.

647
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,904
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

648
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,909
Helpless.

649
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:56,455
Pathetic.

650
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:03,671
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

651
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:10,428
I can see you.

652
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,106
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

653
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,191
It's not over.

654
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,000
- Trinity!
- Neo.

655
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,003
Neo.

656
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,134
Oh, no. Your eyes.

657
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,470
I'll be okay.

658
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,973
It's all right, Trin.

659
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:00,645
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

660
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,363
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

661
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:14,200
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

662
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:19,038
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

663
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,748
Yes, sir.

664
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,280
Come on, move.

665
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,064
All right!

666
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,066
This is it.

667
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:34,321
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

668
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,909
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

669
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:44,582
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

670
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:47,585
...we give them hell before we do!

671
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

672
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,438
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

673
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,024
But I'll make you a deal.

674
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:13,736
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

675
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,865
Deal.

676
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,294
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

677
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:33,672
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

678
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:38,552
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

679
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,473
- Full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

680
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,820
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

681
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,033
If we can just get close enough...

682
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:06,914
Six hundred meters.

683
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,667
There.

684
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,843
Shit!

685
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,597
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

686
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:26,559
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

687
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,437
Ghost, you're the best gunner we have,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

688
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:50,207
I'm coming, baby.

689
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,051
Here they come.

690
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:09,476
<i>- Slow down, this ain't the</i> Logos.
- Hang on to your lunch, here we go.

691
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,280
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

692
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,667
Breach! The dock is breached!

693
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,648
Knuckle up!

694
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,579
For Zion!

695
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,459
Shit.

696
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:09,424
Come on, let's go.

697
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,557
Knuckle up!

698
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,031
Reload!

699
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,660
Reload nine!

700
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,668
Go, go! Move, move!

701
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,682
Watch your left!

702
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,019
Don't let them through!

703
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,565
Zuka!

704
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,312
Oh, my God.

705
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:02,496
Where the hell's my infantry? I want
that goddamn machine taken down!

706
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,781
Dig this!

707
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,287
Oh, shit!

708
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:04,891
- Yeah!
- Bogey two at the breach point!

709
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,310
Goddamn it!

710
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,504
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

711
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:47,267
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

712
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,802
- Captain, you see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

713
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:30,894
Damn it!

714
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,212
Yeah.

715
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,809
Grab my belt.

716
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,696
Just give me one clean shot.

717
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,288
Damn it!

718
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,061
Charra!

719
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,694
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

720
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:05,322
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

721
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,699
I think it's one of ours, sir.

722
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,827
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

723
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,746
Contact them.
I want access codes.

724
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,457
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

725
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,503
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

726
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:23,507
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

727
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,020
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

728
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:43,109
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

729
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:48,949
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

730
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:11,638
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the <i>Hammer</i>, sir.

731
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,473
How can that be?

732
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,642
It's under attack,
sustaining damage.

733
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,603
At present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

734
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,147
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

735
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:25,402
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

736
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,821
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

737
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,282
Sir, we already lost the dock.

738
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:35,787
Open the gate.

739
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:41,835
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

740
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:44,254
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

741
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,348
There's the exit.

742
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:58,977
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

743
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,229
Full power...

744
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,814
...ninety degrees.

745
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,447
Now!

746
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,956
Hold on, baby.

747
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,463
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

748
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,632
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

749
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:32,761
Sentinels are inside the dock.

750
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,430
Are we too late?

751
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,754
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

752
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,923
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

753
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,577
Reload!

754
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,079
He's pissing metal.

755
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,084
Go!

756
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,933
Go!

757
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,623
Heads up! They're coming around!

758
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,180
Behind you!

759
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,570
It's jammed!

760
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:04,037
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

761
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,790
Got it!

762
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,153
Captain Mifune.

763
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,200
Oh, no.

764
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,035
They're coming.

765
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:47,997
They're coming.

766
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,583
The <i>Hammer.</i>

767
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,502
What?

768
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:55,713
You have to open that gate.

769
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,174
Cut the counterweights.

770
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,678
You can do it.

771
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:05,223
Hurry. There's no time.

772
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,017
Captain...

773
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,562
...I didn't finish the training program.

774
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,567
Neither did I.

775
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:40,049
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

776
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:43,595
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

777
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,890
Come on, someone, please.

778
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,489
Keep the weight forward.

779
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,243
Light as a feather.
Light as a feather.

780
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:15,627
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's
APU is up and moving to Gate Three.

781
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:23,718
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

782
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,439
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

783
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:39,400
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

784
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:43,905
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

785
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,531
Mifune...

786
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,325
...this is Lock.

787
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,411
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

788
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,914
<i>...the</i> Hammer<i>'s two minutes away.</i>

789
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:57,669
<i>You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.</i>

790
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,713
Link.

791
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,466
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

792
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:41,754
Do it, kid.

793
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:48,678
Neo. I believe.

794
01:20:57,729 --> 01:20:59,772
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

795
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,192
We ain't come this far.

796
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,623
Almost home, almost home.

797
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,644
Burn it, Link!

798
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,755
- You did it.
- No.

799
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,757
We did it.

800
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,176
You're a hell of a pilot.

801
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:16,099
Some things in this world never change.

802
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,809
But some things do?

803
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,062
Luckily...

804
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,189
...some things do.

805
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:36,119
Link!

806
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,454
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

807
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,297
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

808
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,967
I made a promise.

809
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,144
You did wear it.

810
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,482
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

811
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,202
Three captains, one ship.

812
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:22,373
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

813
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,167
Good to see you too, Jason.

814
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,669
The Council's waiting to hear
your explanation.

815
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,007
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

816
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,343
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

817
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,345
That's the problem with you people.

818
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,098
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

819
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,977
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

820
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:46,105
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

821
01:23:46,397 --> 01:23:50,026
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

822
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,783
Come on, get it cut.

823
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,703
The bridge is clear.

824
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:05,208
Do you hear that?

825
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,086
Get that cable run!

826
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:13,090
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

827
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,761
Order everyone to fall back.

828
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:19,639
Seal the shaft. Now.

829
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,058
Move it!

830
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:27,063
Oh, my God.

831
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:37,406
- All clear.
- Do it.

832
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,742
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

833
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,635
Your move.

834
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,471
So you gave them your ship?

835
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:05,101
- That is correct, councilor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

836
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,604
The Oracle said nothing of this?

837
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:14,110
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

838
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:18,948
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

839
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:22,326
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

840
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:26,789
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

841
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:29,792
No, he wasn't.

842
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,297
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

843
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:38,926
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

844
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:41,721
...if he'll reach the machine city.

845
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,141
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

846
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:51,188
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

847
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,692
...he will not give up.

848
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,486
And neither can we.

849
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,328
Temperature's dropping.

850
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,166
Here we go.

851
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,457
We're over the fields, aren't we?

852
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,210
How do you know that?

853
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,837
I can feel them.

854
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,223
Over there.

855
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:11,894
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

856
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:13,396
Power lines.

857
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:16,148
Follow them.

858
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,959
What are they doing?

859
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,836
I don't know.

860
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,630
Lieutenant?

861
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,105
Goddamn it.

862
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,773
What do we do now?

863
01:28:02,445 --> 01:28:04,572
It is now a matter of time.

864
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,825
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

865
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,622
I recommend that the Council join the
non-military personnel inside the temple.

866
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,666
How long do we have?

867
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,836
Two hours. Maybe less.

868
01:28:20,588 --> 01:28:24,800
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

869
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,180
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

870
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,142
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

871
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:37,313
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

872
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,815
I would ask him.

873
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:44,361
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

874
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:54,163
There. Those mountains.

875
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,916
That's it.

876
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,171
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

877
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,341
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

878
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:07,176
We'll make it.

879
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,889
We have to.

880
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,880
Sentinels.

881
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:39,602
There's too many!

882
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:57,620
Gotcha!

883
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:00,497
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

884
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:03,125
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

885
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,378
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

886
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:10,090
Then up we go.

887
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,169
Beautiful.

888
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:11,694
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

889
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:21,578
Again. Slowly.

890
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,041
Now!

891
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:53,068
Trin?

892
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:56,905
Trinity?

893
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:59,658
Trinity?

894
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,911
- I'm here.
- Where?

895
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:04,413
Here.

896
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,091
We made it.

897
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:19,678
You said we would.

898
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,433
It's unbelievable, Trin.

899
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:27,102
Light everywhere.

900
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:30,272
Like the whole thing was built of light.

901
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,108
I wish you could see what I see.

902
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:36,779
You've already shown me so much.

903
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:42,367
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

904
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:46,246
I can't go with you, Neo.

905
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:49,708
I've gone as far as I can.

906
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,376
What?

907
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:55,798
Oh, no.

908
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:58,383
Oh, no. No, no.

909
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:00,803
It's all right.

910
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:03,806
It's time.

911
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,893
I've done all that I could do.

912
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,480
Now you have to do the rest.

913
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:14,316
You have to finish it.

914
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,819
You have to save Zion.

915
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,987
I can't.

916
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:22,783
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

917
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:24,993
You will.

918
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:29,164
I believe it. I always have.

919
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,293
Trinity.

920
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:39,007
Trinity, you can't die.

921
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:43,136
You can't.

922
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,013
You can't.

923
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,349
Yes, I can.

924
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,938
You brought me back once.

925
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:57,234
But not this time.

926
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,033
Do you remember...

927
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,746
...on that roof, after you caught me...

928
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:13,125
...the last thing I said to you?

929
01:35:15,878 --> 01:35:17,379
You said, "I'm sorry."

930
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:20,841
I wish I hadn't.

931
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:26,179
That was my last thought.

932
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:31,393
I wished I had one more chance...

933
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:34,563
...to say what really mattered.

934
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,985
To say how much I loved you.

935
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:45,741
How grateful I was for every
moment I was with you.

936
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:53,498
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

937
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,090
But you brought me back.

938
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:07,262
You gave me my wish.

939
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:14,603
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

940
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:21,151
Kiss me.

941
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,906
Once more...

942
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,034
...kiss me.

943
01:36:56,395 --> 01:36:58,480
Get that ammunition
where it belongs!

944
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:00,482
You got one chance to get this right.

945
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,985
Get that damn thing mounted!

946
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,575
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

947
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:26,800
Neo...

948
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:29,511
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

949
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,392
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

950
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:44,396
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

951
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:49,860
Speak.

952
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:53,572
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

953
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:57,159
Soon he will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

954
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:58,660
You cannot stop him.

955
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,081
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

956
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:06,418
We need nothing!

957
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:11,423
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

958
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:18,388
What do you want?

959
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,057
Peace.

960
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,793
What are they doing?

961
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,384
What are you doing?

962
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:01,473
Morpheus!

963
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,832
And if you fail?

964
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,087
I won't.

965
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:55,110
Neo.

966
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:56,903
He fights for us.

967
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,573
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

968
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,908
We missed you.

969
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:50,915
You like what I've done with the place?

970
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,209
It ends tonight.

971
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:57,172
I know it does. I've seen it.

972
01:42:57,339 --> 01:43:01,092
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

973
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:04,929
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

974
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:00,128
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

975
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:02,714
...closing in on you?

976
01:45:02,881 --> 01:45:05,049
Oh, I can.

977
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:10,513
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

978
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:14,309
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

979
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:18,229
The purpose of life is to end.

980
01:48:54,112 --> 01:48:56,030
Why, Mr. Anderson?

981
01:48:56,197 --> 01:49:00,034
Why, why, why?

982
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:01,536
Why do you do it?

983
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:04,288
Why? Why get up?

984
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,290
Why keep fighting?

985
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,294
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

986
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:13,131
For more than your survival?

987
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:16,592
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

988
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:21,806
Is it freedom or truth?

989
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:24,350
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

990
01:49:24,517 --> 01:49:27,895
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

991
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:31,399
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

992
01:49:31,566 --> 01:49:34,193
...trying desperately
to justify an existence...

993
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,446
...that is without meaning or purpose!

994
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:40,032
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

995
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:46,330
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

996
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,960
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

997
01:49:51,127 --> 01:49:55,673
You must know it by now. You can't
win. It's pointless to keep fighting.

998
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:01,679
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

999
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:07,185
Because I choose to.

1000
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:15,211
This is my world! My world!

1001
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:41,612
Wait.

1002
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,948
I've seen this.

1003
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:47,451
This is it. This is the end.

1004
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:53,040
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

1005
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:55,543
And I... I...

1006
01:51:55,710 --> 01:52:01,549
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

1007
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:03,384
I say:

1008
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:07,054
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

1009
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:19,567
What? What did I just say?

1010
01:52:24,906 --> 01:52:28,743
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1011
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,919
Get away from me!

1012
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,503
What are you afraid of?

1013
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:41,589
It's a trick.

1014
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,508
You were right, Smith.

1015
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:47,261
You were always right.

1016
01:52:50,598 --> 01:52:52,266
It was inevitable.

1017
01:53:24,048 --> 01:53:25,633
Is it over?

1018
01:53:56,664 --> 01:53:59,041
Oh, no, no, no.

1019
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:00,751
No, it's not fair.

1020
01:54:55,056 --> 01:54:57,391
It is done.

1021
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:31,675
It doesn't make sense.

1022
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:37,264
He did it.

1023
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:40,267
He saved us.

1024
01:55:40,518 --> 01:55:42,686
He saved us.

1025
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:46,524
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1026
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:48,109
He did it! It's over!

1027
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,778
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1028
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:54,448
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1029
01:55:54,615 --> 01:55:56,117
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1030
01:55:56,283 --> 01:55:58,202
The machines, they're gone.

1031
01:55:58,369 --> 01:56:01,705
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1032
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:06,710
Zion! Zion!

1033
01:56:06,877 --> 01:56:08,629
Zion, it's over!

1034
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:10,464
It's over!

1035
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:13,300
The war is over!

1036
01:56:13,467 --> 01:56:16,303
The war is over!

1037
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:40,578
I have imagined this moment...

1038
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:43,372
...for so long.

1039
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:49,044
Is this real?

1040
01:56:57,845 --> 01:57:00,681
Neo, wherever you are...

1041
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:03,767
...thank you.

1042
01:57:47,561 --> 01:57:48,896
Good morning.

1043
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:14,088
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1044
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:16,674
You played a very dangerous game.

1045
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,093
Change always is.

1046
01:58:19,677 --> 01:58:23,013
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last'?

1047
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:26,600
As long as it can.

1048
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:31,855
What about the others?

1049
01:58:33,524 --> 01:58:34,942
What others?

1050
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:36,777
The ones that want out.

1051
01:58:37,528 --> 01:58:39,613
Obviously, they will be freed.

1052
01:58:40,197 --> 01:58:41,865
I have your word?

1053
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:45,786
What do you think I am? Human?

1054
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,385
Oracle!

1055
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:10,394
We were afraid we might not find you.

1056
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:13,230
Everything's okay now.

1057
01:59:13,731 --> 01:59:15,482
Look, look.

1058
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:18,485
Just look at that.

1059
01:59:19,153 --> 01:59:21,822
Beautiful.

1060
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:25,159
Did you do that?

1061
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:27,661
For Neo.

1062
01:59:27,995 --> 01:59:29,997
That's nice.

1063
01:59:30,164 --> 01:59:31,832
I know he'd love it.

1064
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:34,501
Will we ever see him again?

1065
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:37,838
I suspect so.

1066
01:59:38,005 --> 01:59:39,715
Someday.

1067
01:59:44,511 --> 01:59:46,305
Did you always know?

1068
01:59:46,472 --> 01:59:49,767
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1069
01:59:50,267 --> 01:59:52,853
But I believed.

1070
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:56,190
I believed.
