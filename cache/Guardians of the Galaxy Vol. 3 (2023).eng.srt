1
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,196
<i>When you were here before</i>

2
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,829
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

3
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,796
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

4
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,634
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

5
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,136
<i>You float like a feather</i>

6
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,268
<i>In a beautiful world</i>

7
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,603
<i>And wish I was special</i>

8
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,148
Come on, Drax. Dance.

9
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,698
Only idiots dance.

10
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,578
<i>And I'm a creep</i>

11
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,999
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

12
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,798
<i>What the hell am I doin' here?</i>

13
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,969
<i>I don't belong here</i>

14
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,601
<i>I want to have control</i>

15
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,279
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

16
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,110
<i>I want a perfect soul</i>

17
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,789
<i>I want you to notice</i>

18
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,378
<i>When I'm not around</i>

19
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,388
<i>You're so very special</i>

20
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,054
<i>I wish I was special</i>

21
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,933
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

22
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,733
Hey! Uh-uh.

23
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,196
I told you a million times,

24
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,151
you keep your grimy
raccoon hands off my Zune.

25
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,205
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

26
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,953
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

27
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,585
<i>When I don't belong here</i>

28
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,512
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

29
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,893
Again?

30
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:42,314
<i>Ah, she's runnin' out</i>

31
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:49,404
<i>She run, run, run, run</i>

32
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,667
<i>Whatever makes you happy</i>

33
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,919
<i>Whatever you want</i>

34
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,129
I love you, Gamora.

35
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,642
<i>You're so very special</i>

36
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,014
<i>I wish I was special</i>

37
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,736
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

38
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,243
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

39
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,911
<i>What the hell am I doing here?</i>

40
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,712
<i>I don't belong here</i>

41
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,839
<i>I don't belong here</i>

42
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,975
So, what are you
gonna do about Quill?

43
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,927
Me? Why not you?

44
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,104
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,477
Why are you on the ceiling?

46
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,275
I wanted to see if
these new gravity boots

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,361
worked on a slope.

48
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,570
Here we go.

49
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,170
Oh.

50
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
Sorry.

51
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,758
<i>Bozhe moi,</i> Kraglin.

52
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,639
You must know
you will never learn.

53
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,970
You think you could do better?

54
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,097
<i>Da.</i>

55
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,224
<i>Davaj.</i>

56
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,872
Telekinesis is cheating!

57
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,916
That's a stupid little pebble!

58
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,089
I could do that
with my dang finger!

59
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,009
You're a bad dog.

60
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,756
Do not say that to me.

61
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,337
You are. You're a bad dog.

62
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,547
Take that back.

63
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,303
Come on, that's not cool.

64
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,555
Nebula, did you hear?

65
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,353
He called me a bad dog,

66
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,804
and he refused to take it back.

67
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,435
I don't care, Cosmo.

68
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,603
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

69
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,937
- What are you going to do?
- Me? He's your brother.

70
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,238
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

71
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,113
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

72
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,489
She's not dead.

73
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,161
She just doesn't
remember anything

74
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,247
from the past few years.

75
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,618
Nobody tells me nothing.

76
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,619
Mantis, why don't you
just touch him and,

77
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,792
- you know, make him happy?
- I am Groot?

78
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,960
- Dude!
- Gross!

79
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,960
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

80
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,542
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

81
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,843
'Bout that time you made me
fall in love with my sock?

82
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,295
Well, that was funny.

83
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,921
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

84
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,182
Maybe we should draw straws.

85
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,179
No one ever meant that, Drax.

86
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,001
<i>If we still have time
We might still get by</i>

87
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,630
<i>Every time I think about it
I wanna cry</i>

88
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,381
<i>With bombs and the Devil
And the kids keep comin'</i>

89
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,179
<i>No way to breathe easy
No time to be young</i>

90
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:47,182
<i>Bu! I tell myself
That I was doin ' all right'</i>

91
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,394
<i>There's nothin' left
To do at night</i>

92
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,223
- What was that?
- What was that?

93
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,954
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

94
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,156
Is he okay?

95
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,301
Hey!

96
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,134
Where did you go, squirrel?

97
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,136
On the ground!

98
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,538
No, stop! Don't!

99
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,079
Stop, please! No!
Stop, please!

100
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,288
Please!

101
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,039
Who is that maniac?

102
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,575
Some super douche
with ray gun hands,

103
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,001
I don't frickin' know.

104
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,853
Who threw this thing at me?

105
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,868
Shut up.

106
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,213
Baby.

107
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,850
Pick on someone your own size.

108
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,373
Peter!

109
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,126
Peter!

110
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,461
We need Med-Paks!

111
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,859
Nebula!

112
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,946
Piss off.

113
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,457
Ooh.

114
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,961
Rocket.

115
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,400
That hurts.

116
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,489
What a pity.

117
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,586
No!

118
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,017
All I did was
activate the Med-Paks!

119
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,639
Get them off! Now!

120
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,180
Oh, hell.

121
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,419
We need to get him
to the Med-Bay!

122
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,275
It was destroyed.
There's one on the ship.

123
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,275
Lill ol od for today.

124
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,200
Stitch him up and transfer him
in with the rest of Batch 89.

125
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,571
It's okay.

126
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,569
You're here with us now.

127
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,951
Hey! It's a new guy.

128
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,778
What kind of thing are you?

129
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,616
You've got, like,
a mask on your face.

130
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,500
Mask, eyes, face, mouth,

131
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,297
does it words?

132
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,007
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

133
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,093
Hurts.

134
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,709
It's okay.

135
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,256
You're gonna be okay.

136
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,673
A kill switch?

137
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,880
A device set to destruct

138
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,760
if anyone goes
poking around inside him,

139
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,137
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

140
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,013
And why would Rocket
have a kill switch?

141
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,304
Apparently, someone considers
him proprietary technology

142
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,848
and sent that golden lunatic
to get him.

143
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,524
So, he'll die
if we operate on him?

144
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,651
And he'll die if we don't.

145
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,006
There has to be some way
to bypass it.

146
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,270
It looks like there's a passkey

147
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,723
that could override
the kill switch.

148
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,940
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

149
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,321
He won't talk about it.

150
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,771
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

151
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,950
And there's a code on all of it,

152
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,661
89P13.

153
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,743
He's got maybe 48 hours.

154
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,423
Where are you going?

155
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,964
OrgoCorp have to
have records, right?

156
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,320
Maybe they'll have a way for us

157
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,255
to override the kill switch
and save Rocket.

158
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,865
They won't just
give us that information.

159
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,366
Well, that's why
we're gonna break in.

160
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,381
We kill anyone
who gets in our way!

161
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,217
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

162
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,346
Kill no people.

163
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,804
Kill one guy, one stupid guy
who no one loves.

164
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,639
Now you're just making it sad.

165
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,104
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch

166
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,093
<i>over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.</i>

167
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,448
- Aye, Cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

168
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,371
Take back what you said,

169
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,866
- that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

170
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,198
I know you don't really
think I am a bad dog.

171
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,749
Can you please take it back?

172
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,835
I will not.

173
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,879
I located the coordinates
for OrgoCorp.

174
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,377
I think I have
a contact near there.

175
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,707
Maybe they can help us get in.

176
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,008
Contact him.

177
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,419
Let's go save our friend.

178
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,323
<i>I get the same old dreams
Same time every night</i>

179
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,493
<i>Fall to the ground And I wake up</i>

180
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,203
<i>So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head</i>

181
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,831
<i>Thoughts fly back
To the break-up</i>

182
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,504
<i>These four walls Are closing in</i>

183
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,753
<i>Look at the fix You've put me in</i>

184
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,637
<i>Since you been gone</i>

185
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,883
No, no, no.

186
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,759
<i>Since you been gone</i>

187
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,093
<i>I'm out of my head Can't take it</i>

188
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,605
<i>Could I be wrong
But since you been gone</i>

189
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,858
<i>You cast the spell So break it</i>

190
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

191
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,446
It's good to have friends.

192
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,825
<i>Since you been gone</i>

193
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,412
Oh, my poor baby.

194
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,914
It hurts.

195
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,001
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

196
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,883
I tried to warn you,
High Evolutionary.

197
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,423
These Guardians are
more powerful than you think.

198
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,600
Or perhaps you simply
overestimate your own value,

199
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,177
High Priestess.

200
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,932
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

201
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,939
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

202
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,895
Beautiful numbskulls.

203
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,110
But your egos have run wild.
Say, "Ah."

204
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,526
- Ah.
- And this one

205
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,236
was meant to be the Warlock,

206
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,912
the apogee of their people.

207
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,365
You removed Adam
from his cocoon early,

208
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,540
<i>my “egg</i>

209
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,205
He's still a child.

210
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,785
No, there's something
wrong with him

211
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,961
even outside all that.

212
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,692
Yes, there's something
wrong with me!

213
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,048
I was stabbed,
you extraordinary phallus!

214
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,259
He doesn't know any better.

215
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,783
We shall do whatever
you require, my liege.

216
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,266
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

217
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,263
That's not what I require!

218
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,389
I'm sorry, my liege.

219
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,567
Find 89P13 and return it to me,

220
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,237
or I will destroy
your entire civilization,

221
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,735
as is my right as your maker.

222
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,567
Do you understand?

223
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,782
Do you understand?

224
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,246
Yes, sire.

225
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,839
Toodle-do.

226
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,589
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

227
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,169
It was always clever, sire.

228
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,096
Yes, that's exactly why
I want it now.

229
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,843
- Of course.
- Lts brain.

230
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,221
That is the only reason, sire.

231
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,637
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

232
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,305
They're merely a backup.

233
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,357
I believe I know
where they're going.

234
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,972
It's bio-formed.

235
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,645
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

236
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,689
The structure is surrounded

237
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,234
by three impenetrable
plasmic security shields.

238
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
It's not going to be easy

239
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,798
to break into this place,
Star-Lord.

240
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,822
Doesn't have to be easy.

241
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,739
I was a professional thief,
remember?

242
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,281
I'll jam the signals
one at a time.

243
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,279
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

244
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,533
She's always mad

245
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,456
at everyone.

246
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,242
It's because I was drunk.

247
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,629
She's right.

248
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,796
If I hadn't been drinking,

249
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,878
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

250
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,377
It's okay.
He's your best friend.

251
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,803
Second best friend.

252
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,760
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

253
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,934
Gamora isn't dead.

254
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,012
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

255
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,222
Thank you.

256
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,941
First shield set.

257
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,277
Three, two,

258
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,119
one.

259
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,835
- Peter.
- What?

260
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,085
You had family on Earth,

261
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,082
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

262
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,088
No, you're my sister.

263
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,916
That's all the family
I want or need.

264
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,001
Besides, it was really
just my grandpa, okay?

265
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,586
He was a pretty hard guy.

266
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,513
Still. Don't you think he...

267
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
What?

268
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,924
You were abducted by Ravagers

269
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,056
the same day
he lost his daughter.

270
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,557
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

271
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,042
My mom died,
he screamed in my face,

272
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,210
he pushed me out of the room!

273
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,566
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

274
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,360
- What are you talking about?
- What?

275
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,674
I'm talking about the people
in my life who died,

276
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,758
and you're talking about this?

277
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,782
Second shield set.

278
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,609
Three, two, one.

279
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,743
I'm only saying,

280
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,201
you've never even
gone to see if he's okay.

281
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,660
He could still be alive.

282
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,585
My grandpa? He'd be, like,
90-something years old.

283
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,165
So he could still be alive.

284
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,046
People on Earth die
when they're, like, 50.

285
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,835
They die when they're 50?

286
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,637
I don't know.
Something like that.

287
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,431
What's even
the point of being born?

288
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,259
- Exactly!
- Are you about to die?

289
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,220
I'm not 50!

290
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,397
The point is,

291
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,771
I wasn't talking
about any of this.

292
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,736
Third shield set.

293
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,736
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

294
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,574
Well, not everything

295
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,402
is about
what you are talking about.

296
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,742
And I'm only saying
you are upset

297
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,823
because so many of the people
you cared about

298
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,079
have left you...

299
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,785
but you also left someone.

300
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,127
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

301
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,206
It's too late.
They're all gone.

302
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,390
Why didn't we go through?

303
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,476
We did. It's not the shield.

304
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,022
Oh, hell.

305
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,535
Ravagers.

306
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,409
<i>Hey, guys,
you're about to be boarded</i>

307
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,036
<i>by the United Ravagers.</i>

308
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,354
<i>You can surrender and turn over</i>

309
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,868
<i>any stuff
worth anything and live...</i>

310
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,874
<i>or you can die.</i>

311
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,000
<i>Totes up to you.</i>

312
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,681
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

313
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,856
- Mwah.
- Guys, it's me,

314
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,170
Peter Quill, I'm one of you,
remember?

315
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,105
Hold on!
We have an appointment!

316
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,937
- We have an appointment.
- With who?

317
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,147
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

318
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,700
- What?
- You're early.

319
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,177
What are these?

320
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,670
OrgoCorp uniforms.

321
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,052
You're gonna have to wear
these to move through the Orgo

322
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,350
without attracting attention.

323
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,677
This isn't my color.

324
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,435
What did you say?

325
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,187
It clashes with my eyes.

326
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,147
Put it on!

327
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,367
Nebula, why would you
not tell me

328
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,365
that you've been in contact
with Gamora?

329
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,017
Because I didn't want you
to get freaked out.

330
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,122
Freaked out how?

331
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,323
Like that.

332
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,918
Let me in there.

333
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,763
I don't wanna be trapped
out here, I can't...

334
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,045
Gamora, we are grateful
for your help.

335
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,715
Oh, I'm not doing this out
of the kindness of my heart.

336
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,254
I'm doing this
for the hundred thousand units

337
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,551
my sister promised.

338
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,221
So, you're a Ravager now?

339
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,808
Put on the uniform.

340
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,554
Never pictured you
as the Ravager type.

341
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,094
Who are you again?

342
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,679
Oh, man.

343
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,983
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced

344
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,982
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy,

345
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:18,108
<i>so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.</i>

346
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,740
<i>Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock,</i>

347
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,992
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

348
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,956
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records,

349
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,333
where maybe
you can find the passkey

350
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,710
to override the kill switch

351
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,883
and help you save the hedgehog.

352
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,294
But if you get into trouble,

353
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,756
we will not
be able to bail you out.

354
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,232
Yes.

355
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,160
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

356
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,790
His functioning has skyrocketed.

357
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,121
That's correct, P13.

358
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,546
Very good.

359
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,262
That's the new world.

360
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,714
Counter-Earth.

361
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,805
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

362
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,181
It blue.

363
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,353
That's the sky.

364
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,846
Sky.

365
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,069
Rocket.

366
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,727
Yes, it is.

367
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,863
What sounds?

368
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,484
That's music.

369
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,578
We like it?

370
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,118
We do.

371
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,240
This recording
is over 5,000 years old.

372
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,914
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

373
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,205
Which, translated, is,

374
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,838
"Be not as you are,
but as you should be."

375
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,090
It's our sacred mission,

376
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,014
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

377
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,263
and turn it into a song.

378
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,646
To take an imperfect clump

379
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,521
of biological matter such as you

380
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,603
and transform it into something

381
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,281
perfect.

382
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,739
And we're halfway there,
aren't we?

383
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,581
Come with me, P13.

384
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,705
I'd like to show you something.

385
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,999
<i>We have but a single quest,</i>

386
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,919
to create the perfect species

387
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,095
and the perfect society.

388
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,674
You, P13,

389
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,183
are part of Batch 89.

390
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,637
But here with Batch 90,

391
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,190
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

392
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,859
any organism
through millions of years

393
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,529
of programmed
evolutionary changes

394
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,532
in a moment.

395
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,266
See, now, there's the rub.

396
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,814
For some reason,

397
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,067
these specimens
are also over-producing

398
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,946
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems,

399
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,743
causing them to be, well...

400
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,992
Violent. We don't like it.

401
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,244
A utopia can't have its denizens

402
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,950
murdering one another, can it?

403
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,253
It can'ts.

404
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,171
Can't.

405
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,464
Can't.

406
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,841
Theel.

407
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,887
They're programmed
to be peaceful. Like you.

408
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,432
But for some reason,
it's not catching.

409
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,227
Hyptonic filters.

410
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,314
What?

411
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,395
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

412
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,568
And then boop-boop-boop,

413
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,021
halfcystine residual be formin',

414
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,607
and then, they make, um...

415
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,201
What do you say?

416
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,323
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

417
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,955
Yeah, thems.

418
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,789
And then, angry turtleses.

419
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,790
Huh.

420
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,283
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh Oooh ooooh</i>

421
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,449
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh Oooh ooooh</i>

422
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,374
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh Oooh ooooh</i>

423
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,416
<i>There. That's
the decompression chamber.</i>

424
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,053
<i>Lock in.</i>

425
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,014
<i>And in the end
We shall achieve in time</i>

426
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,308
<i>The thing they call divine</i>

427
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,308
<i>When all the stars
Will smile for me</i>

428
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,433
Go.

429
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,560
<i>When all is well
And well is all for all</i>

430
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,611
<i>And forever after</i>

431
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:53,067
<i>Well, maybe in the meantime
Wait and see</i>

432
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,284
<i>We love the all The all of you</i>

433
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,581
<i>Where lands are green
And skies are blue</i>

434
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,799
<i>When all in all
We're just like you</i>

435
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,465
<i>Activate gravity boots
and gloves.</i>

436
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,852
<i>And when I cry for me
I cry for you</i>

437
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,229
<i>Nebula, go.</i>

438
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,807
<i>For all the days
You've still to come</i>

439
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,609
<i>And did I ever say
I'd never play</i>

440
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,569
<i>Or fly toward the sun</i>

441
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,281
<i>Maybe in the meantime
Something's wrong</i>

442
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,083
<i>We love the all The all of you</i>

443
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,797
<i>Where lands are green
And skies are blue</i>

444
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,804
<i>So, you really don't
remember anything?</i>

445
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,895
<i>Like what?</i>

446
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,813
<i>'Bout your time with us.</i>

447
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,938
No.

448
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,275
<i>- Huh. We were...
- We weren't anything.</i>

449
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,653
<i>You and me...</i>

450
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,322
<i>That person was some alternate
future version of me.</i>

451
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,899
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

452
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,490
<i>We loved each other.</i>

453
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,947
<i>I don't think so.</i>

454
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,413
<i>I know you don't remember
any of it.</i>

455
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,043
<i>You were everything to me.</i>

456
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,300
<i>And I miss you...</i>

457
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,137
<i>so much.</i>

458
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,556
<i>And, maybe...</i>

459
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,010
<i>maybe, if you
open yourself up to it...</i>

460
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:45,979
<i>there's a possibility...</i>

461
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,648
<i>I don't think so, Quinn.</i>

462
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
<i>Quill.</i>

463
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,026
<i>Quill.</i>

464
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,153
<i>I don't think so.</i>

465
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,426
<i>Well, what I'm trying to say...</i>

466
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,782
<i>Peter, you know this is
an open line, right?</i>

467
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,984
<i>What?</i>

468
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,681
<i>We're listening to everything
you're saying.</i>

469
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,696
<i>And it is painful.</i>

470
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,031
<i>And you're just telling me now?</i>

471
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,394
<i>We were hoping
it would stop on its own.</i>

472
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,738
<i>But I switched it over
to private!</i>

473
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,160
<i>What color button did you push?</i>

474
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,337
<i>- Blue, for the blue suit!
- Oh, no!</i>

475
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,255
<i>Blue is the open line
for everyone.</i>

476
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,083
<i>- Orange is for blue.
- What?</i>

477
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,669
<i>Black is for orange,
yellow is for green,</i>

478
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,255
<i>green is for red,
and red is for yellow.</i>

479
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,805
<i>No. Yellow is for yellow,</i>

480
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,553
<i>green is for red,
red is for green.</i>

481
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,260
<i>- I don't think so.
- Try it then.</i>

482
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:26,981
<i>Hello!</i>

483
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,231
<i>You were right.</i>

484
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,184
<i>How the hell am I supposed
to know all of that?</i>

485
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,565
<i>Seems intuitive.</i>

486
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,021
<i>Can we get back
to saving our friend?</i>

487
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,491
<i>Get that jammer
ready to change the shield.</i>

488
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,945
<i>Guys?</i>

489
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,862
I mean, you wanna talk
about a sweet ride?

490
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,030
The acceleration
will crush your spine.

491
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,699
It's got that brand-new
fusalix core.

492
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,846
You know what I'm talking about?

493
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,870
Oh, yeah.

494
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,314
Really? 'Cause I just
made that up.

495
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,770
Oh, I thought
you said somethin' else.

496
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,787
Master Karja.

497
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,456
- No, you didn't.
- I... I did.

498
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,251
Master Karja, there appears
to be a physical breach

499
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,503
<i>in the white wing somewhere.</i>

500
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,083
- Could it be a glitch?
<i>- Maybe.</i>

501
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,008
I'm accessing the eye.

502
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,592
I'll see if I can locate it.

503
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:20,905
There's some sort of anomaly

504
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,115
<i>in the decompression chamber.
Best you check it out, Master.</i>

505
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,139
On it.

506
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,725
<i>Hui“! -</i>

507
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,697
Where do we put these?

508
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,241
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

509
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,491
Hurry!

510
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,301
What the hell was that, guys?

511
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,810
- What, are you kidding me?
- What?

512
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,313
A neutro-quark
just hit the satellite.

513
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,798
It's burning a hole
through the wall.

514
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,938
You geniuses,
you just throw the door open

515
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,319
without any proper
precautionary procedure?

516
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,775
What procedure, bro?

517
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,329
Oh! You want us to read
the manual for you too, bro?

518
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,618
You could have killed
everyone in the wing!

519
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,916
Exactly! You idiots!

520
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,417
I'm angry too!

521
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,665
On, no.

522
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,917
I mean, can't you see

523
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,714
these authentic
mechanic uniforms

524
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,080
that we're wearing
on our bodies?

525
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,785
That blend in with some of our
skin-tones better than others?

526
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,427
Excuse my friend.

527
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,672
He is the boss' nephew.
He's a little...

528
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,385
Oh. Oh.

529
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,181
Yeah. I...
I got one of those too.

530
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,062
I mean, this one?
This one I love.

531
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,234
I'm so proud.

532
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,857
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

533
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,780
But this one, I just...

534
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,572
Everything he does
drives me crazy.

535
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,666
Yeah.

536
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,811
I thought you said
something else.

537
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,835
Shut up.

538
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,689
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

539
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,940
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.

540
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,170
I am.

541
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,622
How'd you guys get here so fast?

542
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,458
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in

543
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,509
before it burned all the way
through, thankfully.

544
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,303
Ah. Good thing you were here.

545
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,923
All right, guys, wrap it up.

546
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,507
Looks like we're all clear here.

547
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,680
Our spacesuits!

548
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,353
You threw them
in the contamination bin.

549
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,189
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

550
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,991
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago.

551
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,069
Damn it, Mantis,
why don't you ever think?

552
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,321
Are we pretending
to be angry again?

553
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,655
Mantis, you asshole!

554
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,208
Guys, just focus
for two seconds.

555
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,654
We'll find another way
out of here.

556
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,750
Right now,
we need to save Rocket's life.

557
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,381
Nebula, Quinn, and I

558
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,379
will get to the records
and get the passkey.

559
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,470
Bug and Doofus,

560
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,171
access the spaceport
through the elevator

561
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,506
so Tree can land
and get us out of here.

562
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,182
Apologies.

563
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,269
No problem.

564
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,472
Go.

565
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,159
Not my fault
I don't know something

566
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,657
if no one ever tells me.

567
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,363
I didn't even wanna come here.

568
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,993
I'm gonna need to see your...

569
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,075
You're hopelessly in love

570
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,834
with him.

571
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,161
Oh, no.

572
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,167
Hey.

573
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,258
Hey.

574
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,677
How you doin' today?

575
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,010
I'm all right.

576
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,427
What was... What was
your name again?

577
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,097
- Drax the Destroyer.
- Oh.

578
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,516
That is such a lovely name.

579
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,813
Oh.

580
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,140
I'll get the door for you.

581
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,043
I'll be here when you
come back out, okay?

582
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,113
Sure.

583
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,522
Every single time.

584
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,321
My name is Bletelsnort.

585
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,825
<i>Welcome
to OrgoCorp headquarters.</i>

586
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,864
<i>For over 300 years,</i>

587
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,621
<i>OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants</i>

588
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,249
<i>and genetic upgrades
across the universe</i>

589
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,753
<i>under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.</i>

590
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,343
That warning we got today,

591
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,090
don't those two
match the description?

592
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,509
Attention, all Orgosentries,

593
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,139
That manager should
have access to the records.

594
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,852
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

595
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,274
All right.
I'll handle this one.

596
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,486
How?

597
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,857
Pure Star-Lord charm.

598
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,009
I'm excited for you
that you get to see this again

599
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,194
for the first time.

600
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,366
Hi, Yura.

601
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Ura.

602
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,084
- Oh. Ura.
- Hi.

603
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,208
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

604
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,965
I've been noticing you
for quite a while,

605
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,838
and the way
that you smile to yourself

606
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,920
when you think
nobody is looking,

607
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,051
it makes my every day
a bit brighter.

608
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,098
We need your hand.
And it's your choice

609
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,596
whether it's on your body
or not.

610
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,973
What are you doing?

611
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,645
She was never
gonna fall for that.

612
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,959
Dude, she was
totally into me, man!

613
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,503
I kind of thought
you were a douchebag.

614
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,023
- Oh, come on.
- We need a file.

615
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,318
- What file?
- 89P13.

616
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,691
- Could that be something?
- No.

617
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,317
Then your use to us

618
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,194
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

619
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,490
It sounds like a species tag.

620
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:38,787
Show us!

621
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,622
<i>All of our research supports</i>

622
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,668
<i>the High Evolutionary's
altruistic objective</i>

623
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,462
<i>of creating a utopian society.</i>

624
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,210
That must be the spaceport.

625
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,963
Whoa.

626
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,223
What is all this?

627
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,768
Species patented over
the years using OrgoCorp tech.

628
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,222
Every species
OrgoCorp has created

629
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,056
has its own individual file.

630
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,774
I'm so sorry about this.

631
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,898
Listen to me, this is not
the kind of thing we do.

632
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,150
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

633
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,730
Old you would have
never done this.

634
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,177
You had a purpose
higher than yourself.

635
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,429
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

636
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,180
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

637
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,694
Except, I didn't
form the Guardians.

638
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,996
- Sheesh.
- And I barely left Thanos.

639
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,666
Whoever it was
that you were in love with,

640
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
it wasn't me.

641
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,958
It sounds more like her.

642
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,049
- Her?
- What?

643
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,944
- That's ridiculous!
- Do not bring me into this.

644
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,584
Don't even...

645
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,555
- Knock it off!
- What?

646
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,053
Don't look at me
like a lost puppy

647
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,259
needing a soft place

648
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,873
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

649
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,767
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

650
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,856
They were replaced by my father

651
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,073
as a method of torture.

652
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,652
He... He picked a pretty set.

653
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,451
There.

654
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,080
That's the file for 89P13.

655
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,078
Heads up, heads up!

656
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,624
- Ugh.
- Okay.

657
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,722
What?

658
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,944
Oh, no.

659
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,407
Walk!

660
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,942
Move it, move it!

661
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,666
Stand down!

662
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,211
Drax, we should
make a run for it.

663
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,378
Or we could fight.

664
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,465
- Run.
- Fight.

665
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,086
- Run!
- Fight!

666
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,042
Take 'em!

667
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,593
What are we gonna do?

668
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,516
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

669
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,093
All of you, come with me...

670
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,980
Everybody, lower your weapons,

671
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,648
or I blow
this woman's brains out!

672
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,849
That's the plan?

673
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,936
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow.

674
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,069
You feel like dancing.

675
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,568
Violent rage.

676
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,825
Lower your weapons!

677
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,610
Let's kill that one
that looks like a carrot

678
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,920
to show we mean business.

679
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,627
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

680
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,680
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

681
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,427
We are not killing anyone!

682
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,518
Back off!

683
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,889
Groot, bring the <i>Bowie</i>
to us. Now.

684
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,614
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

685
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,785
Oh, please.

686
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:11,365
We're here to save the life
of our friend, that is all.

687
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,084
We paid her to help us get in
and get out.

688
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,690
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you

689
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,317
"do it in a way that
no one knows it's happening."

690
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,753
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

691
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,459
- "Threaten people's lives."
- Shut up!

692
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,615
And I know
you're probably asking,

693
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,129
why would I trust her?

694
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,056
Well, that's a good question.

695
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,509
The answer is,
we used to be in love.

696
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,686
Yeah. She was my girlfriend,

697
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,813
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

698
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,794
Because her dad threw her off
a magic cliff and she died,

699
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,899
and then I lost my temper

700
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,818
and nearly destroyed
half the universe.

701
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,737
Then she came back,
out of the past.

702
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,154
And there she is.

703
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,178
Everyone else who died in
the past stayed dead, not her.

704
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,443
Why? Was it the magic cliff?
I don't know.

705
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,949
I'm not some fricking
Infinity Stone scientist.

706
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,451
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love,

707
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,452
that girl died,

708
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,129
and then came back a total dick.

709
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,210
He left out
some important information,

710
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,845
but that is the gist of it.

711
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,637
Get to the security hub!

712
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,731
Okay!

713
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,362
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

714
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,113
Hey, hey, hey,
we don't want any...

715
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,782
No! Oh, my God

716
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:32,953
Oh, my God! No!

717
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,657
Come on! Would you please
stop doing that?

718
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:52,717
<i>Now, I'm craving your body
Is this real</i>

719
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,223
<i>Temperature's rising
I don't want to feel</i>

720
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,181
<i>I'm in the wrong place
To be real</i>

721
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,399
Yeah!

722
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,567
Hey!

723
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,773
<i>And I'm longing to love you
Just for a night</i>

724
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,794
Run.

725
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,571
Drax!

726
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,077
Get on the ground
and show me your hands now.

727
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,583
Ura?

728
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,551
Please listen to me.

729
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,845
We need to get out of here
with this

730
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,297
to save my best friend's life.

731
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,119
If you could get us
into the system

732
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,245
of those sentries out there,

733
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,182
they are good people,
like you. I'm certain of it.

734
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,552
And if I just had an opportunity

735
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,607
to speak to them...

736
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,273
They're corporate shills,
you idiot.

737
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,420
They're not gonna listen to you.

738
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,404
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

739
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,406
Ura.

740
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,449
Please.

741
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,200
Hey!

742
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,747
Come out now!

743
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,753
Damn it!

744
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,514
You are in.

745
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,019
Tell them your truth.

746
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,560
Yeah, I'm not that big
of an idiot.

747
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,103
I just needed to get
into the system.

748
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,981
Move it.

749
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,870
Told you she was into me.

750
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,225
I am Groot?

751
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,349
Yeah, that looked cool.

752
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,906
Is sky?

753
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,327
No.

754
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,075
That's not sky,
that's a ceiling.

755
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,034
But sire's making a new world
for all of us,

756
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,210
and when we get there,

757
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,166
there will be sky,

758
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,049
and it will be beautiful
and forever.

759
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,546
Wow.

760
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,423
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

761
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,923
I have been thinking.

762
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,684
'Bout what?

763
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,181
Oh, nothing in particular.

764
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,272
But I thought, since you guys
are my closest friends,

765
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,145
and my only friends,

766
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,943
you might
be interested in knowing

767
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,737
that I have been thinking.

768
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,363
That's cool.

769
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,866
I've been thinking, too,

770
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,570
about something more singular.

771
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,831
When sire moves us
to the new world,

772
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,828
we're gonna need names.

773
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,792
I mean,

774
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,836
89Q12,

775
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,334
it's not really a name,

776
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,836
so I would like my name to be...

777
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,179
Lylla.

778
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,094
Lylla.

779
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,966
Lylla.

780
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,392
Lylla.

781
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,641
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

782
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,098
Thank you.

783
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,569
I think my name shall be Teefs,

784
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,859
because, although
we all do have them,

785
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,109
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

786
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,120
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

787
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,412
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

788
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,335
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

789
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,505
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

790
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,334
Yes!

791
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,715
- Floor.
- Floor.

792
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,638
What about you, friend?

793
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,145
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly,

794
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,065
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together

795
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,645
into the forever
and beautiful sky.

796
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,526
Lylla, and Teefs,

797
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,783
and Floor, and me...

798
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,407
Rocket.

799
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,240
Rocket.

800
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,744
It really is good
to have friends.

801
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,753
Yeah.

802
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,627
<i>Stan' the incision here.</i>

803
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,764
<i>Keep calm.</i>

804
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,723
<i>- Hold it still.
- I can't!</i>

805
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,431
<i>It won't stop moving.</i>

806
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,817
Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

807
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,691
This is worse
than what Thanos did to me.

808
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,691
Well, what about
the passkey? ls it there?

809
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,410
No. But a file
was removed today.

810
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,501
Downloaded and deleted,

811
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,996
a million characters in length.

812
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:57,627
The biometrics say it was
this man. Recorder B2H6.

813
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,276
I saw this guy
outside of records today.

814
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,426
Hmm.

815
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,920
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

816
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,921
The High Evolutionary?

817
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,261
The founder of OrgoCorp?

818
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,263
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments

819
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,265
that lie outside
intergalactic laws.

820
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,393
He's created whole societies.

821
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,982
Xeronians, the Ani-Men,

822
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,480
- the Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

823
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,607
Corners of the universe
consider him God.

824
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,610
I am Groot.

825
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,701
Yes.

826
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,025
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

827
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,031
He said maybe this man
downloaded the passkey

828
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,453
into the computer on his head.

829
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
Huh?

830
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,207
That could store the passkey.

831
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,034
We find him, we save Rocket.

832
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,745
The High Evolutionary's
coordinates.

833
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,623
Put the coordinates in the nav.

834
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,718
Wait a minute.

835
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,925
Are you kidding me?

836
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,346
What he wants is that gutted
badger in the Med-Bay,

837
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,265
and you're gonna bring it
straight to him?

838
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,054
It's almost certainly a trap.

839
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,164
Trap isn't a trap
if you know the trap

840
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,708
is trying to trap you.
It's a face-off.

841
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,140
A face-off is a trap
if you're facing off

842
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,101
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

843
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,150
Do you know
who the High Evolutionary is?

844
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,528
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

845
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,484
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary

846
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,616
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

847
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,617
We won't think about it
when we do it.

848
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,619
You know what? I don't care!

849
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,979
Just drop me off
with the Ravagers,

850
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,960
and you go do whatever it is
that you wanna do.

851
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,252
We don't have time for this.

852
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,956
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now!

853
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,917
"Your people"? The Ravagers
aren't your people.

854
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,923
I'm a damn Ravager.
You aren't.

855
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,057
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

856
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,725
But my Gamora, the one I loved,

857
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,289
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals,

858
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,519
she found it with us.

859
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,768
People who care about you.

860
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,225
I know that's who you still are.

861
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,275
Somewhere inside of you...

862
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,115
What are you so afraid of
in your self

863
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,409
that I need to be
something for you?

864
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,616
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora.

865
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,118
Life made me me!

866
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:58,788
I have a few upgrades

867
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,745
courtesy of that gutted badger
in the Med-Bay,

868
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,170
and we are not risking his life

869
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,668
to make yours more convenient.

870
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:04,965
I'm family.

871
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,542
So is he.

872
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,256
Screw you.

873
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,553
Screw all of you.

874
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,696
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

875
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,901
pirating supply ships.

876
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,078
I do appreciate this, good sir.

877
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,247
And I appreciate
your generous contribution

878
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,325
to the Orgosentry
retirement fund.

879
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,659
Your associate,

880
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,964
a Zehoberi named Gamora,
where is she now?

881
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,319
You ain't getting
nothing from me.

882
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,835
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

883
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,091
Adam.

884
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,593
Adam.

885
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,765
Yes, Mother?

886
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,138
Show him we mean business.

887
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,037
I said show him
we mean business,

888
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,242
not disintegrate him!

889
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,939
What more business
could we have shown him?

890
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,499
But now he's of no use to us!

891
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,775
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

892
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,506
Friend?
You think that's a friend?

893
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,708
It's an animal!

894
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,507
He looks sad.

895
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,099
I really don't enjoy

896
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,583
how that's
making me feel, actually.

897
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,511
Your friend's a moron.

898
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,347
I got one of those too.
I get it.

899
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,523
<i>Outpost?
This is Gamora, you there?</i>

900
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,405
<i>Fitz-Gibbonok.</i>

901
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,489
Come in.

902
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,320
<i>Outpost, come in.</i>

903
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,948
Yes, Gamora.

904
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,995
Salutations.

905
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,416
<i>May I help?</i>

906
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,024
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

907
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,459
<i>I'm gonna upload
the location-link</i>

908
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,835
<i>to the craft I'm on.</i>

909
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,421
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

910
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,566
<i>Do you realize</i>

911
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:42,616
<i>That you have the most</i>

912
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,957
<i>Beautiful face?</i>

913
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:51,336
<i>Do you realize</i>

914
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,683
<i>We're floating in space?</i>

915
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:06,264
<i>Do you realize</i>

916
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,269
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

917
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,153
Why don't you just say it?

918
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,481
No one ever listens to me.

919
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:21,037
<i>Do you realize</i>

920
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,042
<i>That everyone...</i>

921
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:31,549
Quill,

922
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:33,882
life is a pond,

923
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,419
and you've spent
your entire life

924
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,129
leaping from woman to woman

925
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,510
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

926
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,509
Perhaps, what you need
to do, Quill,

927
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,520
is learn to swim.

928
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,564
- That actually made sense.
- Yes, it made sense.

929
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,861
No, I mean,
that's sort of an analogy.

930
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,884
And I didn't know
that you were capable

931
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,819
of that type of thought.

932
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,526
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

933
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,195
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

934
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,451
For instance,

935
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,252
Gamora's head is like a
lily pad because it is green.

936
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,913
Analogy-

937
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,089
And also stupid-looking

938
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,508
- and flappy.
- Flappy'?

939
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,053
Because her skin
is made of a leaf.

940
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,629
Metaphor.

941
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,051
Is it?

942
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,305
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

943
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,263
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

944
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,234
Oh.

945
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,409
What's happening?

946
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,822
The fluid is in his lungs.

947
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,783
P13?

948
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,203
P13.

949
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,076
Sire.

950
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,461
P13!

951
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,255
My lord,
might I suggest that we...

952
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,676
Must...

953
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,339
Ooh. Ooh.

954
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,989
Sire was in
the middle of his treatments

955
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,510
when we had a breakthrough
with Batch 92.

956
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,386
Perhaps then we should
resume tomorrow, yes?

957
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,468
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

958
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,893
P13!

959
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,437
Oh. Ooh.

960
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,192
There you are.

961
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,245
Hello.

962
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,330
How did you know

963
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,418
about the microseminoproteins,
P13?

964
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,194
What happened in there?

965
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,122
Why?

966
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,449
How did you know, P13?

967
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,534
Uh, it was
too little filtration...

968
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,245
In the hypotonic, yes,
we know, we fixed that.

969
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,955
But how did you know?

970
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,007
I made you!

971
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,335
How did you know?

972
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,632
Because it worked.

973
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,065
It... It worked.

974
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,896
Their rage is gone.

975
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,529
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought,

976
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,281
ready to inhabit the new world.

977
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,869
We're going to the new world?

978
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,710
Oh.

979
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,452
We?

980
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,247
Look at you.

981
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,795
As if you were

982
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,593
cobbled together
by fat-fingered children.

983
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,592
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

984
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:11,805
You're simply a medley of
mistakes we could learn from

985
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,603
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

986
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:21,144
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

987
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,105
You could figure out
the complex workings

988
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,691
of cytoplasmic
filtration systems,

989
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,742
but you couldn't
figure out that?

990
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,288
But that brain.

991
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,667
That, I'd like to study further.

992
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,505
Prep it for surgery
and removal in the morning.

993
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,465
What about the rest
of Batch 89, sire?

994
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,641
Incinerate them.

995
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,065
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

996
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,271
We don't have long.

997
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,073
<i>We've arrived.</i>

998
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,042
<i>We care a lot</i>

999
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,707
That looks just like...

1000
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,970
home.

1001
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,301
<i>We care a lot</i>

1002
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,855
<i>About disasters, fires
Floods and killer bees</i>

1003
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,394
It's like a replica of Earth.

1004
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,858
It makes no sense.

1005
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,983
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

1006
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,273
<i>We care a lot</i>

1007
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,531
<i>About disease, baby, rock
Hudson, rock, yeah!</i>

1008
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:04,334
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
Bu! someone is gotta do it</i>

1009
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,588
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
Bu! someone is gotta do it</i>

1010
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,138

01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,189

1013
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,493
<i>About the gamblers
And the pushers and the geeks</i>

1014
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,614
<i>We care a lot</i>

1015
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,039
<i>About the smack and crack
And whack that hits the streets</i>

1016
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,702
Hello.

1017
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,161
We mean you no harm.

1018
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,701
Listen to me, he was just trying

1019
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,965
to throw her back her ball.

1020
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,017
- Ow!

1021
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,686
- Hey!
- Ow, ow.

1022
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,855
Come on! There's no reason...

1023
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,399
Hey, hey.

1024
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,318
Groot, full Kaiju!

1025
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,817
- Not full Kaiju!
- I am

1026
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,277
- Groot!
- Back up.

1027
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,732
No, not Kaiju!

1028
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,158
Groot, down!

1029
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,781
There's no reason to be afraid.

1030
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,830
Get down, Groot!

1031
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:22,957
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

1032
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,159
Hey. Hey, hi.

1033
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,836
We're not here to harm you.

1034
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,840
Okay.

1035
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,798
See? Here.

1036
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,167
<i>For your knee.</i>

1037
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,172
We just need to save our friend.

1038
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,179
Filthy.
It doesn't belong here.

1039
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,065
I will train it in the ways
of the Sovereign.

1040
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,441
I will train him not to do that.

1041
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,818
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

1042
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,275
Kill it. Now.

1043
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,281
I am the Warlock, Mum,

1044
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,829
and I am done
with being ordered around.

1045
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,365
Gamora is here.

1046
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,251
Which means
the squirrel is also.

1047
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,338
To save ourselves,

1048
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,733
we must bring it
to the High Evolutionary

1049
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,714
before his own people do.

1050
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,107
Yeah, yeah, sit.

1051
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,863
Let's sit. Okay.

1052
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:49,794
I am Groot.

1053
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,747
It's not rude.
It's what it's here for.

1054
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,252
Drax, sit up!

1055
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,343
Idiot.

1056
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,460
Thank you.

1057
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,011
Thank you.

1058
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,557
Our friend...

1059
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,222
He's dying.

1060
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:10,648
Uh...

1061
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:18,319
We love our friend.

1062
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,239
But he is dying.

1063
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,494
That's not dying,
that's already dead.

1064
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,040
They'll think he's already dead.

1065
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,118
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

1066
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,954
Drax, sit up.

1067
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,129
That's what it's here for!

1068
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,377
Drax, it isn't.

1069
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,153
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder

1070
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,177
right next to each other.

1071
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,322
Get your boots off her pillows.

1072
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,461
I find it hard to believe

1073
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,876
it doesn't have
multiple purposes!

1074
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,557
I'm sorry.
My friend is a dumbass.

1075
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,305
That's the same as your dying.

1076
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,103
Why do you criticize everything?

1077
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,520
Well, why is it oblong then?

1078
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,972
It was
a totally different sound.

1079
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,399
No, it wasn't. Dying.
Dumbass.

1080
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,318
- See? It's the same.
- All right, guys!

1081
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,987
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

1082
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,530
Drax, I see you!

1083
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,571
I understand that none of this

1084
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,245
makes any sense
to you right now.

1085
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,910
We need your help

1086
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,659
in finding a man.

1087
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,960
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna draw.

1088
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,254
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

1089
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,674
Like this.

1090
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,878
You see the thing on her head?

1091
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,507
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful. Mm.

1092
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,057
There you go.

1093
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,306
Have you seen this man?

1094
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,555
That's very good.

1095
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,770
Can I have that later to hang
in my apartment, please?

1096
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,602
Yeah. Thank you.

1097

His name is "Mowtio"?</i>

- Oh.

1102
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,881
- There?
- Oh.

1103
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,427
- At the pyramid.
- Oh.

1104
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,805
Is that your car
in the driveway?

1105
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,678
- Oh.
- Eo.

1106
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,771
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

1107
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,213
Watch him.
That's who they're coming for.

1108
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,477
- I wanna come.
- No.

1109
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,608
Mantis, watch Drax.

1110
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,861
Groot, you know
what to do with these.

1111
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,370
- Push down on it.
- What?

1112
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,577
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

1113
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,037
Push the button.

1114
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,151
It looks like
you're pushing the keyhole.

1115
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,415
- The what?
- There's a button

1116
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,968
under the handle, press that in.

1117
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,005
Okay. Now what?

1118
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,555
Open the fucking door.

1119
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,722
That is a stupid design,

1120
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:54,646
and your instructions
were very unclear.

1121
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,515
Let's get that passkey
and save our friend.

1122
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,636
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

1123
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,660
Why would I know any more

1124
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,097
about driving one of
these things than you do?

1125
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,932
- Don't see you volunteering.
- You want me to drive?

1126
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:10,956
- No.
<i>- I'll</i> drive.

1127
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,747
I don't want you to drive.
I got this.

1128
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,526
<i>Just a wild goose chase</i>

1129

Have all been denied</i>

1130

<i>Why have I always Been a failure</i>

1131
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,750
<i>What can the reason be</i>

1132
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,169
You must be a really loyal pet

1133
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,749
if they're willing to do
all this for you.

01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:37,074
<i>My schemes are just like
All my dreams</i>

1137
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:45,504
<i>Ending in the sky</i>

1138
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,887
<i>Some fellows look
And find the sunshine</i>

1139
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,841
<i>I always look And find the rain</i>

1140
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,013
<i>Ana' some fellows
Make a winning sometime</i>

1141
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:10,324
<i>I'm always chasing rainbows</i>

1142
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,861
This is the perfect society?

1143
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,601
Sire.

1144
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,893
This one has been running
for two hours

1145
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,470
without breaking a sweat.

1146
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,272
- It's incredible...
- They can survive

1147
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,644
on 30 calories a day,

1148
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,647
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy,

1149
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,819
and they can rewire
a carbenetrix core

1150
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,817
in under two minutes.

1151
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,904
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

1152
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,486
Sire, they're here.

1153
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,244
Here we go.

1154
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,386
We're hereto see...

1155
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,055
The High Evolutionary
is expecting you.

1156
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,303
Which means it is a trap.

1157
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,508
It's a face-off.

1158
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,093
She stays here.

1159
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,178
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry,

1160
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:23,684
and your arm is a gun.

1161
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,486
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

1162
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,115
Hey.

1163
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,691
It'll be okay.

1164
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,925
Move it!

1165
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,525
Are you okay, Rocket?

1166
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,177
Me Rocket play now?

1167
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:38,299
I can't right now, Floor.

1168
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,104
What are you doing?

1169
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,807
They ain't gonna set us free.

1170
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,896
Yes, they are, Rocket.

1171
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,944
We're going to the new world
any day now.

1172
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:57,899
No, that can't be true.

1173
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:58,994
It is.

1174
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,573
They wanna kill us all
in the morning.

1175
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,200
- What?
- What?

1176
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,372
But I'm gonna fix it.

1177
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,421
What is that?

1178
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,919
It's a key.

1179
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,793
I'm gonna use it
to get us all out of here.

1180
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,887
I don't know
if that's wise, Rocket.

1181
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,215
- Mm.
- Me Rocket leave!

1182
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,676
Hooray time forever!

1183
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,350
Just down that hall,
there are ships.

1184
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,641
I know.
And if we can get to one,

1185
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,101
I can pilot it.

1186
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,821
And then we'll all fly away
together, the four of us,

1187
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,232
just like we always said, okay?

1188
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,079
Okay?

1189
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,119
Whoo-hoo! Yippee!
Rocket! Sky, sky, Sky!

1190
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,860
- You did it!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1191
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:16,981
You did it!

1192
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,859
You did it, you did it,
you did it!

1193
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,096
You did it!

1194
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,387
You did it.

1195
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,515
It really is good to have...

1196
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,779
Yes, I imagined
you'd do something like this.

1197
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,451
Back in the cage, P13.

1198
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,000
Sky.

1199
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,812
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1200
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,559
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1201
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,516
Q12 and P13

1202
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,630
- escaped from their pens.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1203
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,549
- Q12 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1204
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,676
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- But P13 is still out,

1205
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,940
- so I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1206
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,823
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1207
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,950
Remember not to bruise
its brain.

1208
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,202
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1209
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,658
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1210
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,289
All right, P13!

1211
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,296
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1212
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,047
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- Rocket, let's go!

1213
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,133
Let's go! Rocket, please!

1214
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,723
Rocket! Rocket!

1215
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,723
Down here. Hurry.

1216
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,994
- Hey, there it is!
- Get him!

1217
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,746
- Get back here!
- Get it!

1218
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:18,997
He's getting away!

1219
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,590
What are you doing?

1220
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,165
I got a bad feeling about this.

1221
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,126
Peter just told you
to stay here.

1222
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,380
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1223
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,886
He should know by now
that I never do

1224
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,680
anything that anyone
ever tells me.

1225
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,507
We need to protect Rocket.

1226
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,133
Yeah, that's right.

1227
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,520
So, hop on and we'll ride
back to the ship.

1228
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,267
Just right over there?

1229
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,900
Yeah.

1230
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,412
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1231
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,549
You!

1232
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,332
Hey, yeah, you!

1233
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,047
I take it the passkey,

1234
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,418
it's in that thing on your head.

1235
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,847
I would advise
against aggression.

1236
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,554
Oh. Got time for me now?

1237
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,225
Your friend once took advantage.

1238
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,146
I learn my lessons.

1239
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:07,310
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity

1240
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,190
back in my own direction,

1241
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,364
and now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

1242
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,943
War Pig.

1243
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,152
<i>Now.</i>

1244
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,832
You must find
Counter-Earth familiar.

1245
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,000
Counter-Earth?

1246
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:25,203
I visited your planet
many years ago.

1247
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,038
Earth hasn't been my planet
in a long time.

1248
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,247
Your people had

1249
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,966
- wonderful spirit.
- Mm.

1250
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,839
The art and music and literature

1251
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,171
were some of the finest
in the universe.

1252
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,258
Earth would be a fabulous place,

1253
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,684
were it not for
the ignorance and bigotry.

1254
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,853
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create

1255
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,522
- Counter-Earth.
- I don't care.

1256
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,190
All of the good
and none of the bad.

1257
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:49,314
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

1258
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,736
whose mother didn't love him

1259
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,315
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1260
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,242
I'm not trying
to conquer the universe.

1261
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,993
I'm perfecting it.

1262
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,497
What the...

1263
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:25,857
Hey!

1264
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,811
Drop the badger.

1265
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,986
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1266
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,441
I am Groot.

1267
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,944
He says, "Suck my..."

1268
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,244
Why are you so angry?

1269
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,198
Because I know
what you did to our friend.

1270
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,957
Anything I've done,

1271
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,125
I've done for the betterment
of the universe.

1272
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,623
Newsflash, Einstein.

1273
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,191
Better universes
generally don't include

1274
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,797
a bunch of octopuses
selling meth

1275
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,625
to guys with cockroach heads.

1276
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,012
They do not.

1277
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,474
Which is why,

1278
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,845
as I have done
many times before,

1279
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,143
I'm going to have to raze it all

1280
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,928
and start again.

1281
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,138
What?

1282
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,569
I got 89P13,

1283
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,241
<i>and I'm on my way.</i>

1284
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,688
We're in possession
of the subject.

1285
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,415
Ow!

1286
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,642
Oh, my God.

1287
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,441
I am Groot?

1288
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,617
Kill 'em all.

1289
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,534
Stay.

1290
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,120
Uh-uh. I said "stay."

1291
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,940
What, did you want me
to leave you back,

1292
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,329
so that Mother could fillet you?

1293
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,505
Stay.

1294
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:16,592
What the hell?

1295
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,918
We're working for the same boss.

1296
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,094
Yes, but I need
the credit, chum,

1297
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,172
to save my entire civilization.

1298
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,305
So be a good creepy... thing

1299
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,978
and back off.

1300
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:38,899
No.

1301
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,604
Mother.

1302
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,513
Mother!

1303
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,932
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1304
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,105
Mantis? Drax?

1305
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,853
Uh, <i>hey.</i>

1306
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,184
I need you to bring
the ship here now!

1307
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,862
<i>Well, we can't
do that exactly because...</i>

1308
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,658
<i>we're not at the ship.</i>

1309
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,903
Then where the hell are...

1310
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:34,647
Nebula, come in.

1311
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:36,684
Gamora! Take off now!

1312
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,937
Get yourself and Rocket
off the planet.

1313
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,647
What kinda ship is this?

1314
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:50,570
It's amusing, really.

1315
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,120
How stupid are you, hmm?

1316
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,914
It was so obviously a trap.

1317
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,951
It's not a trap.
It's a face-off.

1318
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,207
Now kill them all.

1319
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:01,832
What do you have in your hand?

1320
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,007
Grenade!

1321
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:48,427
I am Groot!

1322
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,539
No! Don't!

1323
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,998
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1324
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,923
Please, spare me, please.

1325
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,381
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1326
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,508
- That'd be premature.
- Huh?

1327
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,426
No, no, no...

1328
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,192
Quite a novel escape plan,

1329
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,741
jumping headfirst
into an exploding planet.

1330
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,494
You'll kill us both!

1331
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,040
Not both.

1332
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,266
Why are we doing this?

1333
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,514
Quill and Groot are inside.

1334
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,311
We have to get them out.

1335
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,218
Groot.

1336
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,484
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1337
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,403
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1338
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,105
Well, pull harder!

1339
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,032
Let's go. Come on.

1340
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:42,050
It's hard to breathe.

1341
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,894
We are entering space.

1342
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:17,969
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1343
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:19,629
Oh, piss off.

1344
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,483
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1345
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,149
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I don't know!

1346
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:39,612
- Gimme.
- Here.

1347
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,032
Ha! You're lucky I was able

1348
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,642
- to knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora

1349
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,498
are probably dead
because of you!

1350
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,454
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1351
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,411
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse

1352
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,247
of being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing,

1353
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,457
and the rest of us having
to carry your slack!

1354
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:56,883
Don't push him!

1355
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,322
You don't have the right
to push him.

1356
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,132
And you! You're no better.

1357
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,009
The only thing
we can count on you for

1358
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,431
is when someone shows weakness,

1359
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,974
you'll be right there
to support it.

1360
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,472
Fine, I don't care.

1361
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,770
I know you need to find fault
in everyone else

1362
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,439
to make yourself feel okay,

1363
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:13,062
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1364
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,939
But you don't have the right
to push him!

1365
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:17,609
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1366
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,781
- He's a liability.
- He makes us laugh

1367
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,735
and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1368
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,620
All you care about
is intelligence and...

1369
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,993
and competence.

1370
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,120
Not sure I appreciate
this defense.

1371
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,541
He has sadness,

1372
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:33,461
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1373
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,831
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1374
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,087
You think I'm stupid?

1375
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:40,465
Yes.

1376
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,059
Forget.

1377
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,849
Ha! You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door

1378
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,429
with my incredible strength.

1379
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:53,690
Quill?

1380
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,688
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1381
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,567
Joob joob...

1382
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,233
That language
isn't in my translator.

1383
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,041
Okay. Here we go.

1384
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:37,897
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1385
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:39,738
Go.

1386
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:59,585
Lylla?

1387
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:02,380
Friend.

1388
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,047
Okay, okay.

1389
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:08,142
Okay, here we go.

1390
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:12,980
This isn't right.

1391
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:16,315
No, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1392
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,607
It needs to be faster.

1393
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:23,151
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1394
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,153
Rocket.

1395
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:27,575
I let you down.

1396
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:29,910
I got you killed.

1397
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,080
I got everybody killed.

1398
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,949
We were right.

1399
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:38,250
The sky is beautiful,
and it is forever.

1400
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,673
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1401
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,351
Can I come?

1402
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,106
Yes.

1403
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:08,702
No, no, no!

1404
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,162
No!

1405
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,361
Come on.

1406
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,621
- Come on!
- Quill.

1407
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,034
No!

1408
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,416
No!

1409
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,669
- Quill.
- No!

1410
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,050
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.

1411
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,252
He's gone.

1412
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,009
I'm not letting him go!

1413
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:33,435
Come on.

1414
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:47,522
But not yet.

1415
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,446
You still have a purpose here.

1416
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,994
A purpose for what?

1417
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,034
They made us for nothing.

1418
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,707
Stupid experiments
to be thrown away.

1419
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,915
There are the hands
that made us,

1420
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,963
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1421
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,430
Mm.

1422
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,344
My beloved raccoon.

1423
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,468
This story
has been yours all along,

1424
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:17,893
you just didn't know it.

1425
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,063
I'm not a raccoon.

1426
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,192
The passkey's going through!

1427
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:50,804
Quill?

1428
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,564
Where's Nebula?

1429
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,030
Sh... She's, uh...

1430
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,250
Because her code
is on the comm behind you.

1431
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,048
What? Nebula?

1432
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:31,046
- Where are you?
- Oh, thank God!

1433
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,468
We're here
to get you out of here.

1434
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:34,199
<i>- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship.</i>

1435
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:35,759
No, I got off the ship.

1436
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,215
- You what'?
<i>- Wait, where are you?</i>

1437
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,391
On the ship!

1438
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,889
- On the ship?
<i>- I</i> didn't/la.

1439
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:41,310
Why are you on the ship?

1440
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:42,637
To save you, obviously.

1441
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:43,847
<i>No, I told you to go back.</i>

1442
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,541
You gotta know by now
I always figure out

1443
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,442
an incredibly clever way
to get out of a fix.

1444
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:49,314
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1445
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,066
Tell him we're coming
to save him.

1446
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,898
Pay attention
or play with the kids.

1447
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,198
<i>One or the other.</i>

1448
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,366
"Play with the kids"?

1449
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,907
- How did you get out?
- That's not really important.

1450
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,328
I am Groot.

1451
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,873
Jumping a thousand feet to
your death without a parachute

1452
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:02,994
is a clever way

1453
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,918
<i>- of getting out of a fix?</i>

1454
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,204
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1455
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:08,497
The important thing is

1456
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:10,127
<i>we're all okay.</i>

1457
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:14,388
Rocket?

1458
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:16,963
Yeah, he's here.

1459
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,139
And he's okay.

1460
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,525
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1461
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:30,609
Well, that makes you
the idiots then.

1462
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:31,902
<i>He is right about that.</i>

1463
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,486
Back in your cages!

1464
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:40,872
Nebula?

1465
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,490
Nebula, come in!

1466
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,923
So, you'd like to joust,
would you?

1467
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,510
Go to hell,
you sick son of a bitch.

1468
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,133
<i>You killed all of those people.</i>

1469
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,056
As I will your friends.

1470
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,759
<i>I'm sending you the coordinates.</i>

1471
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,437
They will die
unless you bring me

1472
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:06,604
<i>what is mine!</i>

1473
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,685
Screw you, you stretch-faced,
RoboCop-looking,

1474
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,234
Skeletor wannabe,

1475
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,312
purple-nurple piece of...

1476
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:18,574
He hung up.

1477
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:22,495
You think?

1478
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,409
1966.

1479
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:30,086
The Soviet put me on a rocket,

1480
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:33,256
knowing full well I'm never
to return and I will die

1481
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:35,174
in a fiery ball of death.

1482
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,420
But one thing
even <i>mudak</i> Soviets never do

1483
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,755
is call me bad dog.

1484
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,262
Oh, my God!
Could you just let it go?

1485
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:45,969
Kraglin, please,
just take it back.

1486
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,394
This is killing us.

1487
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,315
I can't take it back
if she is, in fact,

1488
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:52,434
a bad dog.

1489
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:53,528
Kraglin!

1490
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,695
Oh, it never stops hurting.

1491
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:56,987
<i>Kraglin.</i>

1492
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:58,819
Oh, hey, Pete.

1493
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,651
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,

1494
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,611
and we need your help.

1495
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:03,820
Me?

1496
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,159
You're the one who lost it,
you twit.

1497
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:11,369
The Hellspawn had it,
sire, but...

1498
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,831
But, but, but! But!

1499
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,501
That rancid word.

1500
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,847
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser

1501
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,390
to go directly to the new colony

1502
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,434
and not engage
in unnecessary conflict.

1503
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:30,310
They can rewire a carbenetrix
core in under two minutes,

1504
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:31,685
but what is that, Vim?

1505
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,610
Rote memorization.

1506
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,435
Rote memorization!

1507
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:38,316
In hundreds of years
of our creations,

1508
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:41,570
only one has known
true invention.

1509
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:42,661
One.

1510
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:49,370
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1511
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,290
Yes, sire.

1512
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:58,542
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought

1513
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:00,252
will die on the vine.

1514
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:03,714
We need 89P13's brain,

1515
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,301
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures

1516
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:09,386
before we go to the new colony.

1517
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,517
Nothing else matters.

1518
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,042
How did they get down here?

1519
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,335
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1520
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:38,248
Peter will be trying
to get to the spaceport.

1521
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:40,374
He doesn't know
about the children.

1522
01:41:40,886 --> 01:41:42,172
You!

1523
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,722
We need you to let all the
other children on board know

1524
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:47,424
to stay away
from the starboard walls.

1525
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:50,267
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1526
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:51,498
They know three frickin' words

1527
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:52,933
and two of them are 70012. <i>"</i>

1528
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:56,149
- Joob joob.
- No! Listen to me!

1529
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,228
You need to talk
to the other children,

1530
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:01,984
all of them here, and tell them

1531
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,065
to stay away
from the freaking...

1532
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,776
What the hell
are you doing, Mantis?

1533
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,453
Explaining it, dickhead!

1534
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,541
<i>Joob joob eo!</i>

1535
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:18,167
<i>Joob joob eo!</i>

1536
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:20,878
You're scaring them.

1537
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:28,297
Hello, dumb idiots.

1538
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:34,186
I had a little girl like you.

1539
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,606
You know what she used to like?

1540
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,017
She liked when
I made monkey noises.

1541
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,695
Beep.

1542
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:45,319
Beep, beep. Beep-

1543
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:51,036
How is that a monkey?

1544
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,198
Beats me.

1545
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,671
Boop.

1546
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,846
Boop.

1547
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,140
Boop.

1548
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:28,149
<i>Eo, eo. Joob joob.</i>

1549
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,530
- Joob joob.
- Yeah.

1550
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,031
Joob joob.

1551
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,157
<i>Yeah. Joob joob.</i>

1552
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,660
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1553
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,894
They're gonna tell
the other kids

1554
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:37,187
to stay away
from the starboard wall.

1555
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,211
Why didn't you tell us

1556
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:40,081
you knew their language
this whole time?

1557
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:41,920
Why didn't you ask?

1558
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,927
This could be futile,
Quill. He's too powerful.

1559
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,845
Well, then I guess
we'll die trying.

1560
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:52,515
What is "dying trying"
gonna accomplish?

1561
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,183
Or we can just give him
the badger?

1562
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,762
Our thing is dying trying.

1563
01:43:56,856 --> 01:43:57,937
I am Groot.

1564
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,726
I know who you are already!

1565
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,524
Feel free to stay behind
in the cargo area.

1566
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:05,569
I'm not leaving my sister
with that jackass.

1567
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:06,942
This you?

1568
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:08,648
Fell out of your bag.

1569
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:11,989
Let's do this.

1570
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,764
<i>Well, you didn't wake up
This morning</i>

1571
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:42,474
<i>'Cause you didn't go to bed</i>

1572
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,777
<i>You were watching the whites
Of your eyes turn red</i>

1573
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,863
<i>The calendar on your wall</i>

1574
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,280
Wait.

1575
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,077
Wait.

1576
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:55,904
<i>Reading some old letters</i>

1577
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:56,998
<i>You smile...</i>

1578
01:44:57,875 --> 01:45:01,413
You almost
have to admire their pluck.

1579
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:03,541
Sire.

1580
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:12,587
<i>Across the clear blue sky</i>

1581
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,508
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1582
01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:19,560
<i>Your life will surely change</i>

1583
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,889
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1584
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,065
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1585
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,692
You're on, Steemie.

1586
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:28,488
First barrel.

1587
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,529
<i>This is the day
Your life will surely change</i>

1588
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:31,822
Second barrel.

1589
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,238
Third barrel.

1590
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,443
Fourth barrel.

1591
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,491
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1592
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:44,001
<i>This is the day</i>

01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:45,704
Hard starboard.

1594

<i>This is the day</i>

01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,595

01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:56,047
<i>This is the day</i>

1599
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,351
They've breached the spaceport.

1600
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:06,933
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1601
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:08,688
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1602
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,440
Sire, the Hellspawn were created

1603
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:11,716
solely to defend the new colony

1604
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,151
Do it now!

1605
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:14,903
Get me 89P13,

1606
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:18,237
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1607
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:58,200
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n,

<i>but that old missile's
all we had.</i>

1609
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:03,456
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1610
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,470
What the hell?

1611
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:34,938
Aw, come on!

01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,928
Kraglin,

1613
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:10,564
Open the pit.

1614
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:13,268
Sire, our bargaining power
will be gone.

1615

Abilisks!

1616
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,435
Good God!

1617
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:56,068
This way!

1618
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:04,049
One more step
and this weird thing gets it!

1619
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:05,755
Don't be rash.

1620
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,441
What were you programming?

1621
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,822
A self-destruction code.

1622
01:50:44,847 --> 01:50:46,053
What are you doing?

1623
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:50,432
It's okay.

1624
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:51,680
Mantis, stop!

1625
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,179
They eat batteries,

1626
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,601
not people.

1627
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:01,569
Maybe they're just scared of
what we are gonna do to them.

1628
01:51:08,453 --> 01:51:10,114
We're not gonna hurt you.

1629
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:15,199
Everything is going to be okay.

1630
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:12,180
Use your heart, boy.

1631
01:53:03,318 --> 01:53:04,683
A dog!

1632
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:05,939
Yeah.

1633
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:16,328
She's a good dog.

1634
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:22,959
I knew you believe
I am good dog.

1635
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:24,878
All right, all right,
get off me, you idiot!

1636
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:31,464
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1637
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,262
The spaceport has intruders.

1638
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:36,299
Go! See if one of them
is 89P13.

1639
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:38,579
Sire, you have an irrational
obsession with this animal.

1640
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:40,014
You must stop, for God's sake!

1641
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:41,812
There is no God!

1642
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:44,147
That's why I stepped in!

1643
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:17,136
Controller, I am taking
command of the Arête.

1644
01:54:17,225 --> 01:54:21,640
Disengage all damaged sectors
of the ship,

1645
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:24,184
and retreat.

1646
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:50,213

Nebula, and Drax.

1655
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,908
We move in, we get 'em,

1657
01:55:41,726 --> 01:55:43,091
Did that look cool?

1658
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:45,553
Okay, new game plan.

1659
01:55:45,647 --> 01:55:47,558
We get the hell out of here now.

1660
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:49,409
There are thousands
of creatures on the ship.

1661
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:50,690
Many of them are children.

1664
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:58,319
If we wanna live,
we have to leave now.

1665
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,201
This whole rig is gonna
go down any second.

1666

1780
02:07:12,959 --> 02:07:14,449
For what?

1781
02:07:14,544 --> 02:07:16,626
All I wanted to do

1782
02:07:17,088 --> 02:07:18,749
was to make things

1783
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:20,504
perfect.

1784
02:07:21,384 --> 02:07:23,591
You didn't wanna
make things perfect.

1785
02:07:23,678 --> 02:07:26,045
You just hated things
the way they are.

1786
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:27,553
Kill him.

1787
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,230
Why?

1788
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:38,981
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1789
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:42,606
We have to get outta here now.

1790
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:43,732
We have to save them.

1791
02:07:43,823 --> 02:07:44,967
We've got all the kids on board.

1792
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:45,991
No, Pete.

1793
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:48,400
The rest of them.

1794
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:56,324
Come on!
Come on. Whoa!

1795
02:07:56,836 --> 02:07:57,917
Move!

1796
02:07:58,004 --> 02:07:59,460
Move it, bird!

1797
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,246
- Whoa!
- Come on!

1798
02:08:04,802 --> 02:08:05,802
Come on!

1799
02:08:05,887 --> 02:08:07,469
Come on, come on, come on!

1800
02:08:10,933 --> 02:08:12,202
Thought we were
limiting ourselves

1801
02:08:12,226 --> 02:08:13,226
to the higher life forms?

1802
02:08:13,311 --> 02:08:15,177
Yeah, well, me too.

1803
02:08:15,271 --> 02:08:17,512
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1804
02:08:23,529 --> 02:08:24,644
Go, babies.

1805
02:08:24,739 --> 02:08:25,979
Go, babies.

1806
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:27,609
Go!

1807
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:30,362
I cannot hold much...

1808
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:37,709
Run!

1809
02:08:37,793 --> 02:08:38,908
GO! Go!

1810
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:52,593
Quill! Hurry!

1811
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:38,723
Peter!

1812
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:46,415
Peter!

1813
02:10:52,428 --> 02:10:53,918
Did that

1814
02:10:54,013 --> 02:10:55,469
look

1815
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,468
cool?

1816
02:11:00,644 --> 02:11:01,644
Come on.

1817
02:11:13,741 --> 02:11:16,824
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1818
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:56,154
I am Groot.

1819
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:59,193
Thanks. Just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1820
02:12:04,834 --> 02:12:06,199
I am Groot.

1821
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:10,795
Yeah. It was good
working with you, too.

1822
02:12:18,597 --> 02:12:21,089
Hey, Gamora.
Are you ready?

1823
02:12:21,767 --> 02:12:22,882
Yeah.

1824
02:12:29,108 --> 02:12:30,908
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1825
02:12:32,736 --> 02:12:33,736
I know.

1826
02:12:35,114 --> 02:12:37,230
But who you are ain't so bad.

1827
02:12:57,178 --> 02:12:58,885
I bet we were fun.

1828
02:13:04,143 --> 02:13:05,884
Like you wouldn't believe.

1829
02:13:12,443 --> 02:13:13,478
Okay.

1830
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:28,827
You Okay?

1831
02:13:30,753 --> 02:13:32,915
I think I need to talk
to everybody.

1832
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:37,214
So, you're gonna leave?

1833
02:13:38,886 --> 02:13:40,947
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old,

1834
02:13:40,971 --> 02:13:43,133
and I have been running
ever since.

1835
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:46,341
I'm gonna need
to take some time...

1836
02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:50,144
and learn how to swim.

1837
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:53,775
I as well.

1838
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:01,231
I love you all. I do.

1839
02:14:05,412 --> 02:14:08,530
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted,

1840
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:11,871
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1841
02:14:12,628 --> 02:14:15,962
I need to go out
and discover what I want.

1842
02:14:16,048 --> 02:14:18,164
<i>- I'll</i> come with you.
- No, Drax.

1843
02:14:18,259 --> 02:14:19,499
That's the whole point.

1844
02:14:19,593 --> 02:14:21,129
But you need someone
to protect you.

1845
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,302
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1846
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:24,908
Just because of
your incredible weakness.

1847
02:14:24,932 --> 02:14:26,422
Oh, my gosh,
you're so frustrating!

1848
02:14:26,517 --> 02:14:27,632
Drax.

1849
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,471
I need you here.

1850
02:14:30,312 --> 02:14:31,768
We're building a new society.

1851
02:14:32,439 --> 02:14:33,895
I need all the support I can get

1852
02:14:33,983 --> 02:14:35,143
for those children out there.

1853
02:14:36,277 --> 02:14:38,860
Today, I saw who you are.

1854
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:41,858
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1855
02:14:43,826 --> 02:14:45,191
You were born to be a dad.

1856
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,705
So, you'll lead
the Guardians then?

1857
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:53,334
No.

1858
02:14:53,919 --> 02:14:55,409
I'm gonna lead the city,

1859
02:14:56,171 --> 02:14:57,912
make it the type of home
I never had.

1860
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:01,962
So, that's it?

1861
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:04,926
The group's over?

1862
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:06,633
No.

1863
02:15:06,932 --> 02:15:09,094
Well, the Galaxy
still needs its Guardians.

1864
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:13,053
And you will make a better
leader than I ever was,

1865
02:15:13,897 --> 02:15:14,897
Cap'n.

1866
02:15:35,336 --> 02:15:37,077
I love you, guys.

1867
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:46,218
<i>For you.</i>

1868
02:16:22,091 --> 02:16:28,428
<i>Like a train on a track</i>

1869
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:33,933
<i>Coming towards her</i>

1870
02:16:35,062 --> 02:16:41,525
<i>Stuck still, no turning back</i>

1871
02:16:43,404 --> 02:16:49,366
<i>She hid around corners
And she hid under beds</i>

1872
02:16:49,451 --> 02:16:54,742
<i>She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled</i>

1873
02:16:56,083 --> 02:17:01,499
<i>With every bubble
She sank with a drink</i>

1874
02:17:02,673 --> 02:17:08,385
<i>And washed it away down
The kitchen sink</i>

1875
02:17:09,012 --> 02:17:12,175
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1876
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:14,260
Hmm.

1877
02:17:15,227 --> 02:17:18,060
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1878
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:21,435
<i>So you better run</i>

1879
02:17:21,525 --> 02:17:24,893
<i>Run fast for your mother
Run fast for your father</i>

1880
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:28,275
<i>Run for your children
For your sisters and brothers</i>

1881
02:17:29,783 --> 02:17:31,023
<i>And your longing behind</i>

1882
02:17:31,118 --> 02:17:34,361
<i>You can't carry it with you
If you want to survive</i>

1883
02:17:34,455 --> 02:17:37,573
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1884
02:17:40,711 --> 02:17:42,327
<i>Can you hear the horses</i>

1885
02:17:42,421 --> 02:17:43,421
Yeah!

1886
02:17:43,505 --> 02:17:44,505
Oh, yeah!

1887
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:50,171
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1888
02:17:50,262 --> 02:17:51,627
Welcome home.

1889
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:53,588
<i>The dog days are done</i>

1890
02:17:53,682 --> 02:17:56,674
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1891
02:17:56,769 --> 02:17:59,727
<i>So you better run</i>

1892
02:17:59,813 --> 02:18:03,101
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1893
02:18:06,445 --> 02:18:09,528
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1894
02:18:22,127 --> 02:18:29,124
<i>And I never wanted</i>

1895
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:33,052
<i>Anything from you</i>

1896
02:18:34,348 --> 02:18:39,843
<i>Except everything...</i>

1897
02:18:39,937 --> 02:18:42,224
I think I might be
at the wrong, uh...

1898
02:18:43,315 --> 02:18:44,805
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1899
02:18:45,025 --> 02:18:46,140
Uh, yes.

1900
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:47,850
Come in.

1901
02:18:49,071 --> 02:18:52,189
<i>Happiness hit her</i>

1902
02:18:52,282 --> 02:18:53,818
<i>Like a bullet</i>

1903
02:18:53,909 --> 02:19:00,201
<i>In the back</i>

1904
02:19:01,667 --> 02:19:04,705
<i>Struck from a great height</i>

1905
02:19:06,004 --> 02:19:07,004
Pete?

1906
02:19:07,089 --> 02:19:08,875
<i>By someone who should know</i>

1907
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,470
Pete.

1908
02:19:19,059 --> 02:19:20,800
Hi, Grandpa.

1909
02:19:20,894 --> 02:19:23,226
<i>Can you hear the horses?</i>

1910
02:19:23,313 --> 02:19:26,772
<i>'Cause here they come</i>

1911
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:42,700
<i>Run fast for your father</i>

1912
02:19:44,126 --> 02:19:45,582
<i>For your sisters and brothers</i>

1913
02:19:45,669 --> 02:19:48,582
<i>Leave all your love
And your longing behind</i>

1914
02:19:48,672 --> 02:19:50,413
Yes! Yes!

1915
02:19:50,507 --> 02:19:52,214
Yeah! Yeah!

1916
02:19:52,301 --> 02:19:55,168
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1917
02:19:55,262 --> 02:19:57,549
Yeah!

1918
02:19:57,639 --> 02:19:59,175
Yeah!

1919
02:20:31,715 --> 02:20:36,551
<i>How young are you?
How old am I?</i>

1920
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:42,932
<i>Let's count the rings
Around my eye</i>

1921
02:20:48,774 --> 02:20:53,644
<i>How smart are you?
How dumb am I?</i>

1922
02:20:54,947 --> 02:20:59,566
<i>Don't count any of my advice</i>

1923
02:21:00,702 --> 02:21:05,412
<i>Oh, meet me anyplace
Or anywhere or anytime</i>

1924
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:08,412
<i>Now, I don't care
Meet me tonight</i>

1925
02:21:08,502 --> 02:21:12,461
<i>If you will dare, I might dare</i>

1926
02:21:17,594 --> 02:21:21,383
<i>Call me on Thursday
If you will...</i>

1927
02:21:23,684 --> 02:21:25,516
Okay, how about
your favorite musical act?

1928
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:27,225
Phyla, you first.

1929
02:21:27,688 --> 02:21:31,773
Um... Britney Spears and Korn.

1930
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:33,273
Good choices.

1931
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:36,068
I gotta go with the man.
Garth Brooks.

1932
02:21:36,154 --> 02:21:39,363
The Carpenters do not
have a single bad song.

1933
02:21:39,449 --> 02:21:40,655
Adrian Belew.

1934
02:21:40,951 --> 02:21:44,194
Both solo and his work
with King Crimson.

1935
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:46,116
What about you, Captain?

1936
02:21:46,206 --> 02:21:47,617
Uh, this one's kind of special.

1937
02:22:06,226 --> 02:22:07,762
Guess they're here.

1938
02:22:07,853 --> 02:22:11,596
Well, I can handle this
by my lonesome

1939
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:13,522
if y'all wanna chill.

1940
02:22:13,608 --> 02:22:14,608
Nah, nah.

1941
02:22:14,693 --> 02:22:16,434
It'll go faster
if we all do it together.

1942
02:22:17,112 --> 02:22:18,112
Groot, wake up.

Yeah, sure.

1947

But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

I mean, if she needs help
mowing her lawn, I'll do it,

2057
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:18,355
but I kinda feel like
her son should help.

2058
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:21,282
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

2059
02:29:21,369 --> 02:29:23,280
Like, he's a 45-year-old man,

2060
02:29:23,371 --> 02:29:25,328
able-bodied,
and I'm mowing his lawn.

2061
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:26,655
- It just feels weird.
- Mm-hmm.

2062
02:29:26,708 --> 02:29:28,244
Don't get me started.

2063
02:29:29,836 --> 02:29:31,622
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

2064
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:33,916
Now I kind of want to know.
