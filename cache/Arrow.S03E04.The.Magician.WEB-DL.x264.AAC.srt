1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,130
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,970
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,140
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,070
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,670
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,180
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,580
To the rest
of Starling city,

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,110
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,950
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,280
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,550
Oliver:
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
There's something
about Malcolm that both you

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,130
And Oliver need to know.
Malcolm is--

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,960
Aah!

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,070
I don't want to hurt,
or get hurt,

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,800
And you seem like someone
who could teach me how not to.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
You are my family.
I need you.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,040
Looks like
you're going home.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,480
Did Thea seem...
Different to you?

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,050
Where is she?

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,320
Where is Sara?

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,150
She came here
for the league
two weeks ago.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,390
We've not heard
from her since.

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,830
There's something
I have to tell you.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,330
Sara's dead?

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,210
I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,080
It was an arrow, wasn't it?

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,350
How do you know that?

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,250
Where's her body?
Nyssa...

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,890
We buried her
in her grave from
seven years ago.

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,530
[sighs]

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,170
She knows something.

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,640
I want you to follow her,
but be careful.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,580
I have to meet Thea.

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,080
Hi.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,520
Sorry I'm late.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,020
Late is your
"on time," Ollie.

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,890
So much for my promise
that things would be
different, right?

39
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,190
Relax, it's fine.

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,330
Dinner is on me.

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,730
With what money?

42
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,290
Aren't you broke?

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,730
Um...Aren't you?

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,630
Not so much,
actually.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,900
When I decided
to come back,

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,100
I had no idea
what I wanted to do,

47
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,010
And realized I kind
of missed the club.

48
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,040
And turns out,
a lot of other
people do, too.

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,550
I have investors.

50
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,180
And they're going
to help me buy
back the foundry

51
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,450
From Queen
consolidated.

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm thrilled for you,
that's fantastic.

53
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,590
You seem changed.

54
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,260
Stronger.

55
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,830
After last year,
I...

56
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,660
Don't see any other
way it could have
turned out.

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,730
And that's it?

58
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,900
You're not...

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Seeing someone,

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,640
Hoping Roy
didn't put you up
to asking that.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,040
No. I'm just trying
to figure out why
you're so different.

62
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,650
How about just being
my big brother
instead?

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,380
Ok.

64

[cell phone beeps]

66

Target's on the move.
He's headed north.

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
He's stopped.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,230
Maseo:
What's he doing?

69
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,870
He's buying ice cream.

70
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,400
He doesn't look like
a terrorist.

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,570
The best ones
never do.

72
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,570
Why does Waller want me
to take this guy out?

73
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,310
You ask too many
questions.

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,610
Follow orders
and eliminate
the target.

75
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,380
Or is this one
your best friend, too?

76
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,320
Oh, so I'm just a gun
that she can point at things

77
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,750
She doesn't like?

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,450
That's exactly
what you are.

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,760
He's moving.

80
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,660
Best not to waste
time, then.

81
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,540
Nyssa.

[speaking Arabic]

83
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,300
You have
my condolences.

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,810
And that
of my father,
Ra's al Ghul.

85
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't want
your condolences.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,850
And I definitely
don't want your father's.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,120
She died with arrows
in her chest.

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,890
Do you think that
would have happened

89
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,390
If she hadn't
met you?

90
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,530
You were the one
that showed her
the darkness inside.

91
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,630
You,

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,330
And your father.

93
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,130
I know you grieve.

94
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,570
But so do I.

95
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,240
I didn't show Sara
the darkness, Laurel.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,340
It was already inside
of her when we met.

97
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,140
When I found her, alone,

98
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,150
Starving and terrified,
I protected her.

99
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,480
I took Sara into my heart

100
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,150
And I loved her
with all of my soul.

101
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,990
And that jacket...

102
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,990
I gave it to Sara as a gift.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,670
You are not fit to wear it.

104

Roy: She's moving.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,570
She went to visit
Sara's grave

106
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,870
And now she's on
the top floor of some
dump on Amsterdam.

The trail for Sara's killer

And I could use your help.

Ok.

You said Sara
was in Starling
for the league.

128
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,800
That suggests
her target
is also her killer.

129

Agreed.

Except it wasn't her target.

131
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,140
Sara came to Starling
to confirm rumors--

Whispers, really--
that an enemy
of the league was here.

Who?

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,920
Malcolm Merlyn.

135
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,750
He's alive.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,130
Merlyn was a member
of the league of assassins.

137
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,200
My father released him
from his obligation to us

138

With the understanding
he would abide by
its code of conduct.

Violated
the league's
principles.

143

When you killed him,
we considered
the matter settled.

From a reliable
source that Merlyn
faked his demise.

Didn't the police,

Merlyn had resources
all over Starling.

I'm willing to bet
one of them was in
the coroner's office.

156
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,050
Since learning
Merlyn was alive,

The league has hunted
him all over the globe.

Following every whisper.

160

And one of those whispers
put Merlyn back in Starling.

She tracked him here.

We are going
to retrace her steps.

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,900
We found a blank piece
of paper in Sara's boot,

165
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,210
But why would she
be carrying a blank
piece of paper?

166
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,210
Do you have a flame?

167
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,550
Unbelievable.

168
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,720
My father had a notebook
with hidden writing
just like this.

169
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,990
The notebook
he received from
Merlyn, I imagine.

170
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,930
One of the means
the league employs
for concealing secrets.

171
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,390
It's Sara's handwriting.

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,330
Notes from her surveilLance
of Merlyn.

173
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,200
Oliver, there's not much
to go on here.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
There's a couple
of things.

175
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,870
Jansen,
question mark.

176
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,440
Dad help,

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,140
Question mark.

178
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,940
Sara reached out
to Lance.

179
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,280
If Lance knew Merlyn was
alive, don't you think
he would have told you?

180
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,210
Only if she told him.

181
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,320
What matters
is what he told her.

182
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,790
And how do we find that out?

183
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,360
[siren]
so, gentlemen,

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,220
Word of advice--
next time
you arrest a bookie,

185
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,630
Please make sure
the chief is not
one of his clients.

186
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,160
Now, that's what the chief
told me to tell you, ok,

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
But as far
as I'm concerned,

188
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,600
You just keep
doing your jobs.

189
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,930
First round tonight's
on me. Please,
get out of here.

190
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,370
Buying rounds?

191
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,370
The fastest way
to a cop's heart is
through his liver.

192
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,310
How you feeling?

193
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm fine.
Do you have a minute?

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,250
I have
to talk to you.

196
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,650
It's about Sara.

197
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,390
She, um...

198
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,590
She called me.

199
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,590
She said that she was
looking into something.

200
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,190
Something
called Jansen?

201
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,160
Um...

202
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,660
Ahem.

203
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,030
Uh, yeah, someone.

204
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,300
Ken Zhi Jansen.

205
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,170
I hooked her up with his
last known address.

206
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,840
Sara was here.

207
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,340
She asked me not
to say anything to you,

208
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,540
And I should have.

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,510
Maybe I should have,
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,850
It's ok. She was--

211
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,750
She's in
a mysterious
line of work.

212
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,720
Oh, yeah. One I hope
you're not getting
mixed up with.

213
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,560
No. I'm just doing
Sara a favor.

214
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,630
And her?

215
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,600
I'll be right back.

216
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,570
What are you doing here?

217
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,040
Oliver told me
of his plan
to involve you

218
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,940
In the hunt for
Sara's killer.

219
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,510
I have a handle on it.

220
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,680
Your father doesn't
know, does he?

221
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
No. He doesn't.

222
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,820
And he can't.
He has a heart condition.

223
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,080
He has the right
to avenge his daughter.

224
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,750
That is none
of your business.

225
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,590
Sara was everything
I hold dear
in this life,

226
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,090
Which is every bit
of my business.

227
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,990
And what would she say
if she was here now?

228
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,590
Hey. I almost
didn't recognize you

229
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,430
Without
your Halloween costume.

230
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,630
Is Sara back in town, too?

231
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,900
No, she is not.

232
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,340
But she told me
to tell you

233
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,270
That she misses you
very much.

234
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,840
The address I gave
your sister for Jansen.

235
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,080
Now she promised me
there wouldn't be any,
you know, assassinating.

236
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,350
Is that still the case?

237
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,150
I assure you,
Mr. Lance,

238
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,190
The only
objective here

239
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,060
Is justice.

240
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,400
This was the next lead
Sara was going to follow?

241
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Jansen's
a buddhist monk.

242
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,370
He was facing
deportation
in china.

243
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,710
Merlyn bankrolled
his defense.

244
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,810
And Jansen returns the favor
by giving Merlyn asylum

245
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,580
In his garden.
Monastery.

246
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,410
We should divide
our forces, take our
flanking positions.

247
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,680
I agree,
but not--

248
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,090
Never understood what
Sara saw in her
in the first place.

249
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,060
Split up,

250
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,620
But be careful.
Got it.

251
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,260
John: Oliver,
we found Jansen.

252
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,530
Negative.

253
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,660
I have eyes on him.

254
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,840
Whoever's up there
is not Jansen.

255
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,010
Jansen sensei,
I am Nyssa, daughter

256
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,340
Of Ra's al Ghul.
Heir to the demon.

257
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,110
You will tell me where I can
find Malcolm Merlyn

258
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,620
Or I will kill you
where you sit.

259
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,690
Hello, Nyssa.

260
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,140
Where is he?!

261
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,920
What's going on?

262
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Did you find
Sara's killer?

263
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,260
We have a suspect.

264
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,760
Malcolm Merlyn's alive.

265
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,700
Sara was here
looking for him.

266
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
We think
he found her first.

267
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,300
And where is he now?
We're working on that.

268
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,610
He got away from us
earlier tonight.

269
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,580
But not before
I hit him with an arrow

270
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,210
Laced with particulate
nanotechnology.

271
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,980
Felicity wrote
a program that tracks
the nanites using gps.

272
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,050
The tracer arrow.
Yeah.

273
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,650
You had a shot at Merlyn
and you didn't kill him?

274
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,360
I tagged him.
With a flesh wound!

275
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,560
There's nowhere in
the world he can go
where I can't find him.

276
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
And when you do?

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,430
I'm not a killer
anymore, Laurel.

278
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,870
Merlyn is.

279
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,940
He killed Tommy

280
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,540
And 502 other innocent people.

281
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,170
How many more people
are going to have to die
before you put him down?

282
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,440
Do you think that's
what your sister
would want?

283
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,410
Yes. I do.

284
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,160
Merlyn may try
to contact Thea.

285
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,460
I'm on it.

286
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,400
The tracer arrow
program...

287
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,640
You have Felicity monitoring
remote from central city?

288
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,670
No, she told me
an idiot could run it.

289
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,440
I will try very hard not
to take that personally.

290
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,810
I'll be on the streets.

291
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,710
Talk me in when
you have his location.

292
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,810
Copy that.

293
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,770
[beep]

294
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,510
It's done.

295
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,110
Nyssa: Laurel.

296
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,480
I just found out
that Malcolm Merlyn
isn't only alive,

297
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,280
But that he killed my sister.
I'm sure you can understand

298
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,380
Why I don't want
to talk right now.

299
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,290
I understand.

300
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,790
I loved her, too.

301
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,200
Sorry for your loss.

302
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,700
I promise Sara,

303
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,830
And I promise you--

304
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,440
We will find
Malcolm Merlyn.

305
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,010
Apparently you already did.

306
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,740
And Oliver should have
killed him.

307
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,510
Yes.

308
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,220
If Oliver catches up
with Merlyn,

309
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,620
He's going to let him live
or let him go.

310
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,790
You can't let that happen.

311
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,790
You need to get Merlyn.

312
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,900
You have to do
whatever it takes.

313
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,410
Hey.

314
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,880
Grand reopening's not
for another three weeks.

315
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,010
Well, looks like
you've still got
a lot more work to do.

316
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,680
Need some help?

317
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,920
But don't really think
that's a good idea.

318
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,350
Just as friends.

319
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,020
And former
co-workers.

320
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,260
[exhales]

321
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,960
Bonsai green,
October mist,

322
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,300
Or avocado?

323
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,700
John: Merlyn stopped.
I've got his position.

324
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,640
Go.

325
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,340
Air conditioner factory.

326
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,210
You want me to share
this with Nyssa?

327
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,850
No. She's liable to
put an arrow in him

328
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,750
Before I get
any answers.

329
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,580
Agreed.

330
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,620
[exhales]

331
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,260
This place is empty.
He's not here, Diggle.

332
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,460
Malcolm:
Hello, Oliver.

333
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,870
I'm not at the--
what is it, the air
conditioning factory?

334
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,640
It's a very neat trick
you have, but I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

335
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,770
When I find you...
You absolutely will.

336
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,370
We need to talk.

337
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,280
But I prefer a venue
less conducive
to conflict.

338
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,650
Nelson plaza
at coldwater and fifth,

339
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,310
Bottom of the stairs.
It's a very public place;

340
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,350
You'll want to leave
your mask behind.

341
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,520
I think this should remain
between the two of us,

342
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,220
So if I even see
one of your associates,

343
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,160
I promise you,
you will not see me.

344
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,810
Malcolm: Hello, Oliver!

345
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,350
How are you?

346
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,750
You've accomplished
a lot with this city, I see.

347
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,250
I'm not here
to discuss Starling.

348
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,320
You think I killed Sara Lance.

349
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,720
How else would
you know she's dead?

350
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,400
These streets were mine long
before you laid claim to them.

351
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,330
This is still my city.

352
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,570
I chose this place
because of the crowds.

353
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,600
Besides, I understand
you're not killing
people these days.

354
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,270
Seriously considering
making an exception.

355
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,110
Ra's al Ghul has placed
a blood bounty on my head.

356
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:20,710
Why would I try to get it
lifted by killing the love
of his daughter's life?

357
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
It's illogical!

358
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,380
Sara comes back
to Starling.

359
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,690
You come back
to Starling.

360
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,160
I came back for the simplest
and most noble of reasons--

361
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,390
Thea.

362
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,490
Six months ago,
during the siege,

363
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,100
She was almost killed
by one of Slade Wilson's

364
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,900
Mirakuru soldiers.
I protected her!

365
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,270
You're lying.

366
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,170
Thea made it out
before the attack.

367
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,600
Unfortunately,
she didn't make it out.

368
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,540
But you wouldn't know that,
because you were out being--

369
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,510
What are you calling yourself
these days? "the arrow."

370
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,910
That was the night I realized
that Thea needs me!

371
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,320
Stay away from her.

372
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,150
Don't worry.

373
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,920
I've kept my distance.

374
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,820
[exhales]

375
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,760
But the world
is a dangerous place.

376
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,890
And you're too distracted
to protect her.

377
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,360
You're a killer.
Yes, I am.

378
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,600
But I swear.

379
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,900
I swear to you
on Thea's life...

380
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,210
I am not Sara Lance's killer.

381
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,990
From the look on your
face, you need something
stronger than coffee.

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,260
You ok?

383
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,700
Yeah, are you?

384
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,670
[sighs] back
in Corto Maltese,

385
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,230
I promised you there
would be no more secrets.

386
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,540
No more lies.
And I'm trying to honor that.

387
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,740
Ok...

388
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,380
I learned something last night

389
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,980
That's going to be
difficult for you to hear.

390
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,520
I think that it's what
mom was trying to tell us

391
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,120
The night she died,
right before...

392
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,260
The night of the siege,
you were at the train station.

393
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Yeah. I...
It wasn't fun.

394
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,330
I got attacked
by one of those
crazy masked things

395
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,900
And he tried
to strangle me.

396
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,640
But he got shot
by a cop, I think.

397
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Did you see him?

398
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,250
No.

399
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,550
Why are you asking?

400
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,020
It wasn't a cop, Thea.

401
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,960
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

402
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,990
He's dead.

403
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,160
How do you
know this?

404
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,270
One of Sara's friends saw him.

405
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,470
She's sure.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,740
If he was going to try
to contact you, he would
have done it by now.

407
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,180
Ok?
Thank you.

408
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,980
For telling me.

409
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,210
[cell phone beeps]

410
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,350
It's, uh, one
of my investors. I--

411
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,990
Are you ok?

412
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,790
Yeah. I'm--

413
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,890
I'm fine. I--

414
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,590
It's like you said;
if he was going
to contact me,

415
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,030
He probably would
have done it by now.

416
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,710
Where's Oliver?

417
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,010
Out, taking care
of some family business.

418
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,580
As if there weren't more
pressing matters at hand.

419
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,380
He's not doing
nothing. He tracked
down Merlyn last night.

420
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,490
Did he kill him?

421
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,590
No.

422
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,220
He swore to me
he didn't kill Sara.

423
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,490
And you know all
of his words are lies.

424
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,530
I believe him.

425
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,890
Because he swore to me

426
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,230
On his daughter's life.

427
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,970
We had heard rumors
Merlyn fathered
another child.

428
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,970
We couldn't
confirm them.

429
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,080
You know who it is.

430
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,910
I do.

431
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,150
If you put me
through the effort

432
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,150
Of finding out
on my own...

433
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,920
I might have
to exact a price

434
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,350
From whoever it is
you're protecting.

435
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,430
My sister
is Merlyn's daughter.

436
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,000
And that is the reason
he came back to Starling city.

437
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,270
Because she did.

438
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,270
He's protecting her.

439
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,100
And that is why you
spared Merlyn. Twice!

440
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,340
It had nothing
to do with that.

441
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,080
He explained to me--
in his own twisted way--

442
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,380
That he loves her.

443
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,480
And then he swore
to me on her life.

444
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,150
And I swore
an oath of my own

445
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,790
That I would see
Sara's killer
brought to justice.

446
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,190
Nyssa...Nyssa!

447
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,030
Oliver, wait.

448
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,690
We need to stop her!
Do we?

449
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,500
Listen, I understand why
you can't kill Merlyn,

450
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
All of the reasons.

451
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,070
Maybe he killed Sara,
maybe he didn't.

452
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,070
He didn't.
Either way!

453
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,500
The world is
a better place

454
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,910
Without
Malcolm Merlyn
in it.

455
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,910
You made a vow
not to kill.

456
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,610
Nyssa didn't.

457
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,490
Where's your wife?

458
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,920
Tatsu. She needed to be
someplace else.

459
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Ah. She doesn't like me.

460
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,930
You're wrong.
She hates you.

461
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,260
She's not happy
that I'm here.

462
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,530
Neither am I.

463
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,340
I killed a man today.

464
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,070
I don't even know the reason.

465
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,840
Sometimes it's
better that way.

466
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,080
What, blindly
following orders is better?

467
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,580
I'm not blind, Oliver.
I'm focused--

468
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,620
On what's most
important.

469
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,250
You should do the same.

470
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,650
It's not our place
or our burden

471
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,360
To know why
we carry out
our missions.

472
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,560
I didn't realize
having a conscience
was a burden.

473
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,740
[keys jingle]

474
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,700
What are you playing?

475
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,310
A reading game.

476
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh, yeah? Do you mind if I try?

477
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,680
I want to work
on my cantonese.

478
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,750
My dad said I shouldn't
let you use my computer.

479
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,610
Ok.

480
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,110
Why don't we make
a deal, then?

481
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,150
You don't have anything.
You're a bum.

482
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:37,120
Well, this bum has something
that you don't have.

483
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,620
Height.

484
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,260
That your parents
keep in the cupboard
above the fridge?

485
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,900
I'll swipe you two pieces.

486
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,070
Five.
Three.

487
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,900
Fine, five.
Give me the computer.

488
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,180
I need a meet
with Waller.

489
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,150
How did you--akio!

490
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,520
It's not his fault.
I need a meet.
Make it happen.

491
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,950
Waller's going
to want a reason.

492
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,620
Ferris air
flight 637.

493
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,160
She'll know
what I mean.

494
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,290
Thanks for your help.

495
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,700
I mean, you really
didn't have to do all that.

496
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
I like painting.

497
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,100
It actually helps me
turn my brain off.

498
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,140
You know, I actually wish
you were still trying
to get into my pants,

499
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,770
Because this whole
zen helpful Roy thing

500
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,580
Is really freaking me out.

501
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,790
Get away from him.

502
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm not here
for him.

503
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,790
Roy: Thea...

504
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,080
Thea?

505
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,610
Thea, are you here?

506
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,680
[sighs]

507
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,430
So Malcolm Merlyn is alive,
and Thea's father.

508
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,760
Anything else
you haven't told me?

509
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,400
What did you get
at the precinct?

510
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,530
But I did get this
off a traffic camera.

511
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
It was recorded
10 minutes ago.

512
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,370
After I struck out
on anything related
to Nyssa or Thea,

513
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,610
I just looked for strange.

514
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,480
Well, that
definitely counts.

515
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Sara.

516
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,810
She never said much
about the leak.

517
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,780
But she did say that
their communication system

518
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,720
Was a little outdated.
Smoke signal.

519
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,090
Nyssa's sending
Malcolm a message.

520
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,790
I don't know
about the cipher,
but I'm willing

521
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,490
To bet my wallet that means
"we got your daughter."

522
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,990
Doesn't matter.
Video gives me
her location.

523
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,530
You mean "us"
on location, right?

524
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,990
No. I need you
to secure
the perimeter.

525
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,430
Can't risk Thea
seeing you.

526
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,770
She already knows
I know about
the arrow.

527
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,500
Not with a dose
of league tranquilizer
in your system.

528
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,410
Oliver.
This is my fault.

529
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,510
I told Nyssa
to go after Merlyn.

530
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,140
I told her to do
whatever it takes.

531
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,340
It's ok.

532
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,550
I know you're not a killer.

533
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,180
But he is.

534
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,320
Whatever else he means
to you or to Thea...

535
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,390
Know that.

536
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,470
I'm going to get free
of this, and when I do,
I'm going to kill you!

537
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,300
Nyssa: I apologize
for involving you in this.

538
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,140
My quarrel
is with your father.

539
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,180
My father's been
dead for years,
you crazy psycho bitch.

540
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,080
Not robert Queen.
Your true father--

541
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,910
Al sa-her. "the magician."

542
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,680
Known to the uninitiated
as Malcolm Merlyn.

543
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,220
Then you know what
he's going to do to
you when he gets here.

544
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,750
I know he'll die.
My father taught me ways

545
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,620
To cut a man to make
his death last for days.

546
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,160
Sounds like
father of the year.

547
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,690
My father may be the demon...

548
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,930
But yours is the devil.

549
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,540
Run!

550
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,450
Apparently we both
handle grief differently.

551
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,870
Malcolm: There's
a misunderstanding

552
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,610
The three of us
need to clear up.

553
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,540
A conversation I am
eager to have...

554
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,280
Over your rotting corpse.

555
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,610
Nyssa: Do it, Oliver.

556
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,510
He killed Sara.

557
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,410
Tommy.

558
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,980
He will corrupt
your sister.

559
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,880
[grunts]

560
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,920
There is blood
on my hands.

561
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,220
Almost too much
to contemplate.

562
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,960
But none
of it is Sara's.

563
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,190
Kill him!

564
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,390
I did not kill
your beloved!

565
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,430
Your father doubted
Sara's loyalties

566
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,570
The moment
you brought her home.

567
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,700
You know your father.

568
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,840
What he is capable of.

569
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,210
He will kill
without hesitation.

570
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,310
Do you really
need me to tell you
what he would do

571
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,310
To the degenerate
who would steal
his daughter's heart?

572
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,420
[groans]

573
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,230
Nyssa doesn't
believe me, Oliver.

574
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,900
If you don't
believe me...

575
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,770
Listen to her.

576
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,370
Kill me.

577
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,250
You may not have
killed Sara...

578
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,490
But you're still a murderer.

579
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,860
What are you
going to do?

580
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,890
Arrest me?

581
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,590
I could have scpd here

582
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,430
In three minutes.

583
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,130
And in half that time,
I will escape

584
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,130
From whatever prison
they put me in.

585
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,970
You know that,
so does she.

586
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,240
We were trained
by the league;
no prison can hold us!

587
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,510
Not even your one
on Lian Yu.

588
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,880
Which leaves you
with only

589
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,320
One option.

590
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,390
To break your vows...

591
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,360
And kill me.

592
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,090
Kill your sister's
father.

593
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,140
[Nyssa groaning
and gasping]

594
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,410
Is Thea ok?

595
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,910
I just spoke to her.
She's fine.

596
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,580
Doesn't know
who took her or why.

597
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,890
I may have
deserved that.

598
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,290
You deserve worse.

599
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,290
Um, what's going on?

600
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,430
Merlyn didn't
kill Sara.

601
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,160
Which means
whoever did
is still out there.

602
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,200
You're a fool

603
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,630
Who insults the memory
of a woman he once loved.

604
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,500
I will honor Sara's
memory by finding
and punishing

605
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,010
The person
who did this.

606
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,570
The real person.

607
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,210
Nyssa.

608
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,610
So as long
as Malcolm Merlyn
is in my city,

609
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,350
The league will make
no move on him.

610
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,120
He's under
my protection.

611
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,520
You would incur the wrath
of the league of assassins?

612
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,190
I would do...

613
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,830
What I have to

614
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,860
In order to buy
the time necessary

615
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,700
To find out
what really
happened with Sara.

616
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,670
You have made
an enemy tonight.

617
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,670
One with a long memory.

618
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,640
Oliver.

619
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,050
Are you sure?

620
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,120
If I wasn't sure,
I never would
have let him go.

621
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,220
I promise.

622
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,920
What did I miss?

623
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,060
Amanda: I hate Hong Kong.

624
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,990
And I hate
transpacific flights.

625
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,430
And do not even get me
started on the topic

626
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,670
Of being summoned
by one of my operatives.

627
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,970
Ferris air
flight 637.

628
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,770
Paris to Hong Kong
nonstop.

629
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,500
You prevented that flight
from being shot over Lian Yu.

630
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,540
Were you watching me?!
Via keyhole hexagon satellite.

631
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,740
How else was I supposed
to know you possess

632
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,710
The capabilities I require?

633
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,280
That business
with the freighter last year...

634
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,480
Impressive.

635
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,350
Are we done?

636
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,920
Just getting started,
actually.

637
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,720
Adam Castwidth

638
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,890
The man
you had me murder.

639
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,730
He was Edward Fyers'
handler.

640
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,400
And he worked for you.

641
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,330
You're out of your depth,
Mr. Queen!

642
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,070
I don't think I am.
I think Mr. Castwidth

643
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,140
Had a usb drive on him
detailing everything.

644
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,240
I think he knew that
you told fyers to
shoot the plane down.

645
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,040
And I think that
you wanted him silenced!

646
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,980
And the world
thinks you dead,
Mr. Queen.

647
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,180
The convenient thing
about dead men

648
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,610
Is that no one tends
to believe them.

649
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,980
Yeah, well, what
about dead men who
make arrangements

650
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,680
To get
the information
on that usb drive

651
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,090
In the hands of every
blogger and journalist
in this hemisphere.

652
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,190
If anything happens
to Maseo's family,

653
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,920
Then you're going
to spend a long time

654
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,690
Testifying in front
of the senate
sub-committee.

655
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,800
The world's a much more
complicated place

656
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,330
Than you realize.

657
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,540
Edward Fyers thought
he was to shoot down that plane

658
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,870
To destabilize
the Chinese economy.

659
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,440
In truth, I wanted
to take out a single target.

660
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,880
So you blow up a plane
full of innocent people

661
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,850
To take out one man.

662
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,710
No.

663
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,350
To take out one woman.

664
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,450
Chien na Wei.

665
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,120
Two years ago,
we had our only chance at her.

666
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,790
And you saved her life.

667
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,260
And now she's in Hong Kong.

668
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,000
I need to know why.

669
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,700
[grunting]

670
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,580
Laurel: I thought you were
going back to your father.

671
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,440
I thought
I owed you
a good-bye.

672
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,150
I intend to make
good on my promise
to Sara.

673
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,080
And to you.

674
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
[exhales]

675
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,650
It kills me that
he's still out there.

676
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,190
Merlyn.

677
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,960
Someone.

678
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,060
It kills me.

679
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,800
It pains me
as well.

680
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,200
I see you've
been training...

681
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
And wearing
the jacket.

682
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,470
If you're going
to stand there
and tell me

683
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,470
I'm not strong enough
or tough enough, please...

684
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,640
Don't.

685
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,210
Back at the cemetery,
I would have.

686
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,780
But since,
you've reminded me

687
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,650
That the strongest
metal is forged
in the hottest fire.

688
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,590
And what's that
supposed to mean?

689
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,120
Don't forget
to turn your hips.

690
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,560
It's where the power
comes from.

[siren]

692
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,540
Sara, on voice mail:
It's Sara. Leave a message.

693
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,640
Sara. Sweetie,
it's, uh, it's me.

694
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,410
Look, I know you said
only call this number
in an emergency.

695
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,740
And it's not. It's not.
Everything's fine.

696
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,180
But I--I just...

697
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,520
[sighs] I just want
to hear your voice.

698
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,180
Look, I know wherever you are,
you're looking after yourself.

699
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,850
But, you know,
that doesn't mean
I don't worry.

700
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,030
So, you know,
you don't have to
call me back or anything,

701
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,730
Just, I just
want you to remember--

702
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,170
That I love you.

703
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,370
Are you ok?

704
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,040
It's not my first time
being kidnapped.

705
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,610
That's not what
I meant.

706
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,510
I never imagined
you and scrubbing.

707
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,580
Unless
a spa treatment
was involved.

708
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,520
I spoke
to detective Lance.

709
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,590
He doesn't think
that woman's going
to bother you again.

710
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,560
Why did she come after me
in the first place?

711
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,600
Maybe she thought
the Queens
still had money.

712
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
I wish.

713
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,700
But thank you
for checking in on me.

714
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,270
I'm always going
to watch out for you.

715
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,570
Always.

716
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,910
Sorry, guys, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

717
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,010
I was just leaving.

718
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,710
Take care
of yourself.

719
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,050
I thought you had
guys for that.

720
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,690
It's kind of zen.

721
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,990
But you've got that same
worried look on your face

722
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,790
My brother had.
And really, I'm fine.

723
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,160
Good.

724
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,030
I just wanted
to make sure
you're ok.

725
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,470
And I wanted
to apologize.

726
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,370
I'm sorry
I couldn't stop her.

727
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,410
You tried.

728
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,740
Those were some
nice moves back there.

729
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,410
Whatever you're doing
with the arrow

730
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,010
Is clearly paying off.

731
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,720
You know, maybe I should
apply for a job here

732
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,020
As one of your bouncers.

733
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,750
I think I got
that covered.

734
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,220
But I could use
an assistant
manager.

735
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,490
For real?

736
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I need somebody
who knows the place
as well as I do.

737
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,930
Absolutely.
Purely platonic.

738
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,200
Understood.

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,680
I should probably
take this.

I am now.

745
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,820
Is that woman gone?

746
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,190
For now.
And your brother?

747
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,720
He's completely in the dark.
He doesn't know a thing.

748
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,330
But thank you, dad.

749
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,060
For what?

750
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,170
For taking care of me.

751
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,430
I promised you, Thea.

752
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,670
I will never
let anyone hurt you.

The rumors were true.

At Merlyn's hand?

762
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,380
It appears.

763
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,550
I have vowed a blood
oath to avenge her.

764

Al sa-her will face
the league's justice.

But for his crimes
against our code.

But Sara--

767
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,430
Was never truly
one of us.

And what of Queen?

He has sworn to protect
Merlyn at any cost.

770

If that is true,

Then Oliver Queen
courts war with us.
