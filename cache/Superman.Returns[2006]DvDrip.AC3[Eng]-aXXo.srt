SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006)

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,480
<i>You will travel far, my little Kal-El.</i>

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,120
<i>But we will never leave you...</i>

5
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
<i>...even in the face of our deaths.</i>

6
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
<i>You will make my strength your own.</i>

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,160
<i>You will see my life through your eyes...</i>

8
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,720
<i>...as your life will be seen through mine.</i>

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.</i>

10
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,520
<i>In spite of your past...</i>

11
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,280
...I know you're a good man.

12
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
And all good men...

13
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
...deserve a second chance.

14
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,040
From the moment
I received your first letter...

15
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,920
...I knew you were not like the rest.

16
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
You came from nothing...

17
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,480
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

18
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,120
You might have made a few mistakes.

19
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,160
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

20
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,720
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

21
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,240
...you'd take care of me.

22
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,280
And you have.

23
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,640
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

24
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,400
That's why you deserve...

25
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,400
...everything.

26
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
I love you...

27
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,640
...Lex Luthor.

28
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

29
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,720
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

30
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,200
He's a monster! Gertrude!

31
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,240
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

32
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,640
The rest is mine.

33
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,440
We're done.

34
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,840
Bye, Martha.

35
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Oh, Clark.

36
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,760
Oh, my boy.

37
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,400
Will you get that thing out of my face!

38
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

39
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

40
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,200
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

41
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

42
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,640
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

43
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

44
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

45
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,080
...and gave control of it to mortals.

46
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,800
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

47
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,360
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

48
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,000
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

49
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,720
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

50
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,720
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

51
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

52
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

53
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,840
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

54
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,680
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

55
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

56
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,760
Hey, boss.

57
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
We found something.

58
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,240
No, I don't wanna be a god.

59
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,360
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

60
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,920
And I want my cut.

61
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,120
Was this his house?

62
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
You might think so. Most would.

63
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,440
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

64
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,080
...and extremely powerful civilization.

65
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,800
This is where he learned who he was.

66
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,840
This is where he came for guidance.

67
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,280
Possibilities.

68
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
Endless possibilities.

69
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
You act like you've been here before.

70
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,120
<i>My son...</i>

71
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,840
<i>...you do not remember me.</i>

72
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,800
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

73
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>I'm your father.</i>

74
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,280
<i>By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.</i>

75
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,800
<i>- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.</i>

76
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,400
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

77
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,320
<i>...and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...</i>

78
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,760
<i>...spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

79
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

80
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
<i>Here in this...</i>

81
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,360
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

82
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,240
<i>...we shall try to find
the answers together.</i>

83
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Can he see us?

84
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,120
No, he's dead.

85
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
<i>So, my son...</i>

86
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,760
<i>...Kal-El...</i>

87
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,080
<i>...speak.</i>

88
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,560
Tell me everything...

89
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,240
...starting with crystals.

90
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
Hey, boy.

91
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,200
<i>- on Tuesday, between support...</i>

92
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,600
<i>- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...</i>

93
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,240
<i>Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.</i>

94
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,840
<i>Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...</i>

95
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,320
<i>...with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.</i>

96
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,160
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

97
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,280
<i>- it was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.</i>

98
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,880
Mom?

99
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,160
Five years.

100
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,240
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

101
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,440
I almost gave up hope.

102
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,720
I just thought
I would never see you again.

103
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,920
Oh, Clark.

104
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,440
Did you find what you were looking for?

105
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,800
I thought, hoped...

106
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,320
...it might still be there.

107
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,720
Your home?

108
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,360
That place was a graveyard.

109
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,160
I'm all that's left.

110
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,720
Clark, the universe is a big place.

111
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,400
And you don't know who's out there.

112
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,480
And even if you are the last...

113
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,720
...you're not alone.

114
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,880
I know.

115
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,720
- Sorry.
- Look out!

116
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,080
Watch out, will you?

117
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,680
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

118
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,480
Sorry.

119
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,800
Great. Would you be careful?

120
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,120
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

121
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

122
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,040
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

123
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,440
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

124
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,280
...if you know of anything reasonable.

125
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,960
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

126
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
Oh, it looks...

127
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
...delicious.

128
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,680
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

129
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

130
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,040
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

131
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

132
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,040
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

133
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,720
It was his time.

134
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,400
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

135
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Okay, so I gotta run...

136
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,080
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

137
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

138
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,880
<i>The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...</i>

139
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,120
<i>...is the most precarious part
of the launch.</i>

140
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,840
<i>Lois Lane, Daily Planet.</i>

141
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,120
<i>You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...</i>

142
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>...enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.</i>

143
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
<i>But can you tell us the exact price...</i>

144
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,000
<i>...an "average person"
will be expected to pay?</i>

145
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,760
<i>The answer to that question
is in your press packet.</i>

146
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,560
<i>The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...</i>

147
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>...which we call the atmosphere.</i>

148
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,600
<i>It reaches over...</i>

149
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,440
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

150
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,440
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

151
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,040
Mother?

152
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,280
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

153
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,680
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

154
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

155
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,680
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

156
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,040
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

157
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,560
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

158
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,120
...because she hates that question.

159

with the Air Force...</i>

161
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,760
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

162
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

163
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,840
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

164
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,680
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

165
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,600
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

166
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,960
Weren't there two of those?

167
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

168
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,720
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

169
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,200
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

170
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,680
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

171
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,440
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

172
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,640
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

173
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,000
But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...

174
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,120
...entire continents...

175
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,080
...all grown.

176
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,640
To think that one could create
a new world...

177
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,680
...with such a simple little object.

178
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,520
It's like a seed.

179
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,840
And all it needs is water.

180
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Like...

181
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,080
...Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,880
Exactly, Kitty.

183
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Like Sea-Monkeys.

184
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,520
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

185
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,600
- He saw Ilamas.
- Yeah?

186
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,720
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

187
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
- Coming back?
- To work.

188
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,720
Yeah.

189
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,600
Well, you know, things change.

190
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,720
I mean, of course things change...

191
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,520
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

192
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
Take Lois.

193
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,440
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

194
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,400
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

195
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,240
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

196
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,960
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

197
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,760
...just in the initial launch phase.

198
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,480
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

199
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,600
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

200
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,960
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

201
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,200
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

202
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,920
How about that, Miss Lane?

203
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,400
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

204
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,120
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

205
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,240
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

206
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,440
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

207
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,840
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

208
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
- Careful.
- I know.

209
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,280
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

210
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,760
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,120
Wait for it.

212
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,040
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

213
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>It's freaking Gone With the Wind.</i>

214
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,600
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

215
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,720
I said, shut off the damn camera.

216
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,480
I think I did something wrong.

217
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,800
No. That wasn't you.

218
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
<i>Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.</i>

219
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,360
CDR., start the clock.

220
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,200
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

221
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,520
<i>Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.</i>

222
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

223
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,600
<i>- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.</i>

224
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,560
<i>- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?</i>

225
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Oh, God.

226
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,440
<i>Electrical variance.</i>

227
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,560
What the...?

228
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,120
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

229
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,360
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

230
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,480
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me. It just cycled back up.

231
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
<i>Genesis, radio check from Houston.</i>

232
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,520
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

233
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,320
<i>- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.</i>

234
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,920
<i>And it's gone! A blazing fastball...</i>

235
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,680
Is that it?

236
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
I don't think so.

237
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,680
<i>Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.</i>

238
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,560
<i>Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.</i>

239
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,120
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

240
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

241
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,680
<i>- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.</i>

242
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,160
<i>Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.</i>

243
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,560
<i>Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.</i>

244
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,600
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

245
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
<i>- What?
- Release couplings.</i>

246
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
<i>We can't shut down boosters.</i>

247
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,920
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

248
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,560
<i>T minus 23 seconds to ignition.</i>

249
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,040
<i>Genesis, you're a go
for evac procedures.</i>

250
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,920
<i>Twenty-one, 20...</i>

251
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>...19...</i>

252
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,080
Couplings are non-responsive.

253
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,080
<i>- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.</i>

254
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,040
<i>- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.</i>

255
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,920
<i>Fourteen.</i>

256
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,440
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

257
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,080
<i>We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.</i>

258
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
<i>- Nine, eight...
- Houston, can you do a remote override?</i>

259
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>...seven...</i>

260
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,120
<i>- Remote override is unresponsive.
...six, five...</i>

<i>- I repeat, remote override is unresponsive.
...four, three...</i>

262
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,520
And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

263

<i>- Houston, we have ignition.

<i>- a problem with the launch

<i>The reports are telling us
the shuttle failed to disengage...</i>

<i>...sending both crafts

<i>Jim, all we know right now...</i>

<i>...is that the couplings

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,040
<i>...malfunctioned

<i>- We're uncertain...

<i>...why the ignition sequence
continued and boosters fired.</i>

There's some kind of unidentified bogey

Well, I hope this experience

Gossip, has he met somebody?
Fashion, is that a new suit?

Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

310
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Business, how is this gonna affect
the stock market? Long-term, short-term.

"Superman Returns."

313
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,360
Come on.

314
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,000
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

315
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,680
None. What's the usage?

316
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,920
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

317
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,920
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

318
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,560
- Lois!
- Yes.

319
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,280
In my office.

320
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
This goes for everyone.

321
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,040
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

322
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,920
The story is the EMP, chief.

323
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,440
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

324
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,640
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

325
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,680
Lois, three things sell papers:
tragedy, sex and Superman.

326
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,280
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

327
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,880
<i>That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.</i>

328
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,840
Lois?

329
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,600
<i>- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

330
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,320
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.</i>

331
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,040
<i>- Where's Jason?
- I don't know. Isn't he with you?</i>

332
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,480
<i>- No.
- Well, where is he?</i>

333
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,160
Hi.

334
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,920
Hello.

335
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
Who are you?

336
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

337
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,120
Really? She never mentioned you.

338
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,440
Really? Never?

339
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,840
- No.
- Jason.

340
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,520
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

341
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,440
Daddy's office is boring?

342
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,160
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

343
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,440
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

344
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,560
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

345
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,840
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

346
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

347
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,280
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

348
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,640
- Yes?
- Yes.

349
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,080
Oh, I saw you on the...

350
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,200
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

351
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,160
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,680
Thanks.

353
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,240
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

354
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,480
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

355
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,200
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

356
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,920
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

357
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,440
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

358
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,000
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

359
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,320
- How are you?
- Good.

360
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

361
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,160
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

362
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,160
- Please?
- Again?

363
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,360
- Again.
- You got it.

364
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,480
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

365
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,360
Oh, this is Clark.

366
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,880
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

367
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,240
Hi.

368
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,600
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

369
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,480
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

370
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,280
Clark is...

371
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,760
Well, he's Clark.

372
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,640
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

373
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,640
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

374
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,040
- Gotta run.
- Where?

375
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,280
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

376
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,960
To what?

377
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,400
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

378
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,240
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

379
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,720
Okay.

380
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,080
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

381
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,280
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

382
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,280
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

383
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,800
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

384
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,480
Nice to finally meet you.

385
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,720
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

386
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,440
<i>And he's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

387
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,680
<i>He's got the whole world</i>

388
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,320
<i>And he's got the whole world in his...</i>

389
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, he's cute.

390
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,600
Run into trouble?

391
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,920
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

392
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,680
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

393
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,640
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

394
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,520
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

395
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,360
How does it feel to be back at work?

396
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,600
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

397
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,120
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

398
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,680
Never mind.

399
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,040
But I was wondering...

400
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,280
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

401
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,240
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

402
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,440
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

403
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,840
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

404
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,560
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

405
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,120
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

406
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
...or without even saying goodbye?

407
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,280
Sounds cheesy, I know.

408
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,960
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

409
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,840
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

410
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,240
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

411
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,640
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

412
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,360
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

413
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,040
Who are we talking about?

414
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,920
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

415
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,000
Taxi! Hey!

416
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,360
Taxi!

417
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,640
Wow, thanks.

418
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
312 Riverside Drive, please.

419
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,040
Good night, Clark.

420
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,320
Superman!

421
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,360
<i>I want egg rolls.</i>

422
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,520
<i>Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.</i>

423
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,640
<i>Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?</i>

424
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,520
<i>Because he loves the peas...</i>

425
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,920
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

426
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,520
It's a good point.

427
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,920
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

428
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,640
Have I?

429
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,880
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

430
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

431
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,760
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

432
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,320
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

433
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,320
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

434
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,160
Richard, come on.

435
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,200
It was the title of an interview.

436
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,280
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

437
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,360
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

438
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,880
It was a long time ago.

439
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,320
Were you in love with him?

440
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,080
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

441
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,480
But were you?

442
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,400
<i>No.</i>

443
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,640
<i>Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.</i>

444
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,880
<i>Even though you've been
raised as a human being...</i>

445
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
<i>...you are not one of them.</i>

446
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,160
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.</i>

447
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,320
<i>They only lack the light
to show the way.</i>

448
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,320
<i>For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

449
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,400
<i>...I have sent them you...</i>

450
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,440
<i>...my only son.</i>

451
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,960
Load them up.

452
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Holy sh...

453
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,120
<i>Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...</i>

454
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,880
<i>...will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...</i>

455
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,840
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

456
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,640
We only need five.

457
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

458
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,760
Are you all right, miss?

459
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,480
- My heart. I... I...
- I'm sorry?

460
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,720
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

461
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,120
Please, take me to the hospital.

462
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,200
Take me to the hospital.

463
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,320
Just hold on tight.

464
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,480
Bingo.

465
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,360
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

466
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,240
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

467
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,920
I didn't do anything.

468
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,240
Call me Katherine.

469
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,440
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

470
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,400
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

471
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,960
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

472
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,560
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

473
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,320
Good night.

474
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,960
It's like this on every channel.

475
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,880
<i>He was in Manila at 10:55 P.M.
and then spotted...</i>

476
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,640
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

477
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,600
<i>But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...</i>

478
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,760
<i>...there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.</i>

479
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,040
<i>Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...</i>

480
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,840
<i>Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.</i>

481
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,400
<i>He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.</i>

482
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,840
<i>- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!</i>

483
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,920
<i>- The chief is waiting.
...on every continent, giving citizens...</i>

484
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,200
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

485
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,400
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

486
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,240
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

487
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,920
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

488
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,800
You wanted to see me?

489
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,320
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

490
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,360
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

491
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,400
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

492
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,720
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

493
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,800
Cellphones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

494
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,320
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

495
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,760
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

496
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,440
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

497
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,000
Covered him. You know what I mean.

498
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,240
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

499
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,080
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

500
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,720
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

501
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,520
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

502
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,240
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

503
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,080
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

504
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,320
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

505
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,920
Maybe he's got something to say.

506
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,680
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

507
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,960
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

508
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,280
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

509
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,280
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

510
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,000
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

511
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,720
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

512
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,720
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

513
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,120
Lois, Superman.

514
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,400
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

515
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,120
Great. Thanks, chief.

516
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,760
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

517
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,120
Relationship?

518
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,200
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

519
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,160
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

520
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,960
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

521
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,040
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

522
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,920
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

523
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,920
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

524
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,000
...without bringing him
back into your life.

525
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,280
<i>There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.</i>

526
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,400
<i>We're coming to you from Sydney...</i>

527
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,200
<i>...where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...</i>

528
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,440
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

529
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,080
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

530
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,080
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

531
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,880
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

532
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,040
Pretend. Like we talked about.

533
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,880
You didn't actually have to cut them!

534
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,280
Of course I did.

535
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,080
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

536
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,040
So did you get your rock?

537
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,200
I did.

538
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,400
<i>U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.</i>

539
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,320
<i>High-wind advisory is in effect...</i>

540
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,240
<i>...ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.</i>

541
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,480
<i>All warnings lasting
until later this evening.</i>

542
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,840
<i>Security, security.</i>

543
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,240
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.</i>

544
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,680
<i>Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.</i>

545
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,600
<i>Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.</i>

546
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,600
<i>This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.</i>

547
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,280
Weird. If these times are right...

548
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,400
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

549
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,880
Where?

550
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,760
I'm not sure yet.

551
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,960
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

552
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,520
<i>Both.</i>

553
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,800
<i>- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".</i>

554
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,560
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

555
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,560
<i>Anything but lead.</i>

556
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,880
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

557
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,640
...faster than a speeding bullet...

558
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,120
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

559
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,240
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

560
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,640
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

561
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,920
It's deadly. To him.

562
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,560
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

563
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,960
<i>About 6'3", 6'4".</i>

564
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,800
<i>About 200, 215 pounds?</i>

565
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,200
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

566
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,160
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

567
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,400
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

568
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,480
I think they have fries and burgers.

569
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,040
So have you found a place to live yet?

570
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,720
No. I'm still looking.

571
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,840
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

572
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,360
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

573
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,200
Thanks.

574
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,320
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

575
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,280
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

576
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,840
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

577
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,880
I just wasn't expecting you.

578
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,040
With all the press on the plane...

579
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,520
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

580
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,720
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

581
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,200
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

582
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,960
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

583
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,760
So you're here for an interview?

584
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,960
Okay, then.

585
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,600
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

586
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,080
Let's start with the big question.

587
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,640
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

588
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,080
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

589
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,640
It was.

590
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,080
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

591
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,760
...I had to see for myself.

592
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,920
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

593
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,400
Not everyone.

594
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,840
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

595
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,840
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

596
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,400
How could you leave us like that?

597
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,160
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

598
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,080
That's why I wrote it.

599
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,920
The world doesn't need a savior.

600
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,160
And neither do I.

601
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,720
Lois.

602
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,720
Will you come with me?

603
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,920
Why?

604
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,320
There's something I wanna show you.

605
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,040
Please.

606
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,680
I can't be gone long.

607
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,680
You won't be.

608
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,200
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

609
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,560
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

610
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,240
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

611
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,840
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

612
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,920
Maybe Clark's right.

613
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,200
You know, my...

614
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:38,200
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

615
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,240
Not like this.

616
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,800
I forgot how warm you were.

617
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,600
Listen.

618
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,280
What do you hear?

619
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,160
Nothing.

620
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,600
I hear everything.

621
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,440
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

622
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,920
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

623
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,800
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

624
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,480
I'll take you back now.

625
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,720
Richard's a good man.

626
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,120
And you've been gone a long time.

627
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,200
I know.

628
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,040
I...

629
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,960
So will I see you around?

630
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,840
I'm always around.

631
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,720
Good night, Lois.

632
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,640
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

633
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,800
You all right?

634
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,920
Where have you been?

635
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:26,520
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

636
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,040
Tell the truth now.

637
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,440
Were you smoking?

638
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,640
No.

639
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,240
Is this real?

640
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,040
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

641
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,880
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

642
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,360
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

643
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,920
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

644
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,160
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

645
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,720
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

646
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,800
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

647
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,400
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

648
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,920
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

649
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,880
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

650
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,040
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

651
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,200
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

652
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,800
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

653
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,080
Department of Water and Power, please.

654
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,000
7782, great.

655
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,840
Metropolis Public Works.

656
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,400
<i>Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?</i>

657
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,160
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

658
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,880
<i>Yeah, I do have it here, actually.</i>

659
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,880
<i>So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.</i>

660
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,480
Which grid was hit first?

661
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,920
<i>It just reads Vanderworth.</i>

662
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,360
<i>- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.</i>

663
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,680
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

664
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,520
<i>- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?</i>

665
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,920
<i>- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.</i>

666
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,920
Oh, Jason.

667
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,520
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

668
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,120
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

669
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,400
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

670
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,400
Can I stay in the car?

671
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,440
No, honey.

672
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,040
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

673
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,920
Hello?

674
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,600
Hello?

675
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,720
I like the curly one.

676
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,440
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

677
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,240
Lex Luthor.

678
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,200
Lois Lane?

679
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,040
You're bald.

680
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,640
And what is your name?

681
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,160
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

682
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,520
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

683
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,760
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

684
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,880
Heck, I'm a fan.

685
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,480
I love your writing...

686
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,040
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

687
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,720
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

688
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,160
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

689
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,760
...for my favorite article of all time, "Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

690
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,680
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

691
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,000
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

692
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,320
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

693
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,880
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

694
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,560
...due process, making your court date.

695
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,080
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

696
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,080
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

697
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,320
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

698
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,560
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

699
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:49,000
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

700
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,040
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

701
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,160
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

702
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,840
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

703
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,720
How about that interview?

704
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,800
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

705
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,600
So, what did the school say?

706
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,200
She picked him up at 3:15.

707
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,440
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

708
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,000
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

709
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,800
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

710
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,160
Excuse me, Clark.

711
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,280
What do you know about crystals?

712
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,080
They make great chandeliers.

713
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:46,440
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

714
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,880
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

715
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,840
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

716
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,480
You're building an island?

717
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,840
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

718
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,200
Let me enlarge it for you.

719
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,960
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

720
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,240
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

721
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,760
Why?

722
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,480
Land, Miss Lane.

723
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,280
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

724
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,800
"You're losing your hair"?

725
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,600
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

726
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,280
He said, "You can print money...

727
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,960
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

728
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,080
...but they'll always need land."

729
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,960
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

730
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,760
But the United States...

731
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,760
Will be underwater.

732
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,680
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

733
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,520
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

734
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,120
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

735
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,400
- They'll...
- They'll...

736
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,280
...what?

737
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,200
I'll have advanced alien technology...

738
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,280
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

739
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,400
Bring it on!

740
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,200
And eventually...

741
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,600
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

742
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,280
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

743
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,680
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

744
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,760
But millions of people will die.

745
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,440
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

746
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,880
This is front-page news.

747
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,440
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

748
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,920
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

749
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,600
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

750
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,640
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

751
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,880
What is that?

752
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,720
I think you know exactly what this is.

753
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,240
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

754
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,040
Mind...

755
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,200
Who is that boy's father?

756
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,440
Richard.

757
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,240
<i>Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.</i>

758
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,320
Are you sure?

759
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,600
<i>Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.</i>

760
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,320
Don't let them leave this room.

761
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,120
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

762
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,520
- Damn it.
- What?

763
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,840
She has a password.

764
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,280
"Jason."

765
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,920
"Richard."

766
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,280
Try "Superman."

767
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,520
"Superman." Great.

768
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
Don't touch that, honey.

769
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,960
Why don't you go play the piano.

770
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,800
Come on, come on, come on.

771
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,400
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

772
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,920
I know.

773
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,440
Come on, come on.

774
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,200
Come on.

775
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,320
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

776
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,400
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

777
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,200
Open this door! Open it!

778
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,200
Could you help Mommy open the door?

779
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,640
I'm sorry.

780
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
It's gonna be okay.

781
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,000
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

782
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,200
We had a little problem downstairs.

783
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,800
Brutus is dead.

784
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,560
He got hit with the piano.

785
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,760
Where's the boy?

786
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,880
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

787
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,040
Oh, it's time for us to go.

788
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,200
My camera's not working.

789
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,000
And my phone's not working.

790
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,480
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

791
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,080
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

792
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,440
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

793
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,360
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

794
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,200
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

795
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,400
That's just off the coast.

796
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,560
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

797
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,040
What are these, lottery numbers?

798
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,480
I think they're coordinates, chief.

799
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,720
Chief...

800
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,720
Come on! Move it!

801
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,200
Chief!

802
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,200
Great Caesar's ghost.

803
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,000
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

804
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,400
How did you get here?

805
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,160
I flew.

806
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,440
Look out!

807
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,400
Mom!

808
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,600
Mom! Mom!

809
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:28,080
Jason, come here! Jason!

810
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,680
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

811
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,440
Mommy! Mom!

812
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,480
Jason!

813
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,240
Jason, hold on!

814
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,800
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

815
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,640
Hold on! Hold on!

816
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,040
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

817
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,720
Mommy!

818
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,160
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

819
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,560
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

820
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,400
Jason, get on my back.

821
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,800
Give me your hand.

822
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:59,120
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

823
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,280
Get buckled in!

824
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,320
She'll be fine.

825
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,280
I can't take off in this.

826
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,240
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

827
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,800
See anything familiar?

828
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,880
I see an old man's sick joke.

829
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,640
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

830
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,720
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

831
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,720
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

832
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:12,080
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

833
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,040
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

834
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,280
...alien.

835
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:22,920
It lacks that human touch.

836
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,360
You have something that belongs to me.

837
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:48,320
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

838
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,000
Do you copy?

839
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,160
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

840
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,560
Do you copy? Damn it!

841
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:00,200
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

842
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,120
Do you copy?

843
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,480
Lois! Are you all right?

844
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,120
Yeah. What happened?

845
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,720
- Superman.
- Where is he?

846
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,360
He went back.

847
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,000
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

848
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,680
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

849
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,320
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

850
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,800
He'll die.

851
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,480
All right, hold on.

852
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,040
Kryptonite.

853
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,840
You're asking yourself, "How?"

854
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,320
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

855
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,040
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

856
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:15,320
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

857
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:20,080
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

858
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:27,560
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

859
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:33,840
I'm still Superman!

860
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:45,400
Get up! Come on!

861
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,600
Now, fly.

862
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,040
So long, Superman.

863
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,360
<i>Your leadership can stir others...</i>

864
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,600
<i>...to their own capacities
for moral betterment.</i>

865
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,600
<i>The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.</i>

866
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,840
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...</i>

867
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,560
<i>...I could embrace you in my arms.</i>

868
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,040
<i>Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.</i>

869
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:41,400
<i>Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.</i>

870
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:54,120
<i>Remember me, Kal-El.</i>

871
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,120
<i>Remember me.</i>

872
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,320
Superman's down there.

873
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,560
- You sure?
- Yeah.

874
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:22,120
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

875
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,400
Lois!

876
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,400
Don't move.

877
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,560
Come on, come on, come on.

878
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,800
Richard!

879
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,280
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

880
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,560
Oh, my God.

881
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,760
How did you find me?

882
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:49,600
Thank you.

883
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,800
What are you doing?

884
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,040
I have to go back.

885
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,320
You're hurt!

886
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,960
Goodbye, Lois.

887
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:35,720
<i>The technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...</i>

888
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:38,120
<i>...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.</i>

889
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,600
<i>Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.</i>

890
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,440
<i>Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...</i>

891
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,480
<i>...would be indistinguishable from magic.</i>

892
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,920
<i>But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...</i>

893
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,480
<i>...entire continents, all grown.</i>

894
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,320
Lex?

895
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:58,080
Are billions of people really going to die?

896
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,960
Yes.

897
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,480
Lex, what's happening?

898
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,760
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

899
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,800
Go! Out, out! Now!

900
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:51,880
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

901
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:55,240
Got it.

902
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:39,080
Here.

903
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,880
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

904
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,560
No!

905
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:27,760
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

906
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,960
Watch it.

907
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,400
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

908
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:24,480
- Move!
- Trauma One.

909
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:28,040
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

910
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,280
Watch it!

911
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,120
Got him!

912
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:48,960
Okay, I think I got it.

913
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,080
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

914
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,480
No hemorrhage.

915
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,240
Shock at 200.

916
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,160
Is that enough? He's not human.

917
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,920
All right, charge to three, 360.

918
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:09,600
Clear!

919
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,240
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

920
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,400
Always be prepared.

921
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,320
How is she?

922
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:08,920
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

923
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,800
- Lois?
- Yeah.

924
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,720
We can leave whenever you're ready.

925
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,400
I mean...

926
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,840
...you don't have to be here.

927
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,760
Where else would I be?

928
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:28,320
<i>Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...</i>

929
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,320
<i>...who have arrived
to show their support.</i>

930
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,200
<i>Many are carrying signs and banners...</i>

931
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:33,720
I could drive.

932
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,240
<i>- no official announcements
over the past few hours...</i>

933
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,880
<i>...but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...</i>

934
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,760
<i>...the Man of Steel lies in a coma...</i>

935
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:45,280
<i>...his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.</i>

936

02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:56,720
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

938
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,640
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

939
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:11,960
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

940
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:15,440
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

941
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:19,080
I wanna go with Mommy.

942
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,000
Taxi.

943
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,560
I'll be right here.

944
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,600
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

945
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,240
This way, Miss Lane.

946
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,400
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

947
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,880
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

948
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,400
I like him.

949
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,600
Me too.

950
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:33,160
I don't know if you can hear me.

951
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:39,040
They say sometimes
that when people are...

952
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,560
That sometimes they can hear you.

953
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:52,760
I don't know if you can hear me.

954
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,840
I wanted to tell you...

955
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,720
Come on, honey.

956
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:42,640
Step back, please!

957
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:02,720
Lex, we only have six of those!

958
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,760
Six?

959
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:13,560
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

960
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:15,960
...and every ounce of your blood...

961
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:20,560
...for a quart of gasoline!

962
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,840
But what will we have to eat?

963
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:55,560
You will be different.

964
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,920
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

965
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,640
But you'll never be alone.

966
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:10,480
You will make my strength your own.

967
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:16,880
You will see my life through your eyes...

968
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:22,880
...as your life will be seen through mine.

969
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,880
The son becomes the father...

970
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:44,080
...and the father becomes the son.

971
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:35,440
Good night!

972
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,240
I...

973
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:56,600
Will we see you?

974
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:00,160
Around?

975
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:04,640
I'm always around.

976
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:11,120
Good night, Lois.

977
02:19:40,000 --> 02:29:00,000
