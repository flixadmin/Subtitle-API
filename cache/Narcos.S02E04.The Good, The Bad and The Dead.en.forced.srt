1
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Tata.

2
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,380
Tata. Where is everyone?

3
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,560
Pablo.

4
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,480
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,860
I'm all right.

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,490
Go back to bed.

7
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,020
Do you know why they brought you there?

8
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,570
He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

9
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,530
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

10
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,280
Colonel Carrillo.

11
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,290
I know this is difficult...

12
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,830
but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

13
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,250
They killed my friend.

14
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,550
- I'm very sorry...
- This is a farce.

15
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,180
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

16
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,800
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

17
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,390
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

18
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,020
Besides, Valeria Velez?

19
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,440
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

20
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,940
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

21
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,200
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

22
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,780
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

23
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,700
They'll assume it's the truth.

24
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,790
Exactly.

25
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,760
What do you propose?

26
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,510
That we don't play Escobar's game.

27
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,010
And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

28
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,980
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

29
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,110
- No. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest--

30
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,530
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

31
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,200
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

32
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,200
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

33
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,790
Of course.

34
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,750
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

35
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,380
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

36
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,050
- Of course.
- Right?

37
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,820
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

38
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,400
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

39
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,120
The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

40
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,500
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

41
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,040
Give me that pencil.

42
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Burn everything.

43
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

44
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,500
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

45
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

46
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,140
Are we having a good time?

47
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,440
That's a very pretty girl.

48
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,530
But you're paying for those lines,
asshole.

49
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,660
Clean this shit up!

50
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,370
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

51
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,920
And wake up, asshole!

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,590
And you, Edgar!

53
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,220
Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

54
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,260
All right. All right.

55
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,720
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

56
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,060
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

57
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,520
What?

58
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,520
- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

59
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,110
Son of a--

60
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,930
Move it, faggot!

61
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,620
Hey there.

62
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,090
Dad?

63
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,800
- Quickly, inside!
- Friend.

64
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,300
Calm down, friend.

65
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,890
Everything is all right.

66
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,100
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

67
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,230
It's carbon rock.

68
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,900
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

69
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,870
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

70
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,950
You're going to put chemists
out of business.

71
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

72
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,330
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

73
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,170
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

74
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,220
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

75
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,140
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

76
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,560
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

77
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,690
Could you take care of that?

78
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,310
Yes, of course.

79
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,610
But don't make it too obvious.

80
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,570
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

81
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,200
Then you should call Pablo

82
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,710
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

83
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,670
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

84
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,890
Guys.

85
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,570
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

86
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,280
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

87
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,860
Ricardo got away.

88
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,780
- When was this?
- Last night.

89
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,830
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

90
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,410
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

91
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,080
Since when do we hide, brother?

92
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,840
Let's trust the boss.

93
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,340
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

94
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,510
- Hello?
- Get me Don Pablo.

95
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,100
- Who is this?
- Fernando Duque.

96
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,480
- Fernando.
- Get him now.

97
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,940
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

98
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,070
Boss?

99
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,910
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

100
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,160
- How many were published?
- Don Pablo,

101
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,880
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

102
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,760
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

103
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,220
Yes. None.

104
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,800
They're very well written.

105
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:38,270
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

106
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,730
This is why we saw ourselves forced

107
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,690
to take up arms and defend ourselves...

108
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,280
Move it, you sons of bitches!

109
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,890
All right. Very good.

110
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,140
Guys.

111
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,810
Ms. Judy.

112
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,690
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

113
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,530
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

114
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,660
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

115
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,910
We know you all joined forces against him.

116
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,920
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

117
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,590
Why? What do you want out of this?

118
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,720
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

119
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,180
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

120
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,640
is also allied with the guerrillas,
who he has helped on many occasions.

121
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,770
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

122
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,820
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

123
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,320
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

124
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,200
- with our military experience--
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

125
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:54,330
No, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

126
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,710
And when this army gets to Medellín,

127
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,670
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

128
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,130
It'll be a matter of weeks.

129
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you say, Pacho?

130
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,220
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

131
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,110
All of this sounds interesting.

132
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,150
With all due respect, gentlemen,

133
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,450
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

134
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,240
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

135
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,620
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

136
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,340
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

137
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,010
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

138
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,850
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

139
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,100
Excuse me.

140
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,080
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

141
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

142
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,460
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

143
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,720
He's back there, looking for you.

144
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,520
If he finds out that I'm here, he's going
to want to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

145
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,520
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.

146
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,940
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

147
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,900
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax!

148
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,950
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

149
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,700
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

150
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,870
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

151
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,040
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

152
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,250
You killed me, Jhon.

153
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,340
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

154
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,930
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

155
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,600
I really am sorry, Maritza.

156
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Believe me. I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

157
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,770
What is it?

158
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,600
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

159
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,150
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

160
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

161
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,950
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

162
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,830
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

163
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,790
Doña Liliana.

164
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,050
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

165
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,590
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

166
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,720
so you can leave with your daughter.

167
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,100
And you? What do you get out of this?

168
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,070
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

169
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm afraid.

170
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,990
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

171
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,870
All right. My turn.

172
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,460
You both look beautiful.

173
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,050
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

174
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,030
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

175
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,160
Velasco told me.

176
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,980
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

177
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,320
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

178
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,740
Let's see.

179
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,780
How do you hold it?

180
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,380
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

181
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,640
It's not a joke, Pablo.

182
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,060
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

183
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,810
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

184
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,030
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

185
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,120
All right.

186
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,960
But I think you need
more practice with that.

187
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,150
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

188
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,740
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

189
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,950
I can't right now. I'm working.

190
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,870
Don't be like that.

191
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,630
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

192
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,500
Hello.

193
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,500
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

194
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,590
- Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

195
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,050
Hello.

196
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,090
Hello.

197
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,970
She's a friend of a friend.

198
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,260
Maritza, meet Javier.

199
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,430
And...

200
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,810
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

201
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,650
She's in trouble.

202
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,400
Just hear her out.

203
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,700
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

204
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,830
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

205
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,620
- Bye!
- No. Wait. It's important.

206
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,000
Please.

207
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,420
Hear her out.

208
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,350
What's your name? Maritza?

209
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,440
What kind of trouble are you in?

210
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,480
Who are you in trouble with?

211
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,240
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

212
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,330
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

213
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,660
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

214
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,590
Why does he want to kill you?

215
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,590
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

216
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,720
And how are you going to do that?

217
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,100
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

218
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,700
If this is true, Colonel, she can tell us
when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

219
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,350
Let's go.

220
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,740
Can you explain this?

221
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,870
A subpoena.

222
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,920
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

223
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,090
You mean your witch hunt.

224
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,840
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

225
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,470
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

226
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,230
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

227
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,560
He must have paid someone off.

228
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,610
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

229
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:33,240
This is about transparency, truth, law.

230
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,660
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

231
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,630
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

232
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,680
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

233
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,390
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

234
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,720
but we're talking about a national crisis.

235
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:05,270
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

236
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,110
Look, sir... I ask you to please trust me.

237
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,450
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

238
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:22,160
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

239
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,210
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

240
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,730
Hello?

241
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,520
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

242
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,310
I spoke with Peña.

243
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,900
Pay attention.

244
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,450
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

245
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,870
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

246
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,160
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

247
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,750
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

248
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,170
But I need you to trust me.

249
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,840
Give me the address.

250
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,720
Write it down.

251
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,060
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

252
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,860
Got it.

253
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,750
...my love. Do it again.

254
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,040
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

255
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,170
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

256
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,010
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

257
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,540
Everything all right, boss?

258
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,310
9th Street. 98-3.

259
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,560
Okay. Got it.

260
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,650
All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

261
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,190
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

262
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,600
Yes, Colonel.

263
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,940
Attention! We're headed out!

264
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,300
We're on San Juan.

265
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,360
Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.

266
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,280
Of course, blondie.

267
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,000
It's burning!

268
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,710
Reverse!

269
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,430
It's an ambush!

270
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,890
Sabada!

271
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,230
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

272
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,400
Son of a bitch!

273
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,170
Look at me.

274
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,010
Look at me.

275
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,190
You asked a child to give me this.

276
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,870
You can have it back.

277
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:13,930
And this... is for my cousin, Gustavo.

278
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,600
Coward.

279
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,180
Son of a bitch.

280
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,550
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

281
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,300
They're saying that Pablo himself
killed Carrillo.

282
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,350
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

283
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,980
Or me, or you, Pacho.

284
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,070
No, we've got to come up
with another plan.

285
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,440
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

286
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,700
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

287
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,620
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

288
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:09,910
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

289
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,790
They want a scapegoat.

290
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,290
And we have to give them one.

291
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,430
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

292
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,850
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

293
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,900
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

294
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,020
when I entered La Catedral.

295
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,900
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

296
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,830
I don't accept your resignation.

297
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,420
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

298
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,000
We have to do it, César.

299
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,760
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

300
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,810
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

301
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,430
And it's not going to be you.

302
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:28,110
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

303
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,500
Good luck.

304
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,620
Limón told me you have a daughter.

305
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,580
How old?

306
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,300
- Two.
- And what's her name?

307
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,140
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

308
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,520
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

309
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:39,330
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

310
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:42,580
Thank you.

311
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:49,420
Know that... you have a friend in me.

312
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,890
What did you do?

313
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,480
I took care of it.

314
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,480
You're safe now.
