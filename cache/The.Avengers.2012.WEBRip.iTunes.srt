1
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,448
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:38,121
It is on a little world, a human world.

3
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,209
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:48,215
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

5
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,845
He is ready to lead

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:58,475
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,521
A world will be his.

8
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,816
The universe, yours.

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:11,613
And the humans,
what can they do but burn?

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,254
All personnel,

11
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,673
the evacuation order
has been confirmed.

12
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,081
How bad is it?

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,376
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,091
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,052
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

16
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,471
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

17
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,639
Spontaneous event.

18
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,723
It just turned itself on?

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,225
Where are the energy levels now?

20
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,602
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

21
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,811
How long to get everyone out?

22
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,563
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

23
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,023
Do better.

24
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,943
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

25
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,361
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

26
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,947
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

27
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,491
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

28
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,659
I need you to make sure

29
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,452
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,663
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

31
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,581
Until such time as the world ends,

32
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,542
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

33
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,086
Clear out the tech below.

34
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,338
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

35
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,923
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,508
With me.

37
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,512
Talk to me, Doctor.

38
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,932
Director.

39
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,809
Is there anything we know for certain?

40
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,228
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

41
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,231
-Is that supposed to be funny?
-No, it's not funny at all.

42
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,734
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,194
I assume you pulled the plug.

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,071
She's an energy source.

45
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,449
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

46
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,659
If she reaches peak level...

47
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,288
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,873
But we don't have the harness.

49
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,040
My calculations are far from complete.

50
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,377
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

51
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,004
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

52
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,756
That can be harmful.

53
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,675
Where's Agent Barton?

54
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,552
The Hawk?

55
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,054
Up in his nest, as usual.

56
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,725
Agent Barton, report.

57
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,768
I gave you this detail

58
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,437
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

59
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,063
Well, I see better from a distance.

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,940
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

61
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,818
Doctor, it's spiking again.

62
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,403
No one's come or gone.

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,238
And Selvig's clean.

64
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,574
No contacts, no IMs.

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,784
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

66
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,288
"At this end"?

67
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:10,375
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

68
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,378
Doors open from both sides.

69
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,589
Not yet.

70
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,535
Sir, please put down the spear.

71
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,909
You have heart.

72
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,233
Please don't.

73
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,985
I still need that.

74
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,904
This doesn't have to get any messier.

75
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,155
Of course it does.

76
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,115
I've come too far for anything else.

77
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,912
I am Loki, of Asgard

78
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,249
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

79
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,917
Loki,

80
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,710
brother of Thor.

81
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,046
We have no quarrel with your people.

82
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,216
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

83
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,593
Are you planning to step on us?

84
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,180
I come with glad tidings

85
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,100
of a world made free.

86
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,685
Free from what?

87
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,019
Freedom.

88
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,147
Freedom is life's great lie.

89
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,860
Once you accept that, in your heart,

90
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,157
you will know peace.

91
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,202
Yeah, you say "peace,"

92
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,288
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

93
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,957
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

94
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,542
This place is about to blow

95
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,043
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

96
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,796
He means to bury us.

97
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,131
Like the pharaohs of old.

98
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,383
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,635
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

100
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,970
Well, then.

101
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,820
I need these vehicles.

102
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,993
-Who's that?
-They didn't tell me.

103
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,581
Hill!

104
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,707
Do you copy?

105
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,210
Barton has turned.

106
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,017
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

107
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,764
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

108
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,283
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

109
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,751
Director?

110
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,503
Director Fury, do you copy?

111
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,172
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

112
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,508
I have men down. Hill?

113
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,094
A lot of men still under.

114
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,012
I don't know how many survivors.

115
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,389
Sound a general call.

116
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,099
I want every living soul
not working rescue

117
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,183
looking for that briefcase.

118
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,351
Roger that.

119
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,896
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

120
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,774
As of right now,

121
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,234
we are at war.

122
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,529
What do we do?

123
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,903
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

124
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,738
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,947
Believe me

126
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,073
this is better.

127
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,951
Who are you working for?

128
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,912
Lermentov, yes?

129
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,540
Does he think

130
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,417
we have to go through him

131
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,419
to move our cargo?

132
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:38,467
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

133
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
Solohob

134
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,096
a bagman, a front.

135
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,728
Your outdated information betrays you.

136
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,899
The famous Black Widow

137
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,905
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

138
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,951
You really think I'm pretty?

139
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,914
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

140
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,793
to move the tanks.

141
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,380
Tell him he is out.

142
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,423
Well...

143
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,886
...you may have to write it down.

144
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,480
It's for her.

145
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,277
You listen carefully

146
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,612
You're at 1-14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

147
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,115
We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.

148
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,076
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block

149
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,245
before you can make the lobby.

150
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,004
-We need you to come in.
-Are you kidding? I'm working.

151
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,338
This takes precedence.

152
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

153
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,092
This moron is giving me everything.

154
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,137
I don't give everything.

155
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,015
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

156
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,057
Natasha...

157
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,144
Barton's been compromised.

158
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,399
Let me put you on hold.

159
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,108
Where is Barton now?

160
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,568
-We don't know.
-But he's alive?

161
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,613
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

162
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,074
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

163
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,410
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

164
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,747
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

165
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,773
Who are you?

166
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,441
Get out!

167
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,069
There is sickness here!

168
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,112
You're a doctor.

169
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,156
My father's not waking up!

170
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,867
He has a fever and he's moaning

171
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,118
but his eyes won't open.

172
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,202
Slow down.

173
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,746
My father...

174
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,417
Like them?

175
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,714
Please.

176
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,202
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

177
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,703
You know, for a man

178
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,079
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

179
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,333
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

180
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,420
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

181
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,839
Then what is it? Yoga?

182
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,594
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

183
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:55,224
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

184
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,059
Just you and me.

185
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,354
And your actress buddy?

186
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,272
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

187
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,191
I did.

188
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,442
Who are you?

189
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,527
Natasha Romanoff.

190
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,448
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

191
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,201
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

192
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,703
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

193
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,123
S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
How did they find me?

195
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,627
We never lost you, Doctor.

196
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,213
We've kept our distance.

197
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,006
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

198
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,174
off your scent.

199
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,801
Why?

200
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,303
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

201
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,805
But now we need you to come in.

202
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,683
What if I say no?

203
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,102
I'll persuade you.

204
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,775
And what if the other guy says no?

205
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,111
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

206
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,572
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

207
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,743
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

208
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,705
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

209
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,667
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

210
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,336
This

211
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,630
is the Tesseract.

212
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,592
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

213
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,597
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

214
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,349
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

215
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,605
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

216
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,733
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

217
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,402
If there was, that's where I'd be.

218
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,238
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

219
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,948
Not that he's told me.

220
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,326
And he tells you everything?

221
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,620
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

222
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,829
He needs me in a cage?

223
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:41,914
No one's going to put you in a...

224
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,789
Stop lying to me!

225
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,671
I'm sorry. That was mean.

226
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,799
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

227
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,970
Why don't we do this the easy way

228
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,430
where you don't use that

229
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:02,309
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

230
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,645
Okay?

231
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,980
Natasha?

232
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,695
Stand down.

233
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,198
We're good here.

234
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,326
"Just you and me."

235
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,331
This is out of line, Director.

236
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,959
You're dealing
with forces you can't control.

237
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,838
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

238
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,841
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

239
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,427
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?

240
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,180
Not Asgard. Loki.

241
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,183
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?

242
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,351
His brother.

243
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,395
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

244
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,688
but he's worlds away.

245
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,690
We can't depend on him to help, either.

246
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,816
It's up to us.

247
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,527
Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.

248
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,862
It was designed for exactly this...

249
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,031
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

250
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,200
We need a response team.

251
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,536
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

252
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,538
This isn't about the Avengers.

253
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,039
We've seen the list.

254
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,458
You're running the world's greatest
covert security network

255
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,210
and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race

256
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,628
to a handful of freaks.

257
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,672
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

258
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,757
We need a response team.

259
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,052
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

260
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:23,307
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

261
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,058
You believe?

262
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,562
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

263
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,900
No, it's won by soldiers.

264
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,879
There's not enough time.

265
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,756
I got to put her in the water!

266
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,095
You won't be alone.

267
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,097
Oh, my God.

268
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,933
This guy is still alive!

269
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,709
Trouble sleeping?

270
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,463
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

271
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,885
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

272
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,853
When I went under,
the world was at war.

273
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,563
I wake up, they say we won.

274
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,815
They didn't say what we lost.

275
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,776
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

276
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,820
Some, very recently.

277
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,906
Are you here with a mission, sir?

278
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,032
I am.

279
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,534
Trying to get me back in the world?

280
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,703
Trying to save it.

281
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,668
HYDRA's secret weapon.

282
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,628
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

283
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:17,880
when he was looking for you.

284
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,048
He thought what we think.

285
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,469
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

286
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,807
That's something
the world sorely needs.

287
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,768
Who took it from you?

288
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,395
He's called Loki.

289
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,856
He's not from around here.

290
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,775
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

291
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,110
if you're in.

292
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,738
The world has gotten even stranger

293
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:43,989
than you already know.

294
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,075
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

295
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,369
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

296
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,789
There's a debriefing packet

297
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,292
waiting for you back at your apartment.

298
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,421
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

299
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:00,923
that we ought to know now?

300
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,550
You should have left it in the ocean.

301
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,127
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

302
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,671
You disconnected
the transmission lines?

303
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,839
Are we off the grid?

304
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,091
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

305
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,551
of self-sustaining clean energy.

306
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,928
Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over

307
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,263
and it actually works.

308
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,889
I assume.

309
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,099
Light her up.

310
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:58,939
How does it look?

311
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,775
Like Christmas, but with more me.

312
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,610
We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.

313
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,736
You need to do some press.

314
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,405
I'm in DC tomorrow,

315
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,990
I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.

316
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,284
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

317
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,952
Enjoy the moment.

318
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,036
Get in here and I will.

319
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,543
Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

320
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,128
I'm not in.

321
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,130
I'm actually out.

322
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,973
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

323
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,601
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

324
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,400
Levels are holding steady, I think.

325
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,777
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

326
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,154
Which brings me to my next question.

327
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,323
How does it feel to be a genius?

328
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,742
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

329
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:56,455
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

330
00:24:56,622 --> 00:25:00,000
No, all this came from that.

331
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,586
Give yourself some credit. Please.

332
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,796
Stark Tower is your baby.

333
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,090
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

334
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,717
12%?

335
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,052
An argument can be made for 15.

336
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,929
12%? My baby?

337
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,764
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

338
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,349
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

339
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,268
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

340
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,853
That was on you.

341
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,897
-My private elevator...
-You mean our elevator?

342
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,942
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

343
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,528
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

344
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,321
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

345
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,365
It's not going to be that subtle.

346
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,824
I'll tell you what.

347
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,285
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

348
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,828
On the lease.

349
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,123
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

350
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,583
Sir, the telephone.

351
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,211
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.

352
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,088
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

353
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,757
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

354
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,051
-Please leave a message.
-This is urgent.

355
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,178
Then leave it urgently.

356
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,889
Security breach. It's on you.

357
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,725
-Mr. Stark.
-Phil! Come in.

358
00:25:58,767 --> 00:25:59,768
"Phil"?

359
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,936
I can't stay.

360
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,521
His first name is "Agent."

361
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,273
Come on in. We're celebrating.

362
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,191
Which is why he can't stay.

363
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,569
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

364
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,778
I don't like being handed things.

365
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,238
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

366
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,781
So, let's trade.

367
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,868
Thank you.

368
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,121
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

369
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,205
every other Thursday.

370
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,582
This isn't a consultation.

371
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:22,749
Is this about the Avengers?

372
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,252
Which I know nothing about.

373
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,963
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

374
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,381
And I didn't even qualify.

375
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,465
I didn't know that either.

376
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,802
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

377
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,012
don't play well with others.

378
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,471
That I did know.

379
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,265
This isn't about personality
profiles anymore.

380
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,767
Whatever. Ms. Potts, got a second?

381
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:41,935
Half a mo.

382
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,359
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

383
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,069
I was having 12% of a moment.

384
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,032
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

385
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,201
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

386
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,161
What is all this?

387
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,954
This is

388
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,581
this.

389
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,089
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

390
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,257
Tomorrow.

391
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,801
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

392
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,845
Well, what if I didn't?

393
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,847
-If you didn't?
-Yeah.

394
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,225
You mean when you've finished?

395
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,604
Well, then...

396
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,818
Square deal. Fly safe.

397
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,449
Work hard.

398
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,079
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

399
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:45,040
-I can drop you.
-Fantastic.

400
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,166
I want to hear

401
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,001
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

402
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,336
She moved back to Portland.

403
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,214
What? Boo!

404
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,100
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

405
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,482
So, this Dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

406
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,234
A lot of people were.

407
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,861
You were the world's first superhero.

408
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,531
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

409
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:18,866
Erskine's original formula.

410
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,159
Didn't really go his way, did it?

411
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,287
Not so much.

412
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,039
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

413
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,544
He's like a smart person.

414
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,964
I gotta say,

415
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,550
it's an honor to meet you officially.

416
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,219
I've sort of met you. I mean,

417
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,888
I watched you while you were sleeping.

418
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,225
I mean, I was present

419
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,729
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

420
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,190
You know, it's really just a huge honor

421
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,025
to have you on board this...

422
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,527
I hope I'm the man for the job.

423
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,614
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

424
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,742
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

425
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,410
I had a little design input.

426
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,828
The uniform?

427
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,581
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

428
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,917
old-fashioned?

429
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,836
With everything that's happening

430
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,588
and the things that are about
to come to light,

431
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,051
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

432
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,795
The Chitauri grow restless.

433
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,713
Let them gird themselves.

434
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,465
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

435
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,633
Battle?

436
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,887
Against the meager might of Earth?

437
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,932
Glorious, not lengthy.

438
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,978
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

439
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,397
You question us?

440
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,983
You question him,

441
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,610
he who put the scepter in your hand?

442
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,488
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

443
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,950
when you were cast out, defeated?

444
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,910
I was a king!

445
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,329
The rightful king of Asgard,

446
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,497
betrayed.

447
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,001
Your ambition is little

448
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,837
and born of childish need.

449
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,298
We look beyond the Earth

450
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,217
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

451
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,178
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

452
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:47,890
I don't threaten.

453
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:52,269
But until I open the doors,

454
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:56,106
until your force is mine to command,

455
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,650
you are but words.

456
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:02,821
You will have your war, Asgardian.

457
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,617
If you fail,

458
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:12,039
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

459
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:16,585
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

460
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,088
no crevice where he cannot find you.

461
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,426
You think you know pain?

462
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:30,015
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

463
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:00,546
Stow the captain's gear.

464
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:01,672
Yes, sir.

465
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:06,343
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

466
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,845
-Ma'am.
-Hi.

467
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,012
They need you on the bridge.

468
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,639
They're starting the face-trace.

469
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:11,932
See you there.

470
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:17,521
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

471
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,691
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

472
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,777
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

473
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,195
Trading cards?

474
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,364
They're vintage. He's very proud.

475
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,617
Dr. Banner.

476
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,620
Yeah, hi.

477
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,372
They told me you would be coming.

478
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:36,790
Word is, you can find the Cube.

479
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,751
Is that the only word on me?

480
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,336
Only word I care about.

481
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,550
It must be strange for you, all of this.

482
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,053
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

483
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,806
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

484
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,976
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

485
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,478
Flight crew, secure the deck.

486
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,860
Is this a submarine?

487
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,445
Really?

488
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:10,324
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container?

489
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,727
No, no, this is much worse.

490
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,592
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

491
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,887
Increase collective to 8.0%.

492
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,603
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

493
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,230
Increase output to capacity.

494
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,524
Power plant performing at capacity.

495
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,234
We are clear.

496
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,902
All engines operating.

497
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:33,739
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

498
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,577
-We are at level, sir.
-Good.

499
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,911
Let's vanish.

500
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,246
Engage retro-reflection panels.

501
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,306
Reflection panels engaged.

502
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,474
Gentlemen.

503
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,613
Doctor, thank you for coming.

504
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,825
Thanks for asking nicely.

505
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,453
So, how long am I staying?

506
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,455
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

507
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,748
you're in the wind.

508
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,708
Where are you with that?

509
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,627
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

510
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,711
camera on the planet.

511
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,297
Cell phones, laptops...

512
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:34,134
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

513
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,511
That's still not gonna find them in time.

514
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,678
You have to narrow your field.

515
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,847
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

516
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,974
-How many are there?
-Call every lab you know.

517
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,893
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

518
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,311
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

519
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,606
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

520
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,359
At least we could rule out a few places.

521
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,653
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

522
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,029
Agent Romanoff,

523
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,240
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

524
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,576
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

525
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,162
Put it over there.

526
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,250
Where did you find all these people?

527
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,253
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

528
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,004
Is this the stuff you need?

529
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,172
Yeah, iridium.

530
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,925
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

531
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,760
It's very hard to get hold of.

532
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:18,679
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

533
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,138
Well, I didn't know.

534
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,515
Hey!

535
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,809
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

536
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,311
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

537
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,354
I know.

538
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,982
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

539
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,526
My next target.

540
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:33,610
Tell me what you need.

541
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,157
I need a distraction.

542
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,368
And an eyeball.

543
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,627
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

544
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,795
No, no. It's fine.

545
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,717
It's a vintage set.

546
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,178
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

547
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:02,806
Near mint.

548
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,391
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

549
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,977
We got a hit. A 67% match.

550
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,021
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

551
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,398
Location?

552
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,568
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

553
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:15,903
He's not exactly hiding.

554
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,070
Captain,

555
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,572
you're up.

556
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,354
Kneel before me.

557
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,109
I said

558
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,072
kneel!

559
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:18,043
Is not this simpler?

560
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,798
Is this not your natural state?

561
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,303
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

562
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,889
that you crave subjugation.

563
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:35,227
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

564
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,855
in a mad scramble for power,

565
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,275
for identity.

566
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,280
You were made to be ruled.

567
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,198
In the end,

568
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,742
you will always kneel.

569
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,127
Not to men like you.

570
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,088
There are no men like me.

571
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:06,925
There are always men like you.

572
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,970
Look to your elder, people.

573
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,682
Let him be an example.

574
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,233
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

575
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,653
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

576
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,322
we ended up disagreeing.

577
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,157
The soldier.

578
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,619
The man out of time.

579
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,329
I'm not the one who's out of time.

580
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,335
Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.

581
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,607
Kneel.

582
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,900
Not today!

583
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,237
The guy's all over the place.

584
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,117
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

585
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,178
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

586
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,396
Good move.

587
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,440
Mr. Stark.

588
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,276
Captain.

589
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,118
Is he saying anything?

590
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,286
Not a word.

591
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,663
Just get him here. We're low on time.

592
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,667
I don't like it.

593
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,086
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

594
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,921
I don't remember it being that easy.

595
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,673
This guy packs a wallop.

596
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,468
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

597
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,013
What's your thing, Pilates?

598
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:17,097
What?

599
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,348
It's like calisthenics.

600
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,434
You might have missed
a couple of things

601
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,186
doing time as a Capsicle.

602
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:25,939
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

603
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,817
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

604
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:30,819
Where's this coming from?

605
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,367
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

606
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

607
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,139
What are you doing?

608
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,737
And now there's that guy.

609
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,697
Another Asgardian?

610
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,741
-That guy's a friendly?
-Doesn't matter.

611
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:20,536
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

612
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,454
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

613
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,915
I have a plan. Attack.

614
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,756
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

615
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,091
I don't see how I can.

616
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,760
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

617
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,679
There's only one God, ma'am.

618
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:41,181
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

619
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,865
Where is the Tesseract?

620
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,533
I missed you, too.

621
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,201
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

622
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,203
You should thank me.

623
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,039
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

624
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:08,959
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

625
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,294
to your precious Earth?

626
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:15,799
I thought you dead.

627
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,844
Did you mourn?

628
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,054
We all did. Our father...

629
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,266
Your father.

630
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,271
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

631
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,067
We were raised together.

632
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:36,904
We played together,
we fought together.

633
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,614
Do you remember none of that?

634
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,782
I remember a shadow.

635
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,953
Living in the shade of your greatness.

636
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,665
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

637
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,792
I, who was, and should be, king!

638
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,086
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

639
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,088
for your imagined slights?

640
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,342
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

641
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,055
And you're doing
a marvelous job with that.

642
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,807
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

643
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,726
while you idly fret.

644
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,020
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

645
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,480
You think yourself above them?

646
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:13,857
Well, yes.

647
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,527
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

648
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,445
A throne would suit you ill.

649
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,453
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

650
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:30,916
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

651
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,460
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

652
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:34,753
and when I wield it...

653
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,630
Who showed you this power?

654
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,049
Who controls the would-be king?

655
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,134
-I am a king!
-Not here!

656
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:42,636
You give up the Tesseract!

657
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:45,305
You give up this poisonous dream!

658
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,142
You come home.

659
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,232
I don't have it.

660
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,444
You need the Cube to bring me home.

661
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,530
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

662
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,783
You listen well, brother.

663
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,619
I'm listening.

664
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,463
Do not touch me again.

665
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,299
Then don't take my stuff.

666
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,676
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

667
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:25,554
Shakespeare in the Park?

668
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:30,184
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

669
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,353
This is beyond you, metal man.

670
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,314
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

671
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:39,234
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

672
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,611
stay out of the way.

673
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:43,989
Tourist.

674
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:50,287
Okay.

675
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:23,237
Power at 400% capacity.

676
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,655
How about that?

677
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,300
Hey!

678
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,262
That's enough.

679
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:35,642
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

680
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:38,270
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

681
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,814
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

682
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:41,857
Yeah... No.

683
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,567
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

684
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,487
You want me to put the hammer down?

685
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,767
Are we done, here?

686
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,609
In case it's unclear,

687
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:10,112
if you try to escape,

688
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:13,282
if you so much as scratch that glass,

689
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:26,795
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

690
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:29,756
You get how that works?

691
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:34,428
Ant, boot.

692
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:39,266
It's an impressive cage.

693
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,769
Not built, I think, for me.

694
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,272
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

695
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,941
Oh, I've heard.

696
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:49,818
A mindless beast.

697
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,446
Makes play he's still a man.

698
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,033
How desperate are you,

699
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,328
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?

700
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,622
How desperate am I?

701
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,916
You threaten my world with war.

702
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:06,251
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

703
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:10,255
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

704
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:13,467
You have made me very desperate.

705
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,385
You might not be glad that you did.

706
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:22,142
It burns you to have come so close.

707
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,979
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

708
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,316
unlimited power.

709
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,485
And for what?

710
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,698
A warm light for all mankind to share.

711
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:40,285
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

712
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:48,585
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

713
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,554
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

714
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:00,681
Loki's gonna drag this out.

715
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:04,351
So, Thor, what's his play?

716
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:07,145
He has an army called the Chitauri.

717
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:10,232
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

718
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:12,776
He means to lead them
against your people.

719
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,570
They will win him the Earth,

720
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,488
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

721
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:18,407
An army

722
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,325
from outer space.

723
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:22,911
So, he's building another portal.

724
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:24,371
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

725
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,455
Selvig?

726
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,125
-He's an astrophysicist.
-He's a friend.

727
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,460
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

728
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,087
along with one of ours.

729
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:33,922
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

730
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:35,340
He's not leading an army from here.

731
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,217
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

732
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,261
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

733
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:40,596
You could smell crazy on him.

734
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:42,514
Have care how you speak.

735
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,058
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

736
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,685
And he is my brother.

737
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,770
He killed 80 people in two days.

738
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,731
He's adopted.

739
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,275
I think it's about the mechanics.

740
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,444
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

741
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:56,570
It's a stabilizing agent.

742
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,113
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

743
00:53:58,238 --> 00:53:59,781
I'll fly you to Portland.

744
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:01,575
Keep love alive.

745
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,660
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

746
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,662
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

747
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:09,124
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

748
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:11,585
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

749
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,254
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

750
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:16,924
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

751
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:19,843
That man is playing  Galaga.

752
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,473
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

753
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,643
How does Fury even see these?

754
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,769
He turns.

755
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,938
Sounds exhausting.

756
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,190
The rest of the raw materials,

757
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:36,151
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

758
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:37,778
The only major component
he still needs

759
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:41,448
is a power source
of high-energy density.

760
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:44,743
Something to kick-start the Cube.

761
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,829
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

762
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:48,997
Last night.

763
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,001
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

764
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:54,211
Am I the only one who did the reading?

765
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:57,172
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

766
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:00,133
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

767
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,802
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

768
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:04,221
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

769
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:05,514
the quantum tunneling effect.

770
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:06,890
Well, if he could do that,

771
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:09,476
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

772
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:11,979
Finally, someone who speaks English.

773
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,022
Is that what just happened?

774
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,358
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

775
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,653
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

776
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,655
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

777
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,699
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

778
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,493
Thanks.

779
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,162
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

780
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,664
I was hoping you might join him.

781
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:31,832
I would start with that stick of his.

782
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,166
It may be magical,

783
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,668
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

784
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,671
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

785
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,798
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

786
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,675
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

787
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,510
into his personal flying monkeys.

788
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,387
Monkeys? I do not understand.

789
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,471
I do.

790
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,185
I understood that reference.

791
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,729
Shall we play, Doctor?

792
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:55,522
This way, sir.

793
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,205
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

794
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,165
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

795
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,459
But it's going to take weeks to process.

796
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:16,877
If we bypass their mainframe

797
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,253
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

798
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,548
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

799
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,718
All I packed was a toothbrush.

800
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,387
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

801
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,556
Top ten floors, all R&amp;D.

802
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,391
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

803
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:34,144
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

804
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:36,897
I kind of broke Harlem.

805
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,899
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

806
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,901
No tension, no surprises.

807
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:43,820
-Hey!
-Nothing?

808
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:44,988
Are you nuts?

809
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:46,073
Jury's out.

810
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,533
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

811
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:48,575
What's your secret?

812
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,160
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

813
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,245
Is everything a joke to you?

814
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:52,704
Funny things are.

815
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,706
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

816
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,083
isn't funny.

817
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,125
No offense, Doc.

818
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:58,836
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

819
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:01,797
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

820
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,258
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

821
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,301
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

822
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:07,761
Do you think I'm not?

823
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,848
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

824
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,641
What isn't he telling us?

825
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,268
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

826
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,228
You think Fury's hiding something?

827
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,773
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

828
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,650
His secrets have secrets.

829
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,277
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

830
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:26,947
I just want to finish my work here, and...

831
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:28,615
Doctor?

832
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,582
"A warm light for all mankind."

833
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,625
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

834
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,127
I heard it.

835
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,504
I think that was meant for you.

836
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:46,466
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

837
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:47,551
it was still all over the news.

838
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:49,720
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

839
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:52,181
building in New York?

840
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:56,310
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

841
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,854
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

842
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:00,814
It's just the prototype.

843
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,733
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

844
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,610
That's what he's getting at.

845
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:07,321
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

846
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,323
What are they doing
in the energy business

847
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:10,657
in the first place?

848
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,827
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

849
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:15,913
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

850
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:16,997
I'm sorry. Did you say...

851
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,166
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

852
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,126
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

853
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:22,419
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

854
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:23,504
Blueberry?

855
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:25,297
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

856
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:28,258
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

857
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,219
Historically, not awesome.

858
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,638
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

859
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,348
This is a man who means to start a war

860
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:35,849
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

861
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,645
We have orders.
We should follow them.

862
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,022
Following's not really my style.

863
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,859
And you're all about style, aren't you?

864
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:47,027
Of the people in this room,

865
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:48,737
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

866
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,988
and, B, not of use?

867
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,368
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

868
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:58,163
Just find the Cube.

869
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:13,053
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

870
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,515
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

871
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:19,059
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

872
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:20,936
He does have the jump on us.

873
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,772
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

874
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:25,732
It's going to blow up in his face.

875
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:27,901
And I'm going to be there when it does.

876
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,571
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

877
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:33,824
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

878
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:39,204
You see, I don't get a suit of armor.

879
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:42,666
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

880
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,251
It's a nightmare.

881
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:47,462
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

882
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,590
to crawl its way into my heart.

883
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,758
This stops it.

884
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:54,011
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

885
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:56,930
not just armor.

886
00:59:57,723 --> 01:00:00,017
It's a terrible privilege.

887
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,769
-But you can control it.
-Because I learned how.

888
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:03,854
It's different.

889
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,733
Hey, I read all about your accident.

890
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,986
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

891
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,780
So you're saying that the Hulk...

892
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,367
The other guy saved my life?

893
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:19,036
That's nice.

894
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:23,790
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

895
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,960
I guess we'll find out.

896
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,506
You may not enjoy that.

897
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,591
And you just might.

898
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,193
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

899
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:35,070
we moved Jane Foster.

900
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:37,573
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

901
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:41,243
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

902
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:45,163
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

903
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:46,957
She'll be safe.

904
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:48,542
Thank you.

905
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:52,171
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

906
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,799
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

907
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,050
Erik is a good man.

908
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,177
He talks about you a lot.

909
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,222
You changed his life.

910
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,851
You changed everything around here.

911
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,061
They were better as they were.

912
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:10,772
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

913
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:14,610
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

914
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,570
-Like what?
-Bilge snipe.

915
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:19,406
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

916
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,326
-You don't have those?
-I don't think so.

917
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,328
Well, they are repulsive.

918
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,915
And they trample everything
in their path.

919
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,842
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

920
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,178
and your people paid the price.

921
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,263
And now, again.

922
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,268
In my youth, I courted war.

923
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,064
War hasn't started yet.

924
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,983
You think you could make Loki tell us

925
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,401
where the Tesseract is?

926
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:59,780
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

927
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:04,618
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

928
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,537
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

929
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:10,165
A lot of guys think that

930
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:11,500
until the pain starts.

931
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,587
What are you asking me to do?

932
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:19,132
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

933
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,300
Loki is a prisoner.

934
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,928
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

935
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,346
that wants to be here?

936
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,320
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

937
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:41,989
But you figured I'd come.

938
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,157
After.

939
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:48,662
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

940
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:52,457
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

941
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,918
And I would cooperate.

942
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,045
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

943
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:59,131
I would say I've expanded his mind.

944
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,844
And once you've won,

945
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,679
once you're king of the mountain,

946
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,642
what happens to his mind?

947
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:13,478
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

948
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,398
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

949
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,196
Tell me.

950
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,995
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

951
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:36,335
Well, I made a name for myself.

952
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:39,463
I have a very specific skill set.

953
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,966
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

954
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:47,513
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

955
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,850
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

956
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,228
He made a different call.

957
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:59,233
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

958
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,068
Not let you out.

959
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:03,070
No, but I like this.

960
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:07,282
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

961
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,701
Regimes fall every day.

962
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,120
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

963
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:13,247
Or I was.

964
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,250
And what are you now?

965
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:19,920
It's really not that complicated.

966
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:24,091
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

967
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,426
Can you?

968
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:31,765
Can you wipe out that much red?

969
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:34,434
Dreykov's daughter,

970
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:37,980
São Paulo,

971
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,316
the hospital fire?

972
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,736
Barton told me everything.

973
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:47,656
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

974
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,617
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

975
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:52,077
will change anything?

976
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,872
This is the basest sentimentality.

977
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:57,249
This is a child at prayer.

978
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,458
Pathetic!

979
01:05:59,418 --> 01:06:02,045
You lie and kill

980
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:05,215
in the service of liars and killers.

981
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,305
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

982
01:06:11,555 --> 01:06:14,308
something that makes up
for the horrors.

983
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:17,895
But they are part of you.

984
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:21,565
And they will never go away.

985
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:25,903
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

986
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:28,280
Slowly, intimately,

987
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,824
in every way he knows you fear.

988
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:33,702
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

989
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:37,581
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

990
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:40,501
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

991
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,004
You're a monster.

992
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,674
Oh, no.

993
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,843
You brought the monster.

994
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:54,515
So, Banner.

995
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:56,683
That's your play.

996
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:57,935
What?

997
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:00,562
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

998
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,189
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

999
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,357
Send Thor as well.

1000
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,401
Thank you

1001
01:07:06,652 --> 01:07:08,862
for your cooperation.

1002
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:17,829
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1003
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:20,457
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1004
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,459
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1005
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:23,836
We are. The model's locked

1006
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:25,587
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1007
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:26,964
When we get a hit,

1008
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,549
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1009
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:33,178
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1010
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,263
What is "Phase 2"?

1011
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,476
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1012
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,353
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1013
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,189
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1014
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,566
This does not mean that we're making...

1015
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:46,608
I'm sorry, Nick.

1016
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:49,069
What were you lying?

1017
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,445
I was wrong, Director.

1018
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:51,697
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1019
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:52,739
Did you know about this?

1020
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,741
You want to think about
removing yourself

1021
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:55,951
from this environment, Doctor?

1022
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,911
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1023
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,538
Loki is manipulating you.

1024
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,123
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1025
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,749
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1026
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,084
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1027
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:05,544
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1028
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:07,462
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:11,175
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1030
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:13,051
Because of him.

1031
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:14,928
Me?

1032
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:18,682
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1033
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,977
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1034
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,188
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1035
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:28,024
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1036
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,234
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1037
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:32,487
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1038
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,448
And you're not the only threat.

1039
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:37,618
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1040
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:39,620
that can't be controlled.

1041
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:40,996
Like you controlled the Cube?

1042
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:42,372
Your work with the Tesseract

1043
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:45,082
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1044
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,627
It is a signal to all the realms

1045
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:49,379
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1046
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,589
A higher form?

1047
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,798
You forced our hand.

1048
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,841
We had to come up with something.

1049
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:53,966
A nuclear deterrent.

1050
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:56,136
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1051
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:58,639
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1052
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,849
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1053
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,850
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1054
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:04,102
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1055
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,145
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1056
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:09,149
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1057
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:11,109
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1058
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:12,694
Are you boys really that naïve?

1059
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,696
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1060
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:16,156
Captain America's on threat watch?

1061
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:17,198
We all are.

1062
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,825
Wait, you're on that list?

1063
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:20,493
Are you above or below angry bees?

1064
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:22,703
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1065
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:24,081
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1066
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:26,667
-Show some respect.
-Respect what?

1067
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:37,010
Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.

1068
01:09:37,051 --> 01:09:39,263
I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.

1069
01:09:39,345 --> 01:09:41,473
What is your haul? Over.

1070
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,934
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1071
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,778
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1072
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,446
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1073
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:57,990
I mean, what are we, a team?

1074
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:01,076
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1075
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,870
We're a time bomb.

1076
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,122
You need to step away.

1077
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,082
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1078
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,334
You know damn well why. Back off!

1079
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,670
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1080
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:15,340
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armor.

1081
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:16,758
Take that off, what are you?

1082
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,344
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1083
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:23,348
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1084
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,474
I've seen the footage.

1085
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,727
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1086
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,314
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1087
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,816
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1088
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:34,985
I think I would just cut the wire.

1089
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:40,115
Always a way out.

1090
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,491
You may not be a threat

1091
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,410
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1092
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,121
A hero? Like you?

1093
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,290
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1094
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:51,793
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1095
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:19,863
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1096
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:24,618
You people are so petty and tiny.

1097
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:25,786
Yeah, this is a team.

1098
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:26,954
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1099
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:28,080
Dr. Banner back to his...

1100
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,915
Where? You rented my room.

1101
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:31,875
The cell was just in case...

1102
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,418
In case you needed to kill me.

1103
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,129
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1104
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:42,094
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1105
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:46,515
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1106
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:48,475
So I moved on.

1107
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,144
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1108
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:53,647
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1109
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:54,982
and put everyone here at risk.

1110
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,484
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1111
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,152
You want to know how I stay calm?

1112
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,157
Dr. Banner,

1113
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,410
put down the scepter.

1114
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:16,461
Got it.

1115
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:18,046
Sorry, kids,

1116
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,007
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1117
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:21,175
You located the Tesseract?

1118
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,301
I could get there fastest.

1119
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:24,553
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1120
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:25,971
-You're not going alone.
-You're gonna stop me?

1121
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:27,139
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1122
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:28,515
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1123
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:29,600
Put on the suit.

1124
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:34,021
Oh, my God.

1125
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:50,829
Put on the suit.

1126
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:52,206
Yeah.

1127
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:56,710
All hands to stations.

1128
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:02,549
-Hill!
-External detonation.

1129
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:04,051
Number three engine is down.

1130
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:05,177
We've been hit.

1131
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,470
-Can they get it running?
-Fire in engine three!

1132
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:07,554
Talk to me.

1133
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:09,389
Turbine looks mostly intact

1134
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:11,391
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1135
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:12,893
while we're in the air.

1136
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:15,562
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1137
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,731
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1138
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:19,233
-Stark, you copy that?
-I'm on it.

1139
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:22,736
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section

1140
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:23,904
then get to the armory.

1141
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:25,072
Romanoff?

1142
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,077
We're okay.

1143
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:33,997
We're okay, right?

1144
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,095
-Keep that engine down!
-Yes, sir.

1145
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:49,888
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1146
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,807
-Got it.
-Stay close.

1147
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:55,060
Let's go, Level 4.

1148
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:58,564
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1149
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:08,156
Doctor?

1150
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,118
Bruce?

1151
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:15,205
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1152
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,708
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1153
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:18,792
Are you hurt?

1154
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:24,256
We're going to be okay. All right?

1155
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,467
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1156
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:28,969
You will walk away and never ever...

1157
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:30,846
Your life?

1158
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,322
Bruce.

1159
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:28,695
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1160
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,614
-Take us to the water!
-We're flying blind.

1161
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:32,699
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1162
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:34,368
Is the sun coming up?

1163
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,371
-Yes, sir.
-Then put it on the left.

1164
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:39,206
Get us over water.

1165
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,333
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1166
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:45,212
Thanks.

1167
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:49,716
Stark!

1168
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,096
Stark, I'm here!

1169
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,389
Good.

1170
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,934
Let's see what we've got.

1171
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,644
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1172
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:01,854
back online

1173
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,438
before I can access the rotors,

1174
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:05,107
work on dislodging the debris.

1175
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,236
I need you to get to that
engine control panel

1176
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:13,031
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

1177
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:26,920
What does it look like in there?

1178
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,132
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1179
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,009
Well, you're not wrong.

1180
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:38,784
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1181
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:39,868
Try to think!

1182
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:51,880
Okay, the relays are intact.

1183
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,340
What's our next move?

1184
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:54,716
Even if I clear the rotors,

1185
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,969
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.

1186
01:17:57,177 --> 01:17:58,345
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1187
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,264
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1188
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,599
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1189
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:04,017
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1190
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:05,352
Speak English!

1191
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:07,896
You see that red lever?

1192
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:11,275
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.

1193
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,193
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1194
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:07,497
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1195
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,044
Grenade!

1196
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,519
We've got a perimeter breach!

1197
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:30,687
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1198
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,898
Call-outs at every junction.

1199
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:42,407
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.

1200
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,951
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1201
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,119
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1202
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:48,288
Get his attention.

1203
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:52,835
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1204
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:54,294
Don't get too close.

1205
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:55,462
Copy.

1206
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:08,934
Target acquired.

1207
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,147
Target engaged.

1208
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:27,327
Target angry, target angry!

1209
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:37,981
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1210
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,794
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1211
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:09,429
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1212
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,181
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1213
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,767
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1214
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:16,395
He's headed for the detention level.

1215
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,438
Does anybody copy?

1216
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:21,775
This is Agent Romanoff.

1217
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,360
I copy.

1218
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:28,740
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1219
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,325
Yeah, I noticed.

1220
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:00,439
No!

1221
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:10,574
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1222
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:56,161
The humans think us immortal.

1223
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,789
Should we test that?

1224
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,543
Move away, please.

1225
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,549
You like this?

1226
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:12,719
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1227
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,223
Even I don't know what it does.

1228
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:18,475
Do you want to find out?

1229
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:21,687
No!

1230
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:32,883
Natasha?

1231
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:06,208
You're going to lose.

1232
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,336
Am I?

1233
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:13,257
It's in your nature.

1234
01:26:15,384 --> 01:26:17,803
Your heroes are scattered.

1235
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:21,640
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1236
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:22,975
Where is my disadvantage?

1237
01:26:23,976 --> 01:26:25,811
You lack conviction.

1238
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,813
I don't think I'm...

1239
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:36,321
So, that's what it does.

1240
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:41,493
All hands
to crash stations immediately.

1241
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:09,980
Cap, hit the lever.

1242
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:12,983
I need a minute here!

1243
01:27:13,317 --> 01:27:14,484
Lever

1244
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:15,569
now!

1245
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:28,832
Help!

1246
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:05,827
Sorry, boss.

1247
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:07,454
The god rabbited.

1248
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,289
Just stay awake.

1249
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:10,791
Eyes on me.

1250
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,459
No, I'm clocking out here.

1251
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:13,961
Not an option.

1252
01:28:15,254 --> 01:28:17,256
It's okay, boss.

1253
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:21,260
This was never gonna work

1254
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:22,469
if they didn't have something

1255
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:25,389
to...

1256
01:28:54,585 --> 01:28:56,461
Agent Coulson is down.

1257
01:28:57,796 --> 01:28:59,548
A medical team is on
its way to your location.

1258
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,133
They're here.

1259
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:05,971
They called it.

1260
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:23,864
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1261
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:29,369
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1262
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:34,708
We're dead in the air up here.

1263
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:37,920
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1264
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:40,464
Banner, Thor...

1265
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:43,717
I got nothing for you.

1266
01:29:43,759 --> 01:29:46,720
I lost my one good eye.

1267
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:52,643
Maybe I had that coming.

1268
01:29:56,939 --> 01:29:58,273
Yes,

1269
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:02,778
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1270
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:06,156
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1271
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,326
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1272
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:17,417
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1273
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:22,631
called the Avengers Initiative.

1274
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:25,968
The idea was to bring together a group

1275
01:30:26,051 --> 01:30:28,637
of remarkable people

1276
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:32,266
to see if they could become
something more.

1277
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,604
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1278
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:41,024
to fight the battles that we never could.

1279
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:48,907
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1280
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:52,911
In heroes.

1281
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:02,546
Well,

1282
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:06,091
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1283
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,655
You fell out of the sky.

1284
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,129
Did I hurt anybody?

1285
01:31:44,505 --> 01:31:47,591
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1286
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:51,011
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1287
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:52,888
Lucky.

1288
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:54,348
Or just good aim.

1289
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:56,016
You were awake when you fell.

1290
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:00,145
-You saw?
-The whole thing.

1291
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:01,980
Right through the ceiling.

1292
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:06,318
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1293
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,528
Here.

1294
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:11,114
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1295
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:13,659
to a regular-size feller.

1296
01:32:15,953 --> 01:32:17,287
Thank you.

1297
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,206
Are you an alien?

1298
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:21,041
What?

1299
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,709
From outer space, an alien.

1300
01:32:23,252 --> 01:32:24,294
No.

1301
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,881
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1302
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:41,061
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1303
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:46,692
You know that?

1304
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:49,403
Is that what you know?

1305
01:32:51,822 --> 01:32:54,741
I've got no window.

1306
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:56,743
I have to flush him out.

1307
01:32:57,744 --> 01:32:59,663
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1308
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:01,123
You don't understand.

1309
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,253
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1310
01:33:07,254 --> 01:33:11,508
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1311
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,763
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1312
01:33:18,557 --> 01:33:20,767
You know that I do.

1313
01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:29,276
Why am I back?

1314
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:32,112
How did you get him out?

1315
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:34,907
Cognitive recalibration.

1316
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:37,701
I hit you really hard on the head.

1317
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:38,911
Thanks.

1318
01:33:43,373 --> 01:33:44,958
Natasha...

1319
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:46,710
How many agents did I...

1320
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,337
Don't.

1321
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:50,672
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1322
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:53,133
This is Loki.

1323
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:55,886
This is monsters and magic,

1324
01:33:55,969 --> 01:33:57,304
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1325
01:33:57,471 --> 01:33:59,056
Loki, did he get away?

1326
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:00,140
Yeah.

1327
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:02,809
I don't suppose you know where.

1328
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:04,978
I didn't need to know.

1329
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,813
I didn't ask.

1330
01:34:10,025 --> 01:34:12,277
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1331
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:13,695
Today.

1332
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:15,072
We got to stop him.

1333
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:17,032
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1334
01:34:17,241 --> 01:34:19,076
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1335
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:21,954
Well,

1336
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:25,832
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1337
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,669
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1338
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:32,798
Now you sound like you.

1339
01:34:33,465 --> 01:34:34,967
But you don't.

1340
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:40,013
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1341
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:44,852
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1342
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:48,605
What did Loki do to you?

1343
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,775
He didn't. I just...

1344
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:57,030
Natasha.

1345
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:01,159
I've been compromised.

1346
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:06,081
I got red in my ledger.

1347
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:10,544
I would like to wipe it out.

1348
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,103
Was he married?

1349
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:29,646
No.

1350
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:33,984
There was a cellist, I think.

1351
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:36,987
I'm sorry.

1352
01:35:37,654 --> 01:35:39,072
He seemed like a good man.

1353
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:41,742
He was an idiot.

1354
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,911
Why? For believing?

1355
01:35:44,203 --> 01:35:45,662
For taking on Loki alone.

1356
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,497
He was doing his job.

1357
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:49,917
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1358
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,043
He should have...

1359
01:35:51,418 --> 01:35:52,878
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1360
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:55,297
Right, I've heard that before.

1361
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,590
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1362
01:35:56,882 --> 01:35:58,509
We are not soldiers.

1363
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:04,806
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1364
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:06,350
Neither am I.

1365
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:08,685
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1366
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:10,187
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1367
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,231
and get this done.

1368
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:13,440
Loki needs a power source.

1369
01:36:13,524 --> 01:36:14,525
If we can put together a list...

1370
01:36:14,608 --> 01:36:15,609
He made it personal.

1371
01:36:15,901 --> 01:36:16,944
That's not the point.

1372
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:19,488
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1373
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:21,365
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1374
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:22,783
To tear us apart.

1375
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:24,785
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1376
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:27,371
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1377
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,039
That's what he wants.

1378
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:31,333
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1379
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,626
He wants an audience.

1380
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:35,295
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1381
01:36:35,337 --> 01:36:38,340
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1382
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:41,009
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1383
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:42,719
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1384
01:36:42,803 --> 01:36:46,306
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1385
01:36:48,308 --> 01:36:49,601
Son of a bitch.

1386
01:37:00,487 --> 01:37:01,572
Time to go.

1387
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,532
-Go where?
-I'll tell you on the way.

1388
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:04,741
Can you fly one of those jets?

1389
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:07,578
I can.

1390
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,457
You got a suit?

1391
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:13,667
Yeah.

1392
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,210
Then suit up.

1393
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:44,198
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

1394
01:37:44,364 --> 01:37:46,533
Son, just don't.

1395
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:49,995
Sir.

1396
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:51,038
Agent Hill.

1397
01:37:51,788 --> 01:37:53,373
Those cards,

1398
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:59,546
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1399
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:05,636
They needed the push.

1400
01:38:09,056 --> 01:38:11,183
We have an unauthorized departure
from Bay 6.

1401
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:13,310
They found him.

1402
01:38:14,394 --> 01:38:18,148
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1403
01:38:18,232 --> 01:38:20,317
-I want eyes on everything.
-Yes, sir.

1404
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:35,832
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1405
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:39,753
but the device
is already self-sustaining.

1406
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:42,089
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

1407
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:43,632
It's too late!

1408
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:47,261
She can't stop now.

1409
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:50,639
She wants to show us something!

1410
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:53,016
A new universe.

1411
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:54,434
Okay.

1412
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,819
The barrier is pure energy.

1413
01:39:03,902 --> 01:39:05,529
It's unbreachable.

1414
01:39:05,863 --> 01:39:07,698
Yeah, I got that.

1415
01:39:08,574 --> 01:39:09,616
Plan B.

1416
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:13,203
Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.

1417
01:39:13,287 --> 01:39:15,330
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1418
01:39:35,267 --> 01:39:37,978
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1419
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:41,565
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1420
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:43,192
You should have left
your armor on for that.

1421
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:44,985
Yeah.

1422
01:39:45,027 --> 01:39:46,195
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1423
01:39:46,278 --> 01:39:48,488
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1424
01:39:49,656 --> 01:39:51,825
Would you like a drink?

1425
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:53,076
Stalling me won't change anything.

1426
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:55,537
No, no. Threatening.

1427
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:56,705
No drink? Are you sure?

1428
01:39:57,122 --> 01:39:58,665
I'm having one.

1429
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:03,670
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1430
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:05,589
What have I to fear?

1431
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:07,466
The Avengers.

1432
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:12,179
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1433
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:13,972
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1434
01:40:14,014 --> 01:40:15,599
Yes, I've met them.

1435
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:16,892
Yeah.

1436
01:40:17,184 --> 01:40:18,435
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1437
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:19,561
I'll give you that one.

1438
01:40:19,645 --> 01:40:21,855
But let's do a head count, here.

1439
01:40:21,939 --> 01:40:24,525
Your brother, the demigod,

1440
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:29,571
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1441
01:40:29,863 --> 01:40:33,116
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1442
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,078
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1443
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,540
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1444
01:40:39,623 --> 01:40:40,666
That was the plan.

1445
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:43,168
Not a great plan.

1446
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,337
When they come,

1447
01:40:45,379 --> 01:40:46,880
and they will,

1448
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:48,131
they'll come for you.

1449
01:40:48,215 --> 01:40:49,216
I have an army.

1450
01:40:49,299 --> 01:40:50,384
We have a Hulk.

1451
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:52,553
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1452
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:54,638
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1453
01:40:54,721 --> 01:40:58,475
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1454
01:40:58,851 --> 01:41:00,811
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1455
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:03,021
but it's all on you.

1456
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:05,232
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1457
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:08,277
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1458
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:13,574
How will your friends have time for me

1459
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,242
when they are so busy fighting you?

1460
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:23,709
This usually works.

1461
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:26,670
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1462
01:41:27,004 --> 01:41:28,672
One out of five...

1463
01:41:30,424 --> 01:41:33,385
Jarvis, anytime now.

1464
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:37,890
You will all fall before me.

1465
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:39,183
Deploy!

1466
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:40,559
Deploy!

1467
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:11,089
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

1468
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:13,258
His name was Phil.

1469
01:42:37,157 --> 01:42:38,742
Right.

1470
01:42:38,825 --> 01:42:39,826
Army.

1471
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,775
Loki!

1472
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:55,652
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1473
01:43:55,736 --> 01:43:56,820
You can't.

1474
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,864
There is no stopping it.

1475
01:43:59,156 --> 01:44:00,741
There is only

1476
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:02,075
the war.

1477
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:03,327
So be it.

1478
01:44:25,224 --> 01:44:26,975
Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.

1479
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:29,269
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1480
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:31,104
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1481
01:44:49,456 --> 01:44:50,874
Sir, we have more incoming.

1482
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,459
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1483
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:01,134
-Nat?
-I see him.

1484
01:45:45,804 --> 01:45:48,015
We got to get back up there.

1485
01:46:39,358 --> 01:46:40,776
Stark, are you seeing this?

1486
01:46:41,735 --> 01:46:43,904
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1487
01:46:44,196 --> 01:46:45,572
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1488
01:46:45,697 --> 01:46:46,782
Banner?

1489
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:47,866
Just keep me posted.

1490
01:46:48,408 --> 01:46:50,619
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1491
01:46:53,205 --> 01:46:54,790
Look at this!

1492
01:46:54,873 --> 01:46:55,874
Look around you!

1493
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:00,754
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1494
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:02,756
It's too late.

1495
01:47:04,216 --> 01:47:05,509
It's too late to stop it.

1496
01:47:05,592 --> 01:47:09,096
No. We can, together.

1497
01:47:16,061 --> 01:47:17,813
Sentiment.

1498
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:48,302
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1499
01:47:49,303 --> 01:47:50,304
Loki.

1500
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:03,692
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1501
01:48:09,323 --> 01:48:11,325
We got this. It's good. Go.

1502
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:12,659
Do you think you can hold them off?

1503
01:48:12,701 --> 01:48:13,744
Captain,

1504
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:18,582
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1505
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:47,069
Just like Budapest all over again.

1506
01:48:47,945 --> 01:48:50,197
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1507
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:07,673
It's going to be an hour

1508
01:49:07,714 --> 01:49:09,091
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1509
01:49:09,174 --> 01:49:11,009
National Guard?

1510
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:13,220
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1511
01:49:13,303 --> 01:49:14,304
Do we?

1512
01:49:15,889 --> 01:49:17,140
You need men in these buildings.

1513
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:18,725
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1514
01:49:18,809 --> 01:49:20,060
right into the line of fire.

1515
01:49:20,185 --> 01:49:22,145
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1516
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:23,856
You keep them off the streets.

1517
01:49:23,897 --> 01:49:26,191
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1518
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:28,026
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1519
01:49:42,374 --> 01:49:43,584
I need men in those buildings.

1520
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:45,836
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1521
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:48,213
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1522
01:49:58,849 --> 01:50:00,225
Well, we got its attention.

1523
01:50:00,601 --> 01:50:02,477
What the hell was step two?

1524
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:33,050
What's the story upstairs?

1525
01:50:33,133 --> 01:50:35,093
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1526
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:37,804
Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.

1527
01:50:37,888 --> 01:50:39,598
-How do we do this?
-As a team.

1528
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,807
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1529
01:50:41,183 --> 01:50:42,226
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1530
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:43,310
Save it.

1531
01:50:43,727 --> 01:50:45,187
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1532
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:46,313
and that's what we need.

1533
01:50:46,396 --> 01:50:48,148
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1534
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,776
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1535
01:50:58,492 --> 01:51:02,079
So, this all seems horrible.

1536
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:03,705
I've seen worse.

1537
01:51:04,164 --> 01:51:05,207
Sorry.

1538
01:51:05,415 --> 01:51:07,918
No, we could use a little worse.

1539
01:51:08,335 --> 01:51:10,462
-Stark, we got him.
-Banner?

1540
01:51:10,671 --> 01:51:12,005
Just like you said.

1541
01:51:12,297 --> 01:51:14,883
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1542
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:23,225
I don't see how that's a party.

1543
01:51:31,108 --> 01:51:32,109
Dr. Banner.

1544
01:51:33,944 --> 01:51:35,779
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1545
01:51:36,613 --> 01:51:39,157
That's my secret, Captain.

1546
01:51:40,868 --> 01:51:42,160
I'm always angry.

1547
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:55,257
Hold on!

1548
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:26,747
Send the rest.

1549
01:52:33,504 --> 01:52:34,796
Guys.

1550
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:36,340
Call it, Captain.

1551
01:52:36,423 --> 01:52:37,633
All right, listen up.

1552
01:52:37,716 --> 01:52:40,219
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1553
01:52:40,594 --> 01:52:42,012
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1554
01:52:42,095 --> 01:52:44,014
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1555
01:52:44,097 --> 01:52:45,182
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1556
01:52:45,265 --> 01:52:46,475
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1557
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,227
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1558
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:49,603
-Can you give me a lift?
-Right.

1559
01:52:49,686 --> 01:52:50,812
Better clench up, Legolas.

1560
01:52:54,566 --> 01:52:56,610
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1561
01:52:56,902 --> 01:52:58,028
Slow them down.

1562
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,197
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1563
01:53:02,783 --> 01:53:04,117
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1564
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,327
We keep the fighting here.

1565
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,411
And Hulk...

1566
01:53:09,122 --> 01:53:10,207
Smash.

1567
01:54:04,136 --> 01:54:05,262
Sir.

1568
01:54:06,013 --> 01:54:07,014
The Council is on.

1569
01:54:12,186 --> 01:54:15,189
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1570
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:19,109
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1571
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:21,361
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1572
01:54:21,445 --> 01:54:22,654
So find a tight corner.

1573
01:54:22,863 --> 01:54:24,281
I will roger that.

1574
01:54:47,137 --> 01:54:48,347
Oh, boy.

1575
01:54:55,562 --> 01:54:57,231
Nice call.

1576
01:54:57,314 --> 01:54:58,565
What else you got?

1577
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:01,527
Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.

1578
01:55:01,568 --> 01:55:03,570
And he didn't invite me.

1579
01:55:43,277 --> 01:55:45,279
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1580
01:55:45,362 --> 01:55:46,363
if we don't close that portal.

1581
01:55:46,446 --> 01:55:47,656
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1582
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:50,325
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1583
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:54,121
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1584
01:55:55,163 --> 01:55:56,290
I got a ride.

1585
01:55:57,374 --> 01:55:58,458
I could use a boost, though.

1586
01:56:01,086 --> 01:56:02,129
Are you sure about this?

1587
01:56:02,754 --> 01:56:05,132
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1588
01:56:32,326 --> 01:56:34,077
Okay, turn, turn.

1589
01:56:34,328 --> 01:56:36,079
Less! Less!

1590
01:57:58,745 --> 01:58:01,748
Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.

1591
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:03,625
They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.

1592
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:05,460
I'm on it.

1593
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:27,399
Everyone! Clear out!

1594
01:58:57,429 --> 01:58:59,139
Director Fury,

1595
01:58:59,223 --> 01:59:00,807
the Council has made a decision.

1596
01:59:01,141 --> 01:59:03,936
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

1597
01:59:03,977 --> 01:59:05,646
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1598
01:59:05,729 --> 01:59:07,189
I have elected to ignore it.

1599
01:59:07,272 --> 01:59:10,359
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.

1600
01:59:10,442 --> 01:59:11,485
You scramble that jet...

1601
01:59:11,652 --> 01:59:14,404
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1602
01:59:14,655 --> 01:59:16,823
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1603
01:59:16,907 --> 01:59:18,909
I will not order a nuclear strike

1604
01:59:18,992 --> 01:59:20,327
against a civilian population.

1605
01:59:20,577 --> 01:59:22,788
If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.

1606
01:59:23,121 --> 01:59:25,874
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1607
01:59:29,628 --> 01:59:31,004
You.

1608
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:34,800
Hawkeye!

1609
01:59:35,884 --> 01:59:36,885
Nat, what are you doing?

1610
01:59:37,845 --> 01:59:38,846
A little help?

1611
01:59:44,268 --> 01:59:45,269
I got him.

1612
02:00:11,712 --> 02:00:12,713
Enough!

1613
02:00:13,338 --> 02:00:15,549
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1614
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:18,719
I am a god, you dull creature.

1615
02:00:18,802 --> 02:00:20,345
And I will not be bullied by...

1616
02:00:29,897 --> 02:00:31,773
Puny god.

1617
02:00:40,115 --> 02:00:41,658
The scepter...

1618
02:00:42,743 --> 02:00:44,036
Doctor.

1619
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:48,749
Loki's scepter. The energy.

1620
02:00:48,832 --> 02:00:50,542
The Tesseract can't fight,

1621
02:00:50,584 --> 02:00:52,419
but you can't protect against yourself.

1622
02:00:52,586 --> 02:00:53,629
It's not your fault.

1623
02:00:53,712 --> 02:00:54,796
You didn't know what you were doing.

1624
02:00:58,217 --> 02:01:00,427
Actually, I think I did.

1625
02:01:00,511 --> 02:01:03,514
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1626
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,141
Loki's scepter.

1627
02:01:06,225 --> 02:01:08,852
It may be able to close the portal.

1628
02:01:10,896 --> 02:01:12,773
And I'm looking right at it.

1629
02:01:25,202 --> 02:01:28,705
Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.

1630
02:01:35,504 --> 02:01:38,882
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1631
02:01:38,966 --> 02:01:41,093
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1632
02:02:50,913 --> 02:02:52,789
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1633
02:02:52,873 --> 02:02:54,958
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1634
02:02:55,042 --> 02:02:57,461
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.

1635
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:00,506
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1636
02:03:01,048 --> 02:03:02,883
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1637
02:03:03,217 --> 02:03:04,551
We need to shut it down!

1638
02:03:04,593 --> 02:03:06,595
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

1639
02:03:37,376 --> 02:03:39,586
Stark, do you hear me?

1640
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:41,630
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1641
02:03:42,339 --> 02:03:43,757
How long?

1642
02:03:43,841 --> 02:03:45,968
Three minutes, max.

1643
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:47,511
The payload
will wipe out Midtown.

1644
02:03:47,761 --> 02:03:49,638
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1645
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,640
I just did.

1646
02:04:04,361 --> 02:04:05,779
Package is sent.

1647
02:04:05,946 --> 02:04:08,949
Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1648
02:04:31,847 --> 02:04:34,308
Are you ready for another bout?

1649
02:04:34,725 --> 02:04:35,809
What, are you getting sleepy?

1650
02:04:41,523 --> 02:04:43,317
Right at the crown!

1651
02:04:49,323 --> 02:04:51,158
I can close it.

1652
02:04:51,241 --> 02:04:52,993
Can anybody copy?

1653
02:04:53,076 --> 02:04:54,286
I can shut the portal down.

1654
02:04:54,661 --> 02:04:56,622
-Do it!
-No, wait.

1655
02:04:56,663 --> 02:04:57,873
Stark, these things are still coming.

1656
02:04:57,956 --> 02:04:58,957
I got a nuke coming in.

1657
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:00,918
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1658
02:05:10,886 --> 02:05:12,554
And I know just where to put it.

1659
02:05:19,978 --> 02:05:22,356
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1660
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:23,857
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1661
02:05:23,941 --> 02:05:28,111
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1662
02:05:28,195 --> 02:05:29,947
Might as well.

1663
02:05:32,157 --> 02:05:34,576
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.

1664
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:37,037
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence

1665
02:05:37,246 --> 02:05:38,789
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1666
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:41,375
And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,

1667
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:44,211
I have never seen anything like this.

1668
02:05:44,545 --> 02:05:45,879
We have limited information
on the team

1669
02:05:46,129 --> 02:05:49,716
but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1670
02:07:03,290 --> 02:07:05,125
Come on, Stark.

1671
02:07:11,507 --> 02:07:12,674
Close it.

1672
02:07:32,778 --> 02:07:33,779
Son of a gun.

1673
02:07:38,659 --> 02:07:40,327
He's not slowing down.

1674
02:07:58,345 --> 02:07:59,638
Is he breathing?

1675
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:28,917
What the hell?

1676
02:08:31,837 --> 02:08:34,006
What just happened?

1677
02:08:34,256 --> 02:08:36,383
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1678
02:08:40,637 --> 02:08:42,097
We won.

1679
02:08:44,641 --> 02:08:46,018
All right, yay!

1680
02:08:46,059 --> 02:08:48,103
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1681
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:51,148
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1682
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:53,567
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1683
02:08:54,234 --> 02:08:56,361
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1684
02:08:56,445 --> 02:08:58,197
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1685
02:08:58,739 --> 02:09:00,073
We're not finished yet.

1686
02:09:05,162 --> 02:09:07,080
And then shawarma after.

1687
02:09:28,936 --> 02:09:31,271
If it's all the same to you,

1688
02:09:34,483 --> 02:09:36,193
I'll have that drink now.

1689
02:09:44,076 --> 02:09:46,119
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed

1690
02:09:46,203 --> 02:09:47,996
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1691
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,623
the extraordinary heroics

1692
02:09:49,748 --> 02:09:51,750
of the group known as the Avengers

1693
02:09:51,792 --> 02:09:53,418
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,

1694
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,461
but for celebration.

1695
02:09:54,586 --> 02:09:57,089
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.

1696
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:59,007
That someone is watching over us.

1697
02:09:59,091 --> 02:10:00,342
I love you, Thor!

1698
02:10:00,425 --> 02:10:02,177
And then these guys were like...

1699
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:03,637
And then the air goes...

1700
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,138
And this green guy walks up
and he goes...

1701
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:06,306
I don't know.

1702
02:10:06,348 --> 02:10:08,892
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

1703
02:10:08,976 --> 02:10:12,104
It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.

1704
02:10:12,145 --> 02:10:15,399
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

1705
02:10:15,691 --> 02:10:17,651
These so-called "heroes"

1706
02:10:17,734 --> 02:10:19,111
have to be held responsible

1707
02:10:19,152 --> 02:10:21,405
for the destruction done to this city.

1708
02:10:21,488 --> 02:10:23,657
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1709
02:10:23,699 --> 02:10:26,618
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

1710
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:27,744
Their sudden appearance

1711
02:10:27,828 --> 02:10:29,246
and equally sudden disappearance...

1712
02:10:29,329 --> 02:10:32,165
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1713
02:10:34,168 --> 02:10:37,337
Captain America saved my life.

1714
02:10:39,464 --> 02:10:43,010
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,

1715
02:10:43,051 --> 02:10:44,595
I would just...

1716
02:10:45,345 --> 02:10:47,681
I would want to say thank you.

1717
02:10:50,142 --> 02:10:51,685
Where are the Avengers?

1718
02:10:52,019 --> 02:10:54,188
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1719
02:10:54,271 --> 02:10:56,523
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1720
02:10:56,565 --> 02:10:58,192
And the Tesseract?

1721
02:10:58,275 --> 02:11:00,360
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1722
02:11:00,986 --> 02:11:03,363
Out of our reach.

1723
02:11:03,572 --> 02:11:05,032
That's not your call.

1724
02:11:05,073 --> 02:11:06,116
I didn't make it.

1725
02:11:06,241 --> 02:11:08,327
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1726
02:11:08,619 --> 02:11:10,287
So, you let him take it

1727
02:11:10,537 --> 02:11:12,206
and the war criminal, Loki,

1728
02:11:12,289 --> 02:11:14,082
who should be
answering for his crime.

1729
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:16,502
I think he will be.

1730
02:11:30,224 --> 02:11:32,601
I don't think you understand
what you've started,

1731
02:11:32,976 --> 02:11:35,270
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.

1732
02:11:35,687 --> 02:11:36,730
They're dangerous.

1733
02:11:37,105 --> 02:11:40,609
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

1734
02:11:41,318 --> 02:11:43,654
Every world knows it.

1735
02:11:44,321 --> 02:11:46,281
Was that the point of all this?

1736
02:11:46,573 --> 02:11:48,116
A statement?

1737
02:11:50,994 --> 02:11:52,496
A promise.

1738
02:12:00,963 --> 02:12:02,548
Sir, how does it work now?

1739
02:12:03,841 --> 02:12:05,926
They've gone their separate ways.

1740
02:12:05,968 --> 02:12:08,929
Some, pretty extremely far.

1741
02:12:09,638 --> 02:12:11,640
If we get into a situation like this again,

1742
02:12:11,723 --> 02:12:13,100
what happens then?

1743
02:12:13,141 --> 02:12:14,184
They'll come back.

1744
02:12:15,853 --> 02:12:17,354
Are you really sure about that?

1745
02:12:17,437 --> 02:12:18,438
I am.

1746
02:12:20,315 --> 02:12:21,608
Why?

1747
02:12:22,609 --> 02:12:24,486
Because we'll need them to.

1748
02:15:16,366 --> 02:15:18,911
Humans.

1749
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:24,541
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1750
02:15:25,459 --> 02:15:27,628
They stand.

1751
02:15:28,462 --> 02:15:33,675
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1752
02:15:41,892 --> 02:15:44,811
To challenge them

1753
02:15:44,895 --> 02:15:48,273
is to court death.
