1
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:04,794
- Previously on Gotham...
- It's you. It's really you.

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,145
Oh, no. Somebody help!

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,413
Penguin.

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,015
He killed the librarian.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,418
I don't want to kill him.
I want to destroy him.

6
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:17,987
And you promised them Jerome.

7
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:20,122
They want to see his face.

8
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,091
Behold the Prophet!

9
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:23,492
We are Jerome!

10
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,593
You get the message?

11
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:25,961
We don't work for you no more.

12
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:27,463
I will gut you!

13
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:30,332
- Then Nygma dies.
- They have Ed.

14
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,134
When I was last, you know, alive,

15
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:33,202
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

16
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:34,870
Well, where is my face?

17
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:37,373
What?

18
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:38,440
Oswald.

19
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,042
- Where are you?
- Kane Chemicals.

20
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:42,144
Oswald, hurry. Please?

21
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,214
Tonight, Gotham, there are no rules.

22
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:48,684
And when morning comes,
you, too, shall be...

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,287
reborn.

24
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:53,289
He's at the power
plant across the river.

25
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,138
Get those freaks in the cages!

26
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:10,172
We need to find Jerome.

27
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:12,741
Hey, watch him!

28
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,910
Let go of me!

29
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:16,512
Grab him!

30
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,419
What about you, huh?

31
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:25,154
Do you know where
Jerome is? Where is he?!

32
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,022
Where is he? Look around!

33
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:28,958
He's everywhere!

34
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,426
Incoming!

35
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,660
Get down!

36
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,899
Here.

37
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,301
Tonight... Gotham...

38
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,103
is awakened!

39
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:54,116
Remember, Ed's safety
is all that matters.

40
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:58,187
Whoever took him will pay,
but only once Ed is back.

41
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:00,022
Ed!

42
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:02,124
Edward!

43
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,933
Ed.

44
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,604
Are you all right?

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,072
Tell me you are all right.

46
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,507
I'm fine, Oswald.

47
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,476
Of course you are.

48
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:24,380
Where are they? Who dared
to think they could lay

49
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,382
- their hands on you!
- I'm alone.

50
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,884
Oh, you escaped.

51
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,653
You did. Didn't you, you rascal?

52
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:33,255
Did you bring anyone else?

53
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,357
What? Why? No, uh...

54
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:40,496
Just wondering if I was
gonna have to reload.

55
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,131
I don't understand.

56
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,133
I know.

57
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:46,402
That's been half the fun.

58
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:49,238
I-I'm sorry. I... I...

59
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:51,006
What is happening? I...

60
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,408
You weren't kidnapped?

61
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,443
Not unless you count
kidnapping yourself.

62
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:58,747
Recognize it?

63
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:01,483
Oh, why should you?

64
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,118
I doubt you did the deed yourself.

65
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:06,121
That car belonged to Isabella.

66
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,657
Ed, whatever you've heard...

67
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:11,994
I know it was you, Oswald.

68
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,997
Isabella was my everything,

69
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,432
and you took her from me.

70
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:21,370
And now I've taken everything from you.

71
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,872
Well, almost everything.

72
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:26,542
You still have your life.

73
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:30,479
But that ends tonight.

74
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,481
Attention, all residents,

75
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,516
stay off the streets.

76
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:37,519
A curfew is in effect in Gotham City

77
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,321
until further notice.

78
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:42,991
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

79
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:46,528
If the situation worsens,
we may be forced to step in.

80
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,867
The city will bend
long before it breaks.

81
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:54,203
Give the GCPD a chance.

82
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:58,540
Your faith in him is touching.

83
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,009
And possibly dangerous.

84
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:09,017
We're getting reports of a
riot growing on the west side,

85
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,153
as well as widespread looting uptown.

86
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:13,589
Mobs of cult members have
taken over Anders Parks,

87
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:15,557
Gotham Cathedral, the zoo.

88
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,926
All right, concentrate
units on the west side.

89
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:19,528
Make sure they're issued riot gear.

90
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,164
- Any word on Jerome Valeska?
- Nothing yet.

91
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,734
Let me know as soon as he's spotted.

92
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,402
Right. Got it.

93
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,204
Lights aren't coming
back tonight. Tomorrow,

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,340
- if we're lucky.
- This thing just keeps getting bigger.

95
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,776
It's not just the cult anymore.
Ordinary citizens are taking

96
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:36,678
- Jerome's cue.
- Meanwhile, Cobblepot's MIA.

97
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:39,114
You call down to city hall, and
literally no one's in charge.

98
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,717
Although that might
actually be good news.

99
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:43,352
We need to find Jerome. He's the symbol.

100
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,920
If we can take him out,

101
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,588
maybe we can limit this
to a single bad night.

102
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,257
How the hell are we supposed
to find him out there?!

103
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,858
The city's one giant Dumpster fire.

104
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,227
Jerome said he wanted to
plunge the city into darkness

105
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,062
so people could do
what they want, right?

106
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:56,331
He's not one to miss out on
the fun, so what does he want?

107
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:00,068
A puppy? How the hell should
I know? I didn't talk to him.

108
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:01,904
No, but Lee did.

109
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,539
Yes!

110
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:05,908
But my father appeared to me.

111
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,977
I saw him.

112
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,079
No. You...

113
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,816
saw a man that I met in Indian Hill

114
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,718
that does killer impersonations.

115
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:18,654
You see, Oswald...

116
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,622
How do I put this?

117
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:22,925
Ghosts aren't real!

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
But my father's remains...

119
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,296
You stole them from his grave?

120
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,431
Yup.

121
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry. He's at peace now.

122
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,635
I gently placed his remains

123
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,505
inside a Dumpster behind
a Chinese restaurant.

124
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,609
You were angry. I understand.

125
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:43,912
I even forgive you, but-but
killing me is not the way.

126
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,349
So you admit you killed Isabella?

127
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:50,252
Fine. Is that what you want?

128
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,287
- Yes!
- I confess.

129
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:53,922
I had her killed.

130
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,457
But guess what?

131
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:59,361
You should thank me because we both know

132
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:00,968
what would have happened if I hadn't.

133
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,973
Yes!

134
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:04,499
I could have lived a life
with the woman I loved.

135
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,635
I could have been happy.

136
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,303
No, Ed.

137
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,505
You would have killed her.

138
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,576
Just like you did the other one!

139
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,478
You couldn't have helped it!

140
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:19,982
And afterward, you would
have hated yourself!

141
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,184
Well...

142
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,119
we'll never know, will we?

143
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:26,688
I did it for love.

144
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:31,326
What?

145
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,528
I did it because I love you.

146
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:38,133
- You should know that.
- Shut up!

147
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,570
Love is about sacrifice.

148
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,505
It's about putting someone else's needs

149
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,007
and happiness before your own.

150
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,342
- Ed, please...
- 'Cause the truth is, Oswald,

151
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:50,312
you would sacrifice anyone
to save your own neck.

152
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,914
Even me.

153
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,350
Now, if you'll look above us,

154
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:58,253
you will see a cauldron
of highly corrosive acid,

155
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,857
which is currently being
held in place by this chain.

156
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:07,930
When the ice melts,
the chain comes loose,

157
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,731
the vat of acid tips.

158
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,199
You get the idea.

159
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,101
Ed.

160
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:15,037
Please. No, please.

161
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,838
I can change.

162
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:19,508
Say you're right. Say you're right. I...

163
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,310
The fact that I love you proves that

164
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,245
I can change. Just give me a chance.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,781
You know as well as I
that a man facing death

166
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,182
will say anything to save his skin.

167
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,351
And you won't change...

168
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,287
because you can't.

169
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:36,992
Now, I was going to have
you say hello to Isabella.

170
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,194
But...

171
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,430
I think you... are going...

172
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:42,764
to a very different place.

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Good-bye, Oswald.

174
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:47,803
Ed!

175
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,305
Ed! Ed!

176
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:52,774
Okay, I think that's about all I can do.

177
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,142
Thanks.

178
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,944
How's triage going?

179
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,213
We have a lot of overflow
from Gotham General.

180
00:07:58,248 --> 00:07:59,948
What do you want?

181
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:01,817
When Jerome woke up,
did he say anything?

182
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,485
Just that he wanted his face back.

183
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,387
No. I mean, anything that might indicate

184
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,389
where he was going,
what he was planning.

185
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,790
We were just playing catch-up.

186
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,425
You know, about coming
back to life, the cult.

187
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,060
He asked if you and I
were still together.

188
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,129
I mentioned you killed my
husband on our wedding night,

189
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,764
and he thought that was
hilarious, so that's something

190
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,432
the two of you can bond
over when you find him.

191
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,738
He didn't tell me his plan.

192
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:24,806
He talked about Galavan,
the night he died,

193
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,375
and then he mentioned...

194
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,343
- What?
- Bruce.

195
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,078
He said the last thing he remembers

196
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,613
is that he was gonna kill Bruce Wayne.

197
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,348
Call Alfred, tell him I'm on my way.

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,220
I'll light these candles. Good lad.

199
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,489
I'll nip downstairs and see
if there's any life left

200
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,624
in that old generator.

201
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,663
Who's calling at this hour?

202
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:00,142
Alfred?

203
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:01,643
Shh.

204
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,788
Ooh!

205
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,896
My, my. Hmm.

206
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,898
Look how big you've gotten.

207
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,053
Are you okay?

208
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,421
I'll be fine, Master Bruce.

209
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,189
I'll be fine.

210
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,691
Nice place you got here.

211
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,326
You rent?

212
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,660
What do you want?

213
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,696
Attitude.

214
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,832
Teenagers. Am I right?

215
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,134
Oh, I remember those days.

216
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,071
So many exciting new emotions
floating through you.

217
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:55,375
Wanting to kill everyone you saw. Aw.

218
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:00,347
You. Give me.

219
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,419
You know, I will never
understand rich people's tastes.

220
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,021
It's worthless.

221
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,723
My father found it at a flea market.

222
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,358
I keep it for sentimental reasons.

223
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:14,060
Nice try. Oh, it's got some heft to it.

224
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,062
Expensive, I'm guessing.

225
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,764
- Be such a shame if I...
- Oh! No, don't.

226
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:19,866
Huh.

227
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,937
Tougher than I figured.

228
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:26,406
Anyway...

229
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:29,609
Aah! Bloody hell! I
asked you what you want.

230
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,344
Right. Sorry.

231
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,947
The old noodle's still a
little al dente post-thaw.

232
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:36,349
The reason I'm here
is I'm gonna kill you.

233
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,052
Why?

234
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:42,422
Well, it's the last thing
I remember wanting to do.

235
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,225
It's been nagging at me since I woke up.

236
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,598
The idea of slitting that pretty, pink

237
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,500
throat of yours.

238
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,535
Figure that'd clear the decks.

239
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,970
What do you think, huh?

240
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,040
I remember that night...

241
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,941
When you took over the benefit.

242
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:03,910
You were quite the showman.

243
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:04,978
Thank you.

244
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,379
Always nice to be appreciated.

245
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,814
And you're just going to kill me here?

246
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,117
That's kind of disappointing.

247
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,926
What do you mean?

248
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,428
After all the buildup...

249
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:22,729
You coming back to life,

250
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,397
turning off the lights in Gotham...

251
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,600
Killing me here just
doesn't show a lot of...

252
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:31,004
Flair? Hmm? Style?

253
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,773
Panache? Hmm?

254
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,775
Go on, boy. Spit it out.

255
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,511
- I can take it.
- I'm Bruce Wayne.

256
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,914
- I'm aware.
- I am the ruling elite.

257
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,249
My company is the machine
that keeps the cogs

258
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,652
- of Gotham running.
- Wow.

259
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:47,854
Killing me should mean something!

260
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,789
And you're telling me no
one's going to see it?

261
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:54,961
You're saying I need an audience?

262
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,463
Oh. Look,

263
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,466
I know you're just trying to buy time

264
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,035
so you can escape.

265
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,704
But your point is still valid.

266
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,972
Saddle up, boys!

267
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,440
We're taking this show on the road!

268
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,510
And I know just the spot.

269
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,178
Come on. Uh-uh-uh.

270
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,013
Not you, old chap.

271
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,350
The prince of Gotham deserves
a public death. His butler,

272
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:18,818
not so much. Kill him.

273
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:19,719
- No!
- Bruce!

274
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:25,058
This is what you've been training for.

275
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,695
You're gonna be all right on your own.

276
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:33,032
I will see you again.

277
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,869
You carry on, son. You carry on.

278
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,871
Strangely intimate.

279
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,572
Come on.

280
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,474
Try not to get any blood

281
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,843
on the couch. I might
come back for that.

282
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,745
Help!

283
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,315
Somebody help me! Help!

284
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,090
- Help!
- Hello?

285
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,092
Over here!

286
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:02,529
Oh, oh, thank God.

287
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,831
There's not much time.
Cut me loose! Hurry!

288
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,366
What's that car doing in here?

289
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,667
It doesn't matter. Cut me loose.

290
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,702
You-you look familiar.

291
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,372
Yes. I'm... I happen to
be the mayor of Gotham.

292
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:13,973
So free me,

293
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,875
and I promise there will
be a handsome reward.

294
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,377
Oh, it-it really is you,

295
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,212
the mayor of Gotham in the flesh.

296
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:22,382
Yes! Now stop standing there
and get me out of here.

297
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,418
I don't... I don't
know. What did you do?

298
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:28,521
What? Ah. I'm gonna die here
listening to this moron.

299
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,357
- Just cut the ropes!
- Okay, okay! Okay.

300
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,726
Oh, God.

301
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,364
Hurry!

302
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,887
Fine! Come on then. What
are you waiting for?

303
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:03,790
- You in a rush to die, old man?
- Who's gonna kill him?

304
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,058
- Who's gonna do it?
- I want to do it.

305
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,659
- I'll do it.
- What?

306
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,127
What, you three?

307
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,629
You three left here to take out

308
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,431
the rubbish, were you?

309
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,899
You, Mr. Machine Gun, by the suit

310
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,834
of armor, what, you're gonna
shoot me in the grill, are you?

311
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:17,103
What about you with the
crowbar, by the sofa?

312
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,504
Gonna cave in my skull?!

313
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,441
And how 'bout you, Mr. Machete?

314
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,942
Come on in, sunshine. Don't be shy.

315
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:23,943
Your mother wasn't. Chop-chop.

316
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,312
Who are you talking to, old man?

317
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:27,413
Me!

318
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,201
Where's Bruce?

319
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,802
That lunatic Jerome took him.

320
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,706
No, please. No.

321
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,251
Dance!

322
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,855
Get him! Squash her!

323
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,160
Get the old lady. No, the fat guy.

324
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:48,695
Put your back into it.

325
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,565
Oh...

326
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,271
Well, we're off to a good start.

327
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,741
What do you say, Bruce?

328
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:06,446
Want to have some fun
before the main event?

329
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,709
Bullock's pulling messages
from the tip line.

330
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,037
You said Bruce was able to convince Jerome
to kill him in front of an audience?

331
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,282
Yeah, he was trying to buy
himself some more time.

332
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,251
And I'd be proud if I
wasn't so bloody terrified.

333
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,821
I see it's given way to bedlam again.

334
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,923
Jerome's acolytes

335
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,558
have occupied places all over town.

336
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:34,793
So finding an audience
won't be the issue.

337
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,061
Question is where.

338
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,629
We got 'em.

339
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:40,465
They're in Anders Park,
the cathedral, the zoo.

340
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,368
They've taken over the Hillside
Conservatory, the courthouse,

341
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,170
and the Boardwalk Circus.

342
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,638
Jerome was raised in a circus.

343
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,608
Have a strike force and all
available units meet us there.

344
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,276
I'll put out the call
on the way. Let's roll.

345
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,520
Got to be honest, Bruce,

346
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:05,524
you don't make the
world's funniest clown.

347
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,793
- But...
- Ooh.

348
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,662
We can fix that.

349
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,439
Aw, shut up, you big baby.

350
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,042
Let's turn that frown...

351
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,078
upside-down.

352
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:31,550
Gabe! We have to find
Ed Nygma and kill him!

353
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,086
Gabe, where...

354
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,055
Your monkey's cleared out.

355
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,424
And what's that you
were saying about Nygma?

356
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,628
Looks like we're not the only
ones trying to kill that guy.

357
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,096
Now, where is he?

358
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,998
I'm sorry, what?

359
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,666
Speak up.

360
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,668
What are you doing in my house?

361
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,503
Whatever we want.

362
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,538
You're finished, Oswald.

363
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,073
Now, where's Nygma?

364
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,375
I don't know.

365
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,644
Think.

366
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,345
What?

367
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:01,813
I said think.

368
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,049
Oh, I heard you. I'm just
surprised you knew the word.

369
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,236
Speaking of words, any last ones?

370
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:10,257
Babs said not to kill
him until we have Nygma.

371
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,757
I don't work for Barbara Kean.

372
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,662
Stop pretending that you
are anything but muscle!

373
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,931
Yes, you used to be someone in Gotham,

374
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,433
but those days are past!

375
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,074
Remember when I put a knife

376
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,509
in your mom's back?

377
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,544
That was awful, wasn't it?

378
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,380
Her crying, bleeding out.

379
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,684
You just holding her as she died.

380
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,987
You never did anything about it.

381
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,789
Yet.

382
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,557
Nah.

383
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,193
You had your chance to kill me.

384
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:51,897
Stop turning us against each other.

385
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,435
We're taking him with us.

386
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,037
Oh, if you think I am
going anywhere with you...

387
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,543
You realize you have to carry him now.

388
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,646
Son of a bitch.

389
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,754
Oh, I missed.

390
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,124
Is there a plan for all of this madness?

391
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,561
These people don't want a
plan... They want an excuse.

392
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,665
The mother who dreams
of strangling her child.

393
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,167
The husband who wants to stab his wife.

394
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:32,637
All they want is someone to tell them...

395
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,673
"Do it.

396
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,343
Kill them. It doesn't matter."

397
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,345
It doesn't.

398
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:42,114
Ooh, I love this game!

399
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:44,583
- One, please.
- You, sir.

400
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,917
No, no, no, no.

401
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,020
Please, no, no.

402
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,689
You won't get away with it.

403
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,190
I already did. Now shush.

404
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,494
I need to concentrate.

405
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,928
A few dozen brainwashed maniacs

406
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,030
can't keep the city hostage forever.

407
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,532
Well, duh.

408
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,970
So what's the point?

409
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,805
The point

410
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,409
is that all these people
out here, looting, robbing,

411
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,444
killing,

412
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,781
they're the people who wash your car,

413
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,617
who pour your coffee,
who take out your trash.

414
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:22,054
And what happened the
moment the lights went out?

415
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,823
They showed their true faces.

416
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:28,026
They showed how quickly
they want to open up

417
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:31,963
your rich boy veins and
bathe in your blue blood.

418
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,999
That...

419
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,000
is the point.

420
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,202
That's not true.

421
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,138
There are good people in Gotham.

422
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,144
Like who?

423
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,249
The sheep who lock their doors
and crawl under their beds?

424
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,918
Face it, kid,

425
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,987
Gotham has no heroes.

426
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,930
- No, no, no.
- Hey.

427
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,666
Foul!

428
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,734
He pushed me. Did you see that?

429
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,437
You want to kill someone,
let's get on with it. Come on!

430
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:15,707
You're so boring, Bruce.

431
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:17,876
No!

432
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,581
Huh. Sorry.

433
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,382
Yo.

434
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,120
Ah.

435
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,729
Did that hurt?

436
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,867
Not much.

437
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:44,436
You try.

438
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:54,980
Stop.

439
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,214
Stop.

440
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,150
All right.

441
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,919
Enough dilly-dally.

442
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,554
To the main event.

443
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,636
Where the hell is our backup?

444
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,104
Still two minutes out.

445
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:21,606
Most were waylaid by another
riot on the west side.

446
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,941
Yeah, but we can't wait, mate.

447
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,677
All right, so... we go in,

448
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,145
find Bruce, get him to safety,

449
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,481
then we go after Jerome.

450
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,917
- Ready?
- Not really.

451
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,320
Yeah, we all know why we're here!

452
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,522
Here comes Jerome, everybody!

453
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,006
Hear ye, hear ye, gather round.

454
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:59,377
The show is about to... begin!

455
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,654
Let me hear.

456
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,124
Come on, now.

457
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,995
Shut up!

458
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,966
That's better.

459
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,703
Well, I think we can all agree

460
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,005
tonight was a rousing success.

461
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:32,043
We brought this miserable
city to its knees.

462
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:40,352
So, how to thank the best
darn cult of fanatics

463
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:43,488
a messiah like myself
could ever hope for?

464
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,023
I give you...

465
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,194
Cue!

466
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,463
Oh. Yeah. Yes, yes sir.

467
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:57,802
I give you the climax
of our festivities.

468
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,572
The billionaire prince of Gotham...

469
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,075
Bruuuuce...

470
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,412
Wayne!

471
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:15,287
Well, so what do you say, Bruce?

472
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,056
Shall we end the night with a bang?

473
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,792
Or better yet... a boom?

474
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:38,643
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...

475
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,913
All right.

476
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,750
What's next?

477
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:56,324
Death by a thousand cuts, very poetic.

478
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,859
I like that.

479
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:02,998
Slice!

480
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,769
Nailed it.

481
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:16,411
All right, folks.

482
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:17,846
This is very important.

483
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,080
Whatever you do,

484
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,016
please, definitely try this at home.

485
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:24,319
Preferably on a family member.

486
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:29,224
Giddyup. Whoo, doggie!

487
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,625
Yee-haw!

488
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:37,299
You ready, partner?

489
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:38,567
Oh, good Lord.

490
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:40,268
Strike force just arrived.

491
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:41,703
They're coming in.

492
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,212
Detective Gordon, you're just
in time for the big finish.

493
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:52,614
Nobody move!

494
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,583
Find him.

495
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:04,052
I'll find Jerome.

496
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:11,126
So...

497
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,528
here we are.

498
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,598
I suppose I underestimated you, Barbara.

499
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,166
It's the curse of great beauty.

500
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,768
How did it go?

501
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,637
You put together what
happened to Ed's librarian,

502
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,139
turned him against me.

503
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,775
Honestly, wasn't too hard.

504
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,943
And then, together, you hatched a plan

505
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,280
to destroy everything
I made and kill me?

506
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,815
Pretty much.

507
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,483
And brother,

508
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,786
did you ever take the bait.

509
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:44,559
Well, I hope you're happy
at the head of the table.

510
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:47,028
You know, the table is
more or less littered

511
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,563
with dead old dudes,

512
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:51,366
but, hey, it's a place to grow.

513
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:54,502
And now you got what you want,
you don't need Ed anymore.

514
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,870
Uh-uh.

515
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,408
My, my, it didn't take you
long to turn on each other.

516
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,210
You know, I think of it

517
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:05,680
as a limited partnership
that needs dissolving.

518
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:09,884
So... I help you find Ed...

519
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,820
Hmm. Things go better for me?

520
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:15,356
I don't... you kill me?

521
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,393
That about it?

522
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:20,395
Yeah.

523
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:27,402
Oh, Bruce?

524
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:30,205
Where are you, boy?

525
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,840
Come on out, boy.

526
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,008
I won't hurt ya.

527
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:40,515
Bruce, darling.

528
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:48,289
Oh, Brucie...

529
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:02,737
You ruined my show, Bruce.

530
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:06,307
Hiding is just gonna make things worse.

531
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:11,613
I didn't come here to hide.

532
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:14,282
I wanted you to follow me.

533
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:21,790
You're going to pay
for what you've done.

534
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:33,444
You're going to call Ed,
tell him you're alive,

535
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,346
tell him... Oh, I don't care.

536
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:36,948
But find out where he is.

537
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,283
- Why don't you call him?
- Because he's not stupid.

538
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,752
He knows that now you're no longer

539
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:44,589
the head of the underworld
or anything else,

540
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:46,290
we don't need him anymore.

541
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,159
It is our time to rule.

542
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:52,430
You understand if I feel
compelled to refuse?

543
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:54,599
Give me five minutes.

544
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:57,234
- He won't refuse.
- I'd do it in three.

545
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,297
Why you got to do that? What?

546
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,639
- Cut me down like that in front of people.
- I'm just saying...

547
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,641
Will the two of you shut up?!

548
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:08,679
Give up Nygma, save your own ass.

549
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:11,515
Live to love another day. Hey?

550
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,656
Wow.

551
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,157
What's going on?

552
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,959
You have a weird look on your face.

553
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:24,362
Like, weirder than normal.

554
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:26,330
You're right.

555
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,799
I should want him dead.

556
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:31,636
"Should"?

557
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,804
Oswald...

558
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,241
you loved him, and he betrayed you.

559
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:39,944
Actually, I don't know that I did.

560
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,946
Love him.

561
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,048
- Not really.
- What?

562
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:45,816
Ed was right.

563
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:48,352
I thought I loved him...

564
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:54,558
because he saw me as no
one had since my mother.

565
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:55,926
But I killed Isabelle...

566
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,828
I'm pretty sure her name is Isabella,

567
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,297
but go on.

568
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:06,237
Because I wouldn't share him.

569
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:08,873
Ed said love is sacrifice.

570
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,476
I should have been able to
sacrifice my happiness for his.

571
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:16,881
I couldn't.

572
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,552
But I'm ready now.

573
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:25,856
I won't... call... Ed.

574
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:28,859
I won't let you hurt him!

575
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:31,862
So you'd rather die than give up
the man who tried to kill you?

576
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:34,432
I would!

577
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,033
Isn't that crazy?

578
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:38,636
Yes.

579
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,305
It is.

580
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,907
Guess you're not as smart
as you thought you were.

581
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,341
He didn't give you up after all.

582
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:49,914
You're in this together.

583
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:53,284
- But why?
- Because

584
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,952
I didn't want to just take what

585
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:56,587
you had.

586
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,522
I wanted to take what you believed.

587
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:00,391
I wanted you

588
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:02,793
to die...

589
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:06,263
knowing that you were incapable
of loving another person.

590
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,366
But I can.

591
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,403
I just proved that, right?

592
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,073
Now does that mean I passed?

593
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:19,710
- Ed?
- I...

594
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:23,948
don't know what it means.

595
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,566
I have to tell you...

596
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,935
this is way more fun

597
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,004
than I was expecting.

598
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,913
We make a good team, you and me.

599
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:57,915
You killed Alfred.

600
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,752
Is that what this is about?

601
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,487
Yeesh.

602
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,156
Are all rich kids this close

603
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,324
with their butlers?

604
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,425
Oh!

605
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,629
This is about doing what's right.

606
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,597
You want to be a hero!

607
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,300
Tell you what, buddy...

608
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,302
I'll give you a fighting chance.

609
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:22,473
Let's do this mano y mano,

610
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:25,276
my little conquistador.

611
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,945
Come on.

612
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,549
What kind of hero tackles
someone from behind?

613
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,303
Let it out!

614
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:53,671
That's it.

615
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:55,673
That's it.

616
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,708
That's it.

617
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,143
Let it out.

618
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:26,036
Do it.

619
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,876
Aah!

620
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,773
Alfred!

621
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,312
Bruce!

622
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,818
I thought you were dead.

623
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:17,154
Can't get rid of me that
easily, can you, mate?

624
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:22,192
Oh, come here.

625
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,736
Behind you!

626
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,647
Ow.

627
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,872
Word of Jerome's arrest
is spreading quick.

628
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:02,490
Streets are already quieter.

629
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,124
Soon as the docs reattach his face,

630
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,826
he's off to Arkham.

631
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,495
You wish I would've shot him?

632
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,929
Eh, he'd probably just

633
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,131
- come back from the dead again.
- Probably.

634
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,334
At least you get to say you
punched a man's face off.

635
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,668
That's something, right?

636
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:18,939
Jim?

637
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:19,940
Sorry, what?

638
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:21,642
Come on.

639
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:23,344
Let me buy you breakfast.

640
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,586
Well, got to say...

641
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:34,989
the clown makeup was way more terrifying

642
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:37,491
than the damage
underneath, Master Bruce.

643
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,363
Did I ever tell you that
I don't like clowns?

644
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,300
Well...

645
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,936
in a couple of days,

646
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,938
you'll be back to your old self.

647
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:53,140
I guarantee it.

648
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:55,109
You ready to tell me what happened?

649
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:01,615
When Jerome took me away...

650
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:04,118
I thought they were going to kill you.

651
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,488
Shall I tell you what I thought?

652
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,161
I thought how proud I was of you.

653
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:16,163
Of the man that you've become.

654
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,235
I almost killed him, Alfred.

655
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,137
Ah, but you didn't, now, did you?

656
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:25,139
You controlled your anger.

657
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:31,979
It wasn't just anger.

658
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:34,481
After everything Jerome had done,

659
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:36,450
after all the pain

660
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,819
he caused,

661
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:42,556
the idea of killing him felt...

662
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:44,858
It felt right.

663
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,997
Yes.

664
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:51,999
It felt like justice.

665
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:54,368
There's a very fine line, Master Bruce,

666
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:56,370
between justice...

667
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,871
and vengeance.

668
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,574
I know.

669
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,910
But that doesn't mean there isn't one.

670
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,545
No, it doesn't.

671
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,780
I knew where the line
was tonight, Alfred.

672
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:08,215
I didn't cross it.

673
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:14,788
Well, that's the first rule.

674
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:17,091
What do you mean?

675
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,727
Well, I started training you
so you could defend yourself.

676
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:22,730
Well, we're well past that, aren't we?

677
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:25,799
But what's all this training for?

678
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,801
What are you gonna do with it?

679
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,106
I don't know.

680
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:33,607
Nor do I.

681
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:36,243
But if you keep going,

682
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:38,245
you're gonna need rules.

683
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,082
Rules that you cannot

684
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:44,251
and you will not break,

685
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,620
never mind what the reason,

686
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:49,623
never mind what the circumstance.

687
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,659
I will not kill.

688
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:58,899
Say it again.

689
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:04,071
I will not kill.

690
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,810
Then let's get to work.

691
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,632
Tonight was close.

692
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,372
We could have lost Gotham for good.

693
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,609
Soon, we will act,

694
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,645
and you will be called upon.

695
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:49,983
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

696
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,019
Are you prepared?

697
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,988
Yes. But I still don't understand

698
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:56,990
how I can help save Gotham.

699
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,992
Never fear.

700
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,961
You are only part of the plan.

701
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:04,631
Are you sure about this?

702
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,333
You know what must happen

703
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:07,901
if he refuses.

704
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:09,903
I know.

705
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,905
No one refuses the Court.

706
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:49,610
- Uncle Frank?
- Hello, Jim.

707
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,612
It's been a long time.

708
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,452
Ed... I love you.

709
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:01,255
I know you believe that now.

710
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,091
So you need to listen
to me when I tell you

711
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:07,795
by doing this... it will change you.

712
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,429
I've killed before, Oswald.

713
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:11,865
Not like this.

714
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,067
This won't be a crime of passion

715
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:16,737
or self-preservation.

716
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,072
This will be the cold-blooded murder

717
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:20,874
of someone you love.

718
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,545
I don't love you.

719
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:31,585
You need me, Edward Nygma.

720
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Just as I need you.

721
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:36,056
You cannot have one without the other.

722
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:38,959
You killed Isabella.

723
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:39,993
The point is...

724
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,462
That is the point!

725
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:45,132
You can't talk your way
out of this, Oswald.

726
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,100
I have wanted you to suffer

727
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:48,735
as I've suffered.

728
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,571
You killed her,

729
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:52,906
so you die.

730
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,510
When I met you

731
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,512
you were a nervous,

732
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:00,514
jittery loser.

733
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:04,017
You were nothing.

734
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:06,653
I created Edward Nygma.

735
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:09,122
And I am the only one in the world

736
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:11,792
who truly sees you as you are.

737
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:17,264
Who you can still become.

738
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:21,702
You can't do this.

739
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:28,141
Ed, are you listening to me?

740
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:29,643
I'm listening.

741
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,314
Say something.

742
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,687
I loved her, Oswald.

743
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:44,825
And you killed her.
