1
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:05,000
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- You left me the virus.

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,582
You've got two options.

3
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,055
You can take the virus
and find the strength

4
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:10,818
and get out of there. Or...

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,849
you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

6
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,335
Fish?

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,769
Why are you here?

8
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,939
- I was alive.
- Good-bye, Fish!

9
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,615
Then I was dead.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,380
Let's try subject 13, shall we?

11
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,086
And then, I was alive.

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,631
Impossible.

13
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,733
Nothing...

14
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,624
is impossible.

15
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,300
Things are looking up.

16
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,864
My little Penguin and I will be leaving.

17
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,742
This detonator will trigger the bomb.

18
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,508
Thousands will be
infected with the virus.

19
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,788
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

20
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,594
I won't have him
turn you into a murderer.

21
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,028
No. You will press it!

22
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,122
When you're ready, come and find me.

23
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,447
Oh, my.

24
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,216
What's happening out there?

25
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,611
My money, my savings.

26
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,762
- My savings.
- Excuse me, what?

27
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:44,195
My-my money, my savings.
I want my money, my savings.

28
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,993
- What's your account number?
- My whole life.

29
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,087
My money, my savings.

30
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,305
I want my savings.

31
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:54,288
- My money, my savings.
- Uh, this account was closed

32
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,323
- due to unpaid fees.
- No, my money,

33
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:57,758
my savings, my life.

34
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,192
- You have no money.
- Everything.

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,161
The account is closed.

36
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:04,244
Give me my money now!

37
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,566
Oh, God. Um, security?

38
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:07,901
Hey, what are you...

39
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,376
My money, my savings.

40
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,966
Now!

41
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,713
Hey, I'm paying for this.

42
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,268
Get out!

43
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:27,988
Come here! Come back!

44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,761
Buy our cookies!

46
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,353
Move on.

47
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,210
Killer...

48
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,661
killer...

49
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,885
you're a killer.

50
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,502
Killer...

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,585
Killer...

52
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,559
Killer!

53
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,136
Jim?

54
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,074
You okay?

55
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,919
Fine.

56
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,882
I'm fine, Harvey.

57
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,264
Listen, I hate to do this to you, pal.

58
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,402
But I'm gonna have to ask for your gun.

59
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,866
This virus is tearing the city apart.

60
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:47,090
You need me. I can control this.

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,304
That's why I'm not
asking for your badge.

62
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,699
Some of the guys are talking.

63
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,709
These cops are gonna be watching you
for the smallest sign.

64
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:57,056
Okay? And if you've got a gun,

65
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,313
they'll be double jumpy.

66
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,199
It's for your own protection.

67
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,723
Any word on Lee?

68
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,493
Nada. What happened after the bombing?

69
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,115
A mob of infected
swarmed the clock tower.

70
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,064
- She disappeared in the chaos.
- I don't get it.

71
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,365
She went through all that effort

72
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,868
to get you infected with
the virus and she just bolts?

73
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,503
She saw I was fighting it.

74
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:24,980
She's waiting for me to give over to it.

75
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,743
Prove her wrong.

76
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,300
Where's Bruce?

77
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,017
Detective Gordon.

78
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,314
Alfred.

79
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,402
Has he said anything?

80
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,092
No, no, he just sits there staring.

81
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,041
I need to talk to him, Harvey.

82
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,643
We sure that's not the clone?

83
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,185
No, that's Bruce.

84
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,046
God knows what those
bastards done to him,

85
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:06,560
but he's only brainwashed.

86
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,850
Are you really the best
person to talk to him?

87
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,052
I mean, from what you said, you
killed his mentor or something.

88
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,320
He might be a bit peeved.

89
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,910
Listen, whatever they did to him,
that is Bruce Wayne in there.

90
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:19,227
That boy is stronger than
you can possibly imagine.

91
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,281
I just need to make him remember...

92
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,726
who he is.

93
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,035
As long as he doesn't
leave the precinct.

94
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,704
Harvey, something you need to see.

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,249
An antidote?
Lucius, I could kiss your face.

96
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,351
Before you do that, I don't
actually have the formula.

97
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,239
But there is an antidote?
That's what you're saying?

98
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,185
I was going through the papers

99
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,689
you recovered from
the Owl leader's house.

100
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,324
They suggest that while
Strange was working

101
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,792
to weaponize the Tetch virus,

102
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,870
he was also working
on a parallel project,

103
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,692
tailoring different antiviral
agents to his own ends.

104
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,732
Strange was designing an antidote.

105
00:05:57,768 --> 00:05:59,201
That makes sense.

106
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,835
The Court was careful
to protect its own.

107
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,346
They would want a safeguard.

108
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,773
We need to talk to Strange.

109
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,962
Is he still here or has he been moved?

110
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,642
Uh, well, when you were
buried in the coffin

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,446
and the city was
about to be virus-bombed,

112
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:12,735
some decisions had to be made.

113
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,165
Harvey...

114
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,921
I told Alfred to question Strange.

115
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,564
In exchange for him telling us

116
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,289
where the bombing was
gonna go down, Alfred

117
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,423
let Strange walk. Yes,
I'm blaming it on the butler.

118
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,397
All right. Strange is a weasel.

119
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,517
He'd try to get as far away
from this as possible.

120
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,302
Union Station is shut down.

121
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,404
Downtown train station's our best bet.

122
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,006
Okay. Wait up.

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,518
Harvey?

124
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,006
Lucius, I know what
you're gonna say, all right?

125
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,144
He can handle this.

126
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,872
Hell, Barnes had the virus
for weeks before anyone knew.

127
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,883
What I was going to say:
from all I see here,

128
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,128
Strange's virus is an accelerated
version of the Tetch virus.

129
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,315
Why do you think people
are reacting so quickly?

130
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,979
Gordon isn't going to be able
to fight this for long.

131
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,375
Well, we'll just have to
wait and see, huh?

132
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,533
You keep working on that antidote.

133
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,124
One second, one second,
one ticket at a time.

134
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,477
Go get what's her name.

135
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,878
Sir, excuse me!

136
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,826
Ooh.

137
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,254
Excuse me.

138
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,324
Oh, no.

139
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,894
I think you mean, "Hello, Fish.

140
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,043
I miss you."

141
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,309
And don't worry, sweetheart.

142
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,834
The fun has just begun.

143
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,068
"As the flames of henism

144
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:57,843
licked the very foundation
of its society..."

145
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,680
"...Nero played and sang

146
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,797
'The Destruction of Troy.'"

147
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,565
I will say this about the Court of Owls:

148
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,559
they have style.

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,997
Not to mention they've handed us
the perfect opportunity.

150
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,458
For what?

151
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,700
The city is in total disarray.

152
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:25,570
What better time to consolidate power?

153
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,700
Barbara,

154
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,208
I've told you again and again,

155
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:33,441
I have no interest in running Gotham.

156
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,760
- I only want...
- To kill Penguin. Yes.

157
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,650
I got it the first billion times.

158
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,985
And where is he now? Oh!

159
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,487
That's right, with Fish Mooney.

160
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,789
So we find her.

161
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,291
And then what? You blast through

162
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,627
her army of goons
until you get to Oswald?

163
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,757
You're gonna need muscle, honey.

164
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,194
Which you provide.

165
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,210
Oh, so you expect my help?

166
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,678
But when I need yours,

167
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:02,596
to take advantage of an
opportunity of a lifetime...

168
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:04,768
...nothing.

169
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,249
Baby.

170
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,618
Listen, all I ask

171
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:17,521
is that you use this beautiful

172
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:19,677
big brain of yours

173
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,349
to help me, finally,

174
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,314
get this city under my thumb.

175
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,467
And afterwards,

176
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,471
I will help you
pry Penguin away from Fish.

177
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,330
Deal?

178
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:40,127
I will give you a day.

179
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,184
I thought we were friends.

180
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:51,356
When the Court of Owls calls,
o-one does not refuse.

181
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,840
Still, I'm not upset.

182
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:57,462
I knew when your old
masters summoned you,

183
00:09:57,614 --> 00:10:01,379
it was to cook up some horror,
and here's the thing:

184
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:03,235
I need horror.

185
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,537
They're responsible
for all of this, aren't they?

186
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,858
At the behest of the Court,
I weaponized a virus

187
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:11,170
that releases a person's darkest urges.

188
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:14,162
Thousands have been infected.

189
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,882
So where is this virus?

190
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,718
I know there's more.

191
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,529
It has all been used. Please, I must go.

192
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,559
Don't. You will give me the virus,

193
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,163
you will make me the army you promised,

194
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:35,392
you will do everything I say

195
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:40,005
until this city
is in the palm of my hand.

196
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,388
Are we clear?

197
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:44,599
Yes, madam.

198
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,754
Sorry, folks, this exit's off...

199
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,231
I'll look around for the station cop,

200
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,699
see if he found Strange.

201
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,315
Hello?

202
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,306
Oh, geez. He's right here.

203
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,352
- This is Gordon.
<i>- Hi, Jim.</i>

204
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,992
<i>I was just checking in,
seeing how you're feeling.</i>

205
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,145
<i>Crazy day, huh?</i>

206
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,620
Lee, where are you?

207
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,543
<i>Somewhere very familiar to you.</i>

208
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,784
I know how you're feeling.

209
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,937
All that blood rushing
through your veins,

210
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,062
your heart beating

211
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,118
<i>faster and faster.</i>

212
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,801
Listen to me,

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,965
<i>you need to turn yourself in;
it's not safe.</i>

214
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,090
<i>The infected are being killed
all over the city.</i>

215
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,396
Wow, you're really fighting this, huh?

216
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,065
<i>You know, you don't have to.</i>

217
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,425
<i>The cage is finally open, Jim.</i>

218
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,823
<i>You're free.</i>

219
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,916
- No.
- <i>I thought you loved me.</i>

220
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,652
I thought you wanted us to be together.

221
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,352
Not like this.

222
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,281
<i>Well...</i>

223
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,328
...this is the only way, Jim.

224
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,345
<i>Just listen to the whispers.</i>

225
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,797
<i>Killer.</i>

226
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,004
They'll lead you to me,

227
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:18,121
tell you who you are.

228
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,735
<i>Killer.</i>

229
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,106
That's not who I am.

230
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,236
<i>I wonder what they're saying.</i>

231
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,939
<i>That you like hurting people,
killing people?</i>

232
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,108
<i>Killer.</i>

233
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,498
See how well I know you, Jim.

234
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,295
<i>Now I'm gonna go have some fun.</i>

235
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,053
<i>We'll catch up soon.</i>

236
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,054
Promise.

237
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,751
<i>Killer... killer...</i>

238
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,791
<i>you're a killer.</i>

239
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,801
Jim! Jim.

240
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,370
Someone spotted Strange.

241
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,753
Just don't shoot any
innocent bystanders.

242
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:59,010
Or me. Especially me.

243
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:08,090
- GCPD!
- Don't move!

244
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:10,202
Fish?

245
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,351
What a surprise.

246
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,226
My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.

247
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,895
It's good to see you, too.

248
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,397
We just want Strange. You can walk away.

249
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,894
Yeah. Uh, no.

250
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,736
Fish, I know in your own
sick way, you love this city,

251
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,638
and Gotham is bleeding to death.

252
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,807
We need this dirtbag to fix it.

253
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,008
Enough talking. Hand him over.

254
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,892
He has it.

255
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,454
It's in his eyes.

256
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,356
He has the virus.

257
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,085
Really?

258
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,888
So tell me, James,

259
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,223
what's it feel like?

260
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,791
Like it's taking all my willpower...

261
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,329
not to kill you.

262
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,470
Ooh, my.

263
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,147
Harvey, when you say Hugo
here can save the city,

264
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,382
does that mean there's a...

265
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,772
cure for this virus?

266
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,108
Fish, I swear to God,
if you don't step back,

267
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:05,844
I will shoot you and
these two nimrods right here,

268
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,845
right now!

269
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,014
Hugo, is it true

270
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,774
that you're the only one
that can stop this madness?

271
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,586
Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,979
Obviously, I can't give him up now.

273
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,032
Fine, you had your chance.

274
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:23,895
Oh.

275
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,404
Did you really think that I
would come without backup?

276
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,950
<i>- You're a killer.</i>
- Jim,

277
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,476
- dial it down, buddy.
- Victor,

278
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,813
looks like our little
Detective Gordon is overheating.

279
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,681
Perhaps you should cool him off.

280
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,949
Both of them.

281
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,898
Marvelous.

282
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,834
Just marvelous.

283
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,006
There he is,

284
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:10,739
the real James Gordon.

285
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,262
Nice to meet you, at last.

286
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,168
There we go, Master Bruce.
Two lumps, just how you like it.

287
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,684
You hungry, mate?

288
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,683
Can I whip you up a sandwich?

289
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,040
Anyway, if all goes well,
we should be able to

290
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,152
head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.

291
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,139
Although, I was thinking
that we could go abroad.

292
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,008
We could go to Switzerland.

293
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,929
I mean, we used to go with your
mum and dad this time of year.

294
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,422
Stop it.

295
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,824
Your attempts to elicit
an emotional response

296
00:15:57,872 --> 00:16:01,106
by reminding me of shared memories
is clumsy and pathetic.

297
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,887
The last memory I have is of

298
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:08,481
you killing the best friend
and teacher I ever had.

299
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,873
You mean that old geezer that...

300
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,852
kidnapped you, poisoned your mind,

301
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,180
then tried to turn you
into a mass murderer.

302
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,906
Let me tell you something, Master Bruce:

303
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:23,332
that man lied to you.

304
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,915
Him and his bloody Court of Owls,

305
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,728
they tried to use you,
they tried to manipulate you.

306
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:30,080
You say he was a liar.

307
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,458
How?

308
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,757
By taking away the pain
I've carried for years?

309
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:38,226
By giving me revenge against the people

310
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,664
who killed my mother and father?

311
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,344
That's more than you ever did.

312
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,943
Anyway, the Court of Owls
does not matter.

313
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,281
They merely paved the way
for the one who is to come.

314
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,783
What do you mean?

315
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,574
Who-who's coming?

316
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:07,706
You'll see.

317
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,867
- I should cook him.
- They want him alive.

318
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,322
So I'll just cook part of him.

319
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,400
Oh, no, my dear.

320
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,642
- Let's be calm.
- You don't have that kind of control.

321
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,947
And you do?

322
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,854
In my hands,
this flamethrower is a scalpel.

323
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:27,878
Fine.

324
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,612
We each take a foot.

325
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:32,334
Whoever goes above the ankle loses.

326
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:33,604
You're on.

327
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,779
No. N-No. Stop!

328
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,869
Ms. Mooney! Ms. Mooney!

329
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,533
Mooney's busy.

330
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,096
I'm here now.

331
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,924
Mmm.

332
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,687
Also, I think your children
are angry with you.

333
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,644
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- It's understandable.

334
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:56,769
You made them what they are,

335
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:58,930
then abandoned them.

336
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,947
You are working with Ms. Mooney?

337
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:03,827
We're partners.

338
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,111
But you tried to kill her.

339
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,780
And she forgave me.

340
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,238
I know. Surprised me, too.

341
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,051
But, Mooney is not the old Mooney.

342
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:16,104
She has evolved.

343
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:18,323
And she has a vision for Gotham.

344
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:22,527
She sees a city where
people like myself,

345
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,871
Victor, Bridgit... freaks...

346
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,090
are in charge.

347
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,349
And you are gonna help us achieve that.

348
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:37,497
- I can't.
- Wrong, Professor!

349
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:41,974
This virus is tearing Gotham apart.

350
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,156
That makes your antidote the
most valuable thing in the city.

351
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:49,437
We could demand half of Gotham

352
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,382
and the city council
deliver it to us on a platter.

353
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,061
So, I'm going to ask you once,

354
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:58,063
where is it?

355
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:02,304
If I tell you where the antidote is,

356
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,669
I have nothing.

357
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:07,539
I can't.

358
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,677
You can torture me all you want.

359
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,115
Okay.

360
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,942
What?

361
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:22,764
You know, when I was in Arkham,
I was tortured daily.

362
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:25,820
Oh. Well, that was therapy, Oswald.

363
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,625
Therapy.

364
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,618
And that device you used

365
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,861
to administer the therapy,

366
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,402
remember that?

367
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:38,132
It gave the sensation

368
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:40,768
that your head was being torn open

369
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,739
so that hot lava could be poured
directly into your brain.

370
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,507
Afterwards,

371
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,161
just thinking of it
would make me physically ill.

372
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:56,920
So, naturally, I had to have it.

373
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,258
- Oh!
- One moment, Oswald.

374
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,272
No! All right, all right!

375
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,196
I'll-I'll tell you anything
you need to know.

376
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,047
- I'll tell you where the antidote is.
- I know.

377
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,716
But not just yet, 'kay?

378
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,832
What?

379
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,445
They're not answering at the precinct.
They must be overwhelmed.

380
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,782
Well, we're not shooting our way out.

381
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:33,578
<i>Killer.</i>

382
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,436
Jim, take it easy.

383
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,617
Someone will come!

384
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,725
Yeah, and by then,
Mooney will have gotten Strange

385
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,015
to give her the antidote!

386
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:44,390
We're running out of time!

387
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,415
<i>Killer.</i>

388
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:53,603
<i>Killer. Killer.</i>

389
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,610
<i>Killer!</i>

390
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:12,682
I knew you could do it.

391
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,927
Come on, Jim! Fight it!

392
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:21,365
Fight the damn virus!

393
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:23,395
Not my car. That's my car!

394
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,143
Let me drive.

395
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,654
Alvarez, spread the word,

396
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:32,909
Mayor James has called in
the National Guard.

397
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,604
We don't want any soldiers
getting shot by mistake.

398
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:36,784
Leave me alone.

399
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:39,102
The hell's wrong with you?

400
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:42,188
Alvarez, I'm talking to you.

401
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:45,617
I said leave me alone!

402
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,349
So, I will ask you again.

403
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,146
Who's coming?

404
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,396
I mean, I thought
the man that I dispatched

405
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:59,001
at Wayne Enterprises was the
leader of the Court of Owls.

406
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,308
I want you to leave.

407
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,219
Yeah, well, that ain't
gonna happen, is it, mate?

408
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,758
You can't get rid of me that easy.

409
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,258
You have to remember

410
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:09,107
who you are.

411
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,092
I know who I am. I have a destiny.

412
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,099
Now, you listen to me.

413
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:19,979
That man that wanted you
to detonate that bomb...

414
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:22,370
whatever he promised you...

415
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:25,300
freedom from pain, power... none of it,

416
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:26,956
none of it was real.

417
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,670
I want you to remember what is real.

418
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:31,181
I know what's real!

419
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,541
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.

420
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,283
That's real!

421
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,416
No.

422
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,482
No, that's not real.

423
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,750
What's real

424
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:49,868
is every time that you were sick
when you were a kid...

425
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,251
your mum used to sit up
with you all night

426
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:55,663
and read to you till you
fell asleep. That's real.

427
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:59,781
Or when you were seven and you
took your silly rowing boat out

428
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,796
and you got lost in that storm,

429
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,218
and me and your dad were out,
shouting and screaming,

430
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:05,906
losing our minds.

431
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:09,873
And when your dad found you,
how he cried.

432
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,547
That's real.

433
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:15,816
Yes...

434
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,693
your parents died in that alley
three years ago

435
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:22,538
and maybe that man took away
the pain of that night.

436
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:27,203
But there is no life,
there is no love without pain.

437
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:32,110
He could not touch the love
that your mom and dad gave you,

438
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:35,852
that you still have it in you,
that you still have in here.

439
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:41,491
The same love that I have for you.

440
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,365
I love you, Master Bruce.

441
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:51,451
I would do anything for you.

442
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:53,123
I would die for you.

443
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:56,225
You must...

444
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:58,436
find that love again.

445
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:05,162
Come back to me, Master Bruce.

446
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,118
Thank you very much.

447
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,150
No problem.

448
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:00,500
Excuse me.

449
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,595
Oh, bloody hell.

450
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:17,338
What I'm saying is

451
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,291
if Penguin and Fish have hooked up,

452
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,031
things are gonna get
real bad, real fast.

453
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,106
- You want to run?
- No.

454
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:26,825
I'm saying maybe she takes care
of Barbara and Nygma for us.

455
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,364
I mean, we can even help things along.

456
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,301
Send word to Fish
about where Babs is weak.

457
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,684
This is our shot.

458
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:37,946
I'm not ready.

459
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,337
What the hell is she doing here?

460
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,755
One whiskey. Here you go.

461
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,799
Well, this is a strange day.

462
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,817
Never thought I'd see you in here.

463
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:05,133
Had some time to kill
while my ex sees the light.

464
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:06,954
Figured I'd have a little fun.

465
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,224
Where's Babs?

466
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:12,528
- What do you want with her?
- None of your business, errand boy.

467
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,365
I'm sorry, what did you call me?

468
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,608
I'm sorry, you're not an errand boy.

469
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,003
You're more of a shoeshine boy.

470
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:23,779
They should give you a little stand
in the front, cute little hat.

471
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:26,943
- That's more your speed.
- Right. Out.

472
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:30,712
- Oh.
- Yeah.

473
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:39,844
Oh...

474
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,193
You've got the virus.

475
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,894
Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.

476
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:48,264
Are there any other glaringly
obvious remarks you'd like to make?

477
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,366
How about I cut your lungs out
and show them to you?

478
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,968
Wow, that's incredibly vivid.

479
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,866
I'd like to see you try it.

480
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:58,085
But I'm here for your boss,
the crazy blonde.

481
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:00,108
- She's not my boss.
- Uh-huh.

482
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:03,460
I may have a virus making me
freakishly strong and mildly insane,

483
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,381
but even I know that you were
a sidekick to your brother

484
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,819
and you're a sidekick to Barbara.

485
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:12,068
So, can you send her a message for me?

486
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:13,121
Would you?

487
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:15,791
Your boss...

488
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:18,093
...tell her next time I see her,

489
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:19,862
I'm gonna rip her head
right off her body.

490
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,132
Bye now.

491
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:34,884
- God...
- What, you need help?

492
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,126
<i>It's all criminal activity.</i>

493
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,095
<i>Go back inside.</i>

494
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,876
<i>- Gotham curfew.</i>
- Got him.

495
00:27:58,191 --> 00:27:59,519
<i>Shut down.</i>

496
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:03,108
<i>All individuals must remain indoors.</i>

497
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:07,475
<i>Any activity outdoors
will be considered criminal activity.</i>

498
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:11,755
Clear here.

499
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,013
Let's go, let's go. Clear out.

500
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,620
<i>Remain indoors.</i>

501
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:19,943
He's following directions or something.

502
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,849
I've got to find out
who's controlling him,

503
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,818
who's brainwashed him.

504
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,543
And then what?

505
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,498
I'm gonna kill the bastard.

506
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,714
You two wait here.

507
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,239
Professor, if this is a trap,

508
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:38,740
you will soon find yourself hanging

509
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:40,676
- with the rest of the meat.
- It's no trap.

510
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:44,719
I tested earlier versions of the virus
and the antidote on livestock.

511
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,268
I made sure to set aside
a successful batch.

512
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:50,399
This place gives me the creeps.

513
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:52,078
I like it.

514
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,438
It's concentrated.

515
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,850
Once you dilute it,

516
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,479
there is enough here to cure
every infected person in Gotham.

517
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,986
Hmm.

518
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,383
Oswald,

519
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:29,859
you and I will rule this city together.

520
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,099
Yes.

521
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:32,996
But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.

522
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:34,463
He has to die.

523
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:36,472
Oh, he will.

524
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:41,043
And all those who try
to stand in our way.

525
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:48,653
What's this?

526
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,468
Who's there?

527
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,795
Show yourself.

528
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,279
Who are they?

529
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,099
Don't look at me, I don't know.

530
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,699
Really? That's all you've got?

531
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,110
Hand over the antidote now.

532
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:41,142
I want the Strike Force and
all available units there now.

533
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:42,569
I'm on my way.

534
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,271
Reports of an ice storm and fireball
at an East Side slaughterhouse.

535
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:48,450
- Do you think maybe...
- Just drive the damn car.

536
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,608
Sweet mother mercy.

537
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:43,179
<i>Killer.</i>

538
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,301
You damn fool.

539
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,022
Fish!

540
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,565
Oswald.

541
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,255
It's okay. It's-it's o...
We can, we can get you some help.

542
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,806
No, no, no.

543
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:13,064
I've done this enough times
to know I'm finished.

544
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,940
No. D-Do not say that.

545
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,059
- We-we will get you help.
- Listen to me.

546
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,969
Listen to me.

547
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:26,857
Make this city yours...

548
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:33,100
...or you burn it to the ground.

549
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,854
People call me a monster.

550
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,635
You, Jim Gordon,

551
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,335
you're the mons...

552
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:16,000
You're right. I am a monster.

553
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,114
- GCPD!
- Arrest them!

554
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:24,834
All of them!

555
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,498
Strange...

556
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:31,287
You better tell me that you
can make more of that antidote.

557
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,214
Yes, yes.

558
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:37,409
I just need one thing.

559
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:01,859
How's it hanging?

560
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:09,721
You sure about this?

561
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,711
According to my sources,
Fish Mooney and the GCPD

562
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,408
are scrambling to recover
the antidote to this virus.

563
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:18,535
But Fish is dead.

564
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:21,473
And Hugo Strange,
who designed the antidote,

565
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,260
is setting up a lab in the GCPD,

566
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:28,032
but they are missing one
very, very important element.

567
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:34,377
So, yes, I am sure that this bozo

568
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:35,761
is the key to controlling Gotham.

569
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:37,988
Are you my saviors?

570
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,501
Are you the ones to set me free?

571
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,081
Not exactly.

572
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,187
Let's make Gotham beg.

573
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:05,073
<i>Seek out the Yuyan building.</i>

574
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:07,823
<i>Find the demon's head.</i>

575
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,895
<i>Fulfill your destiny.</i>

576
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,518
Right. Find Bullock,
let him know where we are.

577
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:44,322
I'm gonna follow Bruce.

578
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,426
I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.

579
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,822
You know who I am?

580
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:14,749
Who do you think told
the Sensei to send you here?

581
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,812
He's dead.

582
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:19,515
He was murdered.

583
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:21,889
He died.

584
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,990
But he completed his task.

585
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:30,037
The Court of Owls is destroyed,
Gotham burns, and you...

586
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:31,531
are here.

587
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,516
He told me to complete my training,

588
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,516
to find the demon's head.

589
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,594
You already have, Bruce.

590
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,110
I'm the one you seek.

591
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,933
I'm the demon's head.

592
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:48,616
I am Ra's al Ghul.

593
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,505
Why have you come to me, Bruce?

594
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,013
The Sensei told me to seek you out.

595
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:03,252
That you would complete my training.

596
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:06,796
And did the Sensei tell you
who I am, what I seek?

597
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:10,038
I know you are not a part
of the Court of Owls,

598
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,974
that you only used them.
But I don't know why.

599
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:18,059
Then know that I have been alive
more years than you can imagine.

600
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,387
That I have seen and done things

601
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:23,520
that would shake the core
of everything you believe.

602
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:27,075
That I'm thought to be a demon...

603
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:29,751
a saint...

604
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,360
a ghost.

605
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,877
But for all my years, all my travels,

606
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:40,350
there is one thing
that I have never found:

607
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:43,250
a true heir.

608
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:45,776
But I need to know if you're ready.

609
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,855
I am.

610
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,090
The Sensei trained me.

611
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,784
Are you?

612
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,196
He set you a task.

613
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:58,156
He asked you to be the one
that released the virus

614
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,953
that now envelops this city.

615
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,680
You failed.

616
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:04,271
I would have. But...

617
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:07,377
but Alfred, he distracted me.

618
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,002
I know.

619
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,184
I know.

620
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,448
And that's why I'm gonna
give you another chance

621
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:16,176
to complete your journey.

622
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:27,394
Oh, don't look so surprised,
Master Bruce.

623
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,047
I told you you couldn't
get rid of me that easy.

624
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,727
Just got a bit sloppy.
Got a bit of ring rust.

625
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:36,203
Let these little ninja monkeys
get one over on me.

626
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,663
You all right, mate?

627
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,442
What you come as?

628
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,684
Enough.

629
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,490
This man...

630
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:59,522
is your past, Bruce.

631
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,718
Now, embrace your future.

632
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:10,621
Kill him.

633
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,080
Join me.

634
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:24,818
Fulfill your destiny.

635
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:33,466
He's wrong.

636
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,996
Master Bruce,
there's no other way to put it.

637
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,076
He's wrong.

638
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:42,114
Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.

639
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:45,856
And one day, you're gonna remember that.

640
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:50,442
And you're gonna remember
how much I love you.

641
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,483
I remember the first time
your mum and dad brought you home.

642
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:58,666
They were so exhausted.

643
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,072
And they gave you to me.

644
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:05,213
This tiny, defenseless little creature.

645
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,252
And they said, "Look after him,"
and I said, "Sure."

646
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:11,400
And I scooped you up in my arms,

647
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,935
and I held you,
and you opened your eyes...

648
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,951
...and you looked at me.

649
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:25,357
And at that moment, I decided

650
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:28,566
that I would do anything for you.

651
00:42:28,652 --> 00:42:29,817
Anything.

652
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:38,822
So, if this is what you need to do,

653
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,744
Master Bruce, you crack on.

654
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:46,546
You do it.

655
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:10,031
Join me.

656
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,786
Join me.

657
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:19,213
Bruce.

658
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:29,123
Alfred. Alfred!

659
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,387
Alfred!

660
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,270
Alfred, no.

661
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:38,549
Alfred.

662
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:48,809
You've broken through your conditioning.

663
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:51,840
Impressive.

664
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:55,972
You don't control me anymore!

665
00:43:56,152 --> 00:43:58,710
I will never be your heir!

666
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:00,156
On the contrary.

667
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,077
Your strength only confirms
what the prophecy has foretold.

668
00:44:04,515 --> 00:44:10,059
An heir to serve
as my knight in the darkness.

669
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:13,400
I will never

670
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:15,293
follow you!

671
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:18,038
You made me kill Alfred!

672
00:44:18,147 --> 00:44:20,358
Use the waters, Bruce.

673
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,876
Our time will come.

674
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:12,521
Bruce.

675
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,592
Alfred. Alfred. Alfred.

676
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:28,227
<i>A citywide lockdown
continues to remain in effect,</i>

677
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:30,166
<i>with Gotham officials urging people</i>

678
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:34,081
<i>to stay inside their homes, as
thousands of infected citizens</i>

679
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:36,150
<i>continue their rampage through the city.</i>

680
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,314
<i>Local law enforcement is thus far...</i>

681
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:47,357
Lee.

682
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:49,527
Where are you?

683
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:53,026
Why? You miss me?

684
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:56,049
- The city's not safe.
<i>- Mm.</i>

685
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:58,659
Well, that's why I'm packing a bag.

686
00:45:58,846 --> 00:46:00,832
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

687
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,643
I'm leaving Gotham.

688
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:04,845
And I want you to come with me.

689
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,749
<i>I'll take your silence</i>

690
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:09,774
as a yes?

691
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:10,984
<i>Lee, you can't leave.</i>

692
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,020
There are checkpoints all over the city.

693
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,489
Who are you trying to convince, Jim?

694
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,258
I can hear it in your voice:
you want this

695
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:19,749
<i>as much as I do.</i>

696
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:22,830
<i>We can finally be together,
without judgment</i>

697
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:25,898
or secrets or jealousy.

698
00:46:27,171 --> 00:46:29,278
<i>After everything we've been through,</i>

699
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:31,723
don't we deserve that?

700
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,160
I am leaving on the afternoon train.

701
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,618
And I want you with me.

702
00:46:46,622 --> 00:46:48,188
But I want the real you.

703
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,192
<i>So tell me you'll stop fighting it.</i>

704
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,069
<i>Tell me I won't lose you again.</i>

705
00:46:56,665 --> 00:46:58,665
Tell me you'll be there.

706
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,004
I'll be there.

707
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:09,439
Hey, Jim.

708
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,642
Where are we with Tetch?

709
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,134
Barbara and Nygma
gave the mayor's office

710
00:47:13,189 --> 00:47:15,564
a list of demands...
friend snuck me a copy.

711
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:16,913
They also threatened to kill Tetch

712
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:18,670
if we tried to take him back by force.

713
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:20,545
Half of these would bankrupt the city.

714
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,827
The alternative being there's
no city left to bankrupt.

715
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:25,616
We don't have any cards to play,
partner. We got no moves.

716
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:29,271
Yes, we do.

717
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,421
Him.

718
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:31,789
Penguin?

719
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:34,125
This entire list is Barbara's,
except for him.

720
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,793
Penguin is the only thing
Nygma cares about.

721
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:37,762
- The question is: how much?
- No way.

722
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:39,397
There is no way we're turning him over.

723
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:41,132
- Why not?
- Because we don't have the authority

724
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,122
to broker some kind of secret
deal behind the city's back.

725
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:45,036
Much less one that leads to

726
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,204
the imminent death of its former mayor.

727
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,909
Nygma would betray Barbara
and hand over Tetch

728
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:51,642
if given half the chance.
I need to save Lee!

729
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:02,005
I don't have much time, Harvey.

730
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:04,333
It's now or never.

731
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,866
You know, one of these days,
I'm gonna say "never."

732
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,238
Hello?

733
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:30,261
<i>Nygma, it's Gordon.
I'm calling with a proposition.</i>

734
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:31,694
<i>Can you talk?</i>

735
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:37,940
I can listen.

736
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,691
We need to kill her.

737
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:43,518
How much longer are we gonna wait?

738
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:45,262
Come on.

739
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,598
Nygma chopped off your hand.

740
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,467
He almost killed me.

741
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,294
And now Barbara's partners with him?

742
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:52,870
That's the mother of all insults.

743
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:55,867
The city is gonna pay us
a lot of money to get Tetch back.

744
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:58,547
We need to let that play out
before we do anything rash.

745
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:00,321
I know you two are close.

746
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,782
But whatever you had,
she treats you like dirt now.

747
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:07,914
She treats us both like
dirt, and you know it.

748
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:11,196
She doesn't deserve your loyalty.

749
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,571
What are you two whispering about?

750
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,508
Nothing. Any word from city hall?

751
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:18,969
Trust me, we're about to own this town.

752
00:49:19,112 --> 00:49:21,129
Parts of it quite literally.

753
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:25,292
Where's Ed?

754
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,278
He was just here a minute ago.

755
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,957
Tetch?!

756
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:38,335
Nygma!

757
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:40,866
How could you let this happen?

758
00:49:40,984 --> 00:49:42,982
Us? You're the one that trusted him.

759
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:47,755
I asked you to do one thing:
watch a man tied to a chair!

760
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:49,960
You idiots can't even do that!

761
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:56,944
- Where are we going?
- Shut up.

762
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:59,070
Look, I'm not trying to
aggravate you; it's just this

763
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:01,144
doesn't exactly have an
above-the-board feeling about it.

764
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,340
- What's going on?
- Barbara and Nygma have Tetch.

765
00:50:03,404 --> 00:50:06,467
- They're ransoming the city.
- So what does that have to do with me?

766
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:08,631
You're handing me over to him.

767
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:10,817
You can't. You can't.
You cannot do this.

768
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,153
It's a small price to pay
for saving the city.

769
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:15,314
Yeah, for you.
For me, it's a very large price!

770
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:17,756
Look, he cannot be trusted.

771
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,232
You're risking everything based
on the word of a sociopath.

772
00:50:20,257 --> 00:50:22,788
Yeah, yeah. Get in the car.

773
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,594
What? It's gonna be fine.

774
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:25,952
Yeah, Penguin, Nygma, Tetch

775
00:50:25,977 --> 00:50:28,303
all in the same place
for a high-stakes hostage swap.

776
00:50:28,335 --> 00:50:29,773
What could possibly go wrong?

777
00:50:41,894 --> 00:50:43,331
Do you mind?

778
00:50:43,391 --> 00:50:45,842
Look, if I'm gonna be the
city's sacrificial lamb,

779
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:47,422
the least you could do is
lead me to the slaughter

780
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:48,586
with a little dignity.

781
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:50,273
No.

782
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,526
You don't think that I can cause
you trouble once we're inside?

783
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:55,495
You do, and I'll kill you.

784
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,737
No, you won't.
Not before you have Tetch.

785
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:00,214
Not before the exchange goes smoothly.

786
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,041
And after that,
what do you care what happens?

787
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:03,642
Let's just get this over with.

788
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:06,845
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

789
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:16,448
My three favorite men.

790
00:51:17,526 --> 00:51:19,761
Don't feel bad, Oswald.

791
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:22,957
Your death at my hands

792
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:25,144
was inevitable.

793
00:51:26,113 --> 00:51:28,300
Is that what you
told yourself last time?

794
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:31,868
I'm assuming the grenade's
not a fashion statement.

795
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:35,741
Precaution.

796
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,649
You three try anything, I pull the pin.

797
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,146
Kaboom!

798
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:43,027
No more Tetch.

799
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:44,717
No hope for an antidote.

800
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:50,269
- Little crude, don't you think?
- Enough! Let's get this done.

801
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,425
You're infected.

802
00:51:52,698 --> 00:51:54,727
How wonderful.

803
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,128
Nygma!

804
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:04,692
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

805
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:07,745
I knew you'd figure out that this was

806
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,606
about Oswald, but how'd you
figure out where we are?

807
00:52:09,677 --> 00:52:12,407
Please. You know how many cops
I got on the payroll?

808
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:13,912
Oh, baby, you might want to use

809
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:17,616
your inside growl whilst making
secret calls inside the GCPD.

810
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:20,853
Now hand him over.

811
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:30,629
Go!

812
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:46,232
Let him go! Let him go!
We need to get Tetch!

813
00:52:54,615 --> 00:52:55,881
Now!

814
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,679
That little bastard!

815
00:53:08,366 --> 00:53:11,276
Coming through.
Move out of the way. Rita, move.

816
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,114
All right, let's have a look.

817
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:19,244
Whoa. What did you do to cauterize this?

818
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,951
I don't, I don't know.
Is he going to be okay?

819
00:53:22,976 --> 00:53:26,265
We'll do everything we can.
What's your relationship to the patient?

820
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,336
Doctor, BP's falling.

821
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:31,812
We're family.

822
00:53:31,914 --> 00:53:34,259
All right, let's get him
tight, cross-set and prepped for OR.

823
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,471
It looks pretty good.
I'll call the station.

824
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,305
Grab Tetch!

825
00:53:57,225 --> 00:53:58,824
Split up.

826
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:07,792
Jim.

827
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,796
Jim.

828
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:15,146
You and the ex are infected, huh?

829
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,394
I've heard Lee wants to remove
my pretty little head

830
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:21,340
from my body.

831
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,701
Is it weird that kind of
makes me like her?

832
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,725
You thinking about ripping
anyone's head off, Jim?

833
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:30,816
I bet you are.

834
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:33,405
You're so close.

835
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,988
The next time you give in,
the virus will have you.

836
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,156
Stop talking.

837
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,436
Jim!

838
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:42,194
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

839
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:43,908
Hey.

840
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,411
There's no back door, no loading
dock, no way this ends well.

841
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:49,249
The virus will give you
all the strength you need.

842
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:50,936
It's the only option.

843
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:52,982
Give in to the darkness.

844
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:54,388
I said...

845
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:57,017
- <i>Killer.</i>
- stop talking.

846
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:59,185
You want to kill me, that I can see,

847
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,458
but without my blood,
no antidote will there be.

848
00:55:02,505 --> 00:55:04,938
- Fight it, Jim.
- I don't know if I can.

849
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:07,742
He's right. We need him.

850
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:12,664
Yeah, but not all of him.

851
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:19,412
Where are they?!

852
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:20,722
What happened?!

853
00:55:25,462 --> 00:55:27,028
What'd he do?

854
00:55:29,183 --> 00:55:31,004
Oh, Jim.

855
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:33,574
You sick bastard.

856
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,728
Where's the lab tech?

857
00:55:36,293 --> 00:55:37,572
Where's the lab tech?!

858
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,385
Come on, come on. Here, here.

859
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:41,505
What?

860
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:44,635
You've never seen a mason jar
filled with blood before? Go!

861
00:55:44,713 --> 00:55:46,517
Back to work.

862
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,564
You okay?

863
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,733
Oh. Oh.

864
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,928
He's awake.

865
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,045
I was getting lonely.

866
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:13,328
Where are we?

867
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:15,758
Oh, we ran into a police blockade.

868
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,473
Had to hunker down a minute.

869
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,357
Where are you taking me?

870
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:21,797
I don't know.

871
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:24,061
I'm sort of improvising here.

872
00:56:24,243 --> 00:56:26,079
Why? You have someplace you have to be?

873
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:27,519
Does it matter?

874
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:31,073
I imagine you're planning on
dragging this out.

875
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:36,044
There are so few moments
of pure joy in one's life,

876
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:38,982
I feel compelled to savor this one.

877
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:40,872
You mean gloat?

878
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:43,080
Yes, I do.

879
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:47,071
It was always one of your least
attractive qualities, Oswald.

880
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,387
It's killing you, isn't it?

881
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:50,633
What?

882
00:56:50,696 --> 00:56:54,325
To know that you are not
as smart as you think you are.

883
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:57,898
All of that planning to drive me crazy,

884
00:56:57,992 --> 00:56:59,593
strip me of everything I had,

885
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:02,461
revealing yourself with a "ta-da,"

886
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:04,135
and shooting me by the river.

887
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,793
That plan was perfect...

888
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:09,667
and you know it.

889
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:12,371
You failed.

890
00:57:12,965 --> 00:57:14,566
I am still alive,

891
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,940
and you are handcuffed in the backseat.

892
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:22,994
And now you will never be able
to correct your mistake.

893
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,820
I guess not.

894
00:57:29,355 --> 00:57:30,962
Now that they have Tetch's blood,

895
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,964
they can make the antidote;
and after what we tried to pull,

896
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:34,332
the whole city's
gonna be gunning for us.

897
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,667
Hell, I'm surprised the cops
haven't busted down our door already.

898
00:57:36,738 --> 00:57:38,469
Relax. They've got better things to do.

899
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:40,972
What are we supposed to do now?

900
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:43,118
We split up, go to the
safe house, and regroup.

901
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:45,309
Regroup? For what?!

902
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:47,613
For whatever the hell I tell you to do!

903
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:53,803
I'm not waiting anymore.

904
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:56,795
She's broken every promise
she's ever made to you...

905
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:58,366
- to us.
- I know.

906
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,092
Safe house is a perfect place to do it.

907
00:58:02,975 --> 00:58:04,328
Okay.

908
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:06,122
I'll take care of everything.

909
00:58:06,147 --> 00:58:07,319
No.

910
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:10,334
We do it together.

911
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:17,647
Yeah.

912
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,589
Whew.

913
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:34,135
Kowalski and Burrows
are gonna be pissed.

914
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:36,414
Uh, Tetch's blood is good.

915
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:39,288
The lab guys are starting work
on an antidote as we speak.

916
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:40,904
I need to get to Lee. How long?

917
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:43,781
- How long before it's ready?
- They said we could head there now.

918
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:49,524
- Where is it?
- Detective Gordon, just in time.

919
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:51,323
If you'll take a seat
and roll up your sleeve.

920
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:53,167
We have a dose ready for you right now.

921
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:54,812
The others will be ready shortly.

922
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:56,914
I need two.

923
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,441
Sorry. We could only make one of
these single shots so quickly.

924
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:02,169
No. Two.

925
00:59:02,232 --> 00:59:04,155
All of Tetch's blood
is in the centrifuge machines.

926
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,056
- The process can't be interrupted.
- <i>You're a killer.</i>

927
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:07,525
It's just one or two hours, max.

928
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:10,034
You can still catch Lee
before she leaves.

929
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:12,158
There's not enough time.

930
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:13,705
Jim.

931
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:16,268
- <i>Killer!</i>
- Jim. Don't make me... Jim!

932
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:18,104
No, Jim! Jim!

933
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:20,504
Damn it! Someone call the bullpen!

934
00:59:34,865 --> 00:59:35,976
Bruce.

935
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:39,862
I heard about Alfred.

936
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,182
Is he gonna be okay?

937
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:47,565
Go home, Selina.

938
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,198
What happened?

939
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:50,821
No.

940
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,773
- No, you don't get to do this.
- Do what?

941
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,352
Walk back into my life.

942
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:57,294
You think I need your pity? I don't.

943
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,841
- That's not why I'm here.
- You want to know what happened?!

944
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,300
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why?

945
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:09,570
Because I'm-I'm not desperate
to believe in something?

946
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:12,414
Because you don't believe in
anyone or anything but yourself.

947
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,533
It's called surviving.

948
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:19,158
And unlike you,

949
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,916
I know who I am.

950
01:00:22,603 --> 01:00:24,424
I don't need anyone to tell me.

951
01:00:25,618 --> 01:00:27,822
What are you even doing here, Selina?

952
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:29,535
You don't give a damn about Alfred,

953
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,675
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

954
01:00:34,183 --> 01:00:36,526
I know you better than that.

955
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:38,979
Yeah.

956
01:00:40,112 --> 01:00:41,943
I thought you did.

957
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:47,060
Have a nice life.

958
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:55,058
Lee?

959
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,027
I don't like to be kept waiting.

960
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,698
You're still fighting it.

961
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:13,977
I can help you with that.

962
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:18,648
We both know that's not what I want.

963
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:22,648
I want you.

964
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,796
I want you and all your darkness.

965
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,058
Give in.

966
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,196
Give in to your darkness.

967
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:35,120
Be free.

968
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:08,721
Don't you get tired of making
the same mistake over and over?

969
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:12,043
You think I'm making a mistake?

970
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:14,238
Instead of killing me
when you had the chance,

971
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,652
you've decided to feed your ego.

972
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:21,503
You want to talk ego? Riddler?

973
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:25,516
You will always fail, Oswald.

974
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:30,091
Because you will always let
your base emotions drive you.

975
01:02:30,537 --> 01:02:31,889
Hate,

976
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,427
anger, fear,

977
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,497
- love.
- Shut up.

978
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,730
You want to know why I could never

979
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,575
- love someone like you, Oswald?
- I'm warning you.

980
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,290
Because you are a spoiled child
who throws a tantrum

981
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:47,658
any time he doesn't get what he wants!

982
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:51,909
Especially when what he wants
doesn't want him back.

983
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:01,369
You're right. I shouldn't have waited.

984
01:03:01,454 --> 01:03:04,182
But, unlike you, I am in the position

985
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:06,283
to rectify my mistake.

986
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:11,596
Prepare for one massive tantrum.

987
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,909
No!

988
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,830
That is not possible!

989
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:30,173
It is my turn!
It is my turn to kill you!

990
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:32,259
Like I said...

991
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:36,938
...you will always fail!

992
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:39,564
Because you'll never change.

993
01:03:39,986 --> 01:03:41,579
Maybe.

994
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:44,626
But at least I know who I am.

995
01:03:45,267 --> 01:03:47,398
That day, by the edge of the river,

996
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:50,204
that was the moment you were reborn.

997
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:53,337
And that was a lie!

998
01:03:53,634 --> 01:03:57,241
You're entire persona is based

999
01:03:57,306 --> 01:03:58,822
on a lie!

1000
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:02,158
And there is nothing
you can do to change that!

1001
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:07,109
Actually...

1002
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:09,750
maybe there is.

1003
01:04:14,365 --> 01:04:17,292
<i>Attention.
All travelers must pass through</i>

1004
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:19,636
<i>security checkpoints
before boarding the train.</i>

1005
01:04:20,097 --> 01:04:24,132
<i>Please report anyone who might
be displaying signs of infection</i>

1006
01:04:24,157 --> 01:04:27,118
<i>to the nearest checkpoint
or security officer</i>

1007
01:04:27,227 --> 01:04:28,821
<i>so that immediate medical assistance...</i>

1008
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:31,024
Hey, this isn't a public entrance.

1009
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:33,266
Oh, crap.

1010
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:44,330
Police! Move it! Police!

1011
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,081
Move aside! Police!

1012
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:49,193
Move, move! Get out of my way!

1013
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,626
He's trying to stop us.

1014
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:54,146
You can't let him.

1015
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,904
I'll see you on the train.

1016
01:04:56,122 --> 01:04:57,668
Police! Police! Move!

1017
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:00,693
Out of the way! Move! Jim!

1018
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,138
Jim!

1019
01:05:05,172 --> 01:05:07,133
Now we're gonna be delayed, aren't we?

1020
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,102
You gonna shoot me, Harvey?

1021
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:12,883
This isn't you!

1022
01:05:13,186 --> 01:05:14,504
It is.

1023
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,324
Please don't make me do this.

1024
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,765
Lee and I belong together.

1025
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:23,642
I know.

1026
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,436
I know how bad you want that,

1027
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:28,239
to forget about everything
that happened, but you can't.

1028
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:29,406
It's not real.

1029
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,828
This is who I am!

1030
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,266
- This is who I've always been.
- No, it's not!

1031
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,726
Who you are is a choice.

1032
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,906
It always has been. It still is.

1033
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:51,061
This is who you are.

1034
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:54,832
You're the best cop I ever worked with.

1035
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,310
The best friend I've ever had.

1036
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,422
If you love Lee,

1037
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:03,974
go save her.

1038
01:06:12,912 --> 01:06:14,600
Tickets.

1039
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,540
Tickets.

1040
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:27,657
To our great adventure.

1041
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:32,468
Tickets.

1042
01:07:04,704 --> 01:07:06,484
I love you, Lee.

1043
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:18,988
No.

1044
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:22,465
No.

1045
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:25,700
What have you done?

1046
01:08:12,158 --> 01:08:13,424
Really?

1047
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:15,136
A hacksaw?

1048
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,068
Even your disposal tactics are idiotic.

1049
01:08:18,197 --> 01:08:20,367
Guess I'm just old-fashioned.

1050
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,476
Did you really think I
wouldn't figure it out?

1051
01:08:23,736 --> 01:08:25,203
The two of you have been whispering

1052
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:27,028
like teenagers for weeks.

1053
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,460
Oh, Butchie.

1054
01:08:29,756 --> 01:08:32,095
You shouldn't have waited.

1055
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:34,970
Well, believe me,
if it weren't for Tabby,

1056
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:37,287
you'd have been dead a long time ago.

1057
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:40,491
You're trying to tell me
she had nothing to do with this?

1058
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:42,793
- That's right.
- Oh, so you've just

1059
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:44,561
gone behind her back, have you?

1060
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,431
I was gonna hit you
before we got to the safe house.

1061
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,899
Play dumb when you didn't show.

1062
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:50,567
Leaning into your strengths?

1063
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:52,711
You want to know why you're
always taking shots at me?

1064
01:08:52,805 --> 01:08:54,851
The giant size of the target?

1065
01:08:55,976 --> 01:08:58,530
It's because for all your tough talk,

1066
01:08:58,976 --> 01:09:00,577
you miss her.

1067
01:09:01,389 --> 01:09:04,069
You miss her loyalty, her strength.

1068
01:09:04,316 --> 01:09:05,981
She made you better, and you know it.

1069
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:08,762
And you sacrificed that, for what?

1070
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,075
Play queen for a day?

1071
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:13,520
Pathetic.

1072
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,959
If it helps...

1073
01:09:17,396 --> 01:09:19,061
...you never deserved her
in the first...

1074
01:09:26,898 --> 01:09:28,882
I guess we'll see.

1075
01:09:36,746 --> 01:09:38,932
I-I don't know if you can hear me.

1076
01:09:41,408 --> 01:09:43,576
But if you can,

1077
01:09:45,123 --> 01:09:47,147
Alfred, you need to fight.

1078
01:09:50,045 --> 01:09:51,975
I don't know what I would do
without you.

1079
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,781
Alfred, please.

1080
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,195
Please don't leave me.

1081
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,672
Here we are.

1082
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,753
Again.

1083
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,377
Wow.

1084
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:40,221
I have to tell you,

1085
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,049
this feels really great.

1086
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:47,019
Glad I could help.

1087
01:10:49,255 --> 01:10:51,050
Any last words?

1088
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:54,746
I'm fine for now.

1089
01:10:56,138 --> 01:10:57,855
I beg your pardon?

1090
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:00,050
I'll wait.

1091
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:03,108
I'm going to kill you, Oswald.

1092
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:04,963
There is no later.

1093
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,354
If you have something to say...

1094
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,940
now is the time.

1095
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:11,905
Duly noted.

1096
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:13,633
Oh, whatever.

1097
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:15,547
I'm not letting you ruin this for me.

1098
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,953
You don't have anything to say,

1099
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:20,454
but I do.

1100
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:24,398
Good-bye, Oswald.

1101
01:11:36,135 --> 01:11:37,568
I removed the bullets

1102
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:39,607
when you were knocked out.

1103
01:11:39,705 --> 01:11:41,438
Right before I called them.

1104
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:54,350
In the backseat,

1105
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:57,170
the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?

1106
01:11:57,323 --> 01:11:58,733
My tiepin.

1107
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:00,795
I thought it should be personal.

1108
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:03,591
You were just trying to make me
think I had the upper hand.

1109
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,724
It all fell into place.

1110
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:09,451
How did you know that Barbara
would show up at the warehouse?

1111
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:11,724
I didn't.

1112
01:12:12,147 --> 01:12:13,964
If it wasn't for her,

1113
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:16,807
Gordon would have turned me over,
and I'd most likely be dead.

1114
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,676
But fortune favors the bold.

1115
01:12:24,483 --> 01:12:27,621
You said you called them
after you knocked me out.

1116
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:34,272
You knew that I'd bring you here.

1117
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:38,241
I know you, Ed.

1118
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:41,847
I may be driven by my emotions,

1119
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,808
but you are driven by something
much more predictable:

1120
01:12:46,636 --> 01:12:48,722
a desperate, compulsive need

1121
01:12:48,792 --> 01:12:52,324
to complete what you've started
in exacting fashion.

1122
01:12:53,308 --> 01:12:55,616
Why didn't you just kill me, Oswald?

1123
01:12:58,143 --> 01:13:00,884
You were the one time
I let love weaken me,

1124
01:13:01,704 --> 01:13:04,721
and I want you around
as a constant reminder

1125
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:07,274
to never make that mistake again.

1126
01:13:17,015 --> 01:13:18,368
No...

1127
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,666
Barbara?

1128
01:13:35,254 --> 01:13:36,603
Butch?

1129
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:39,384
Butch?

1130
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,793
Was killing Nygma... really

1131
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:12,215
that important to you?

1132
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:17,238
Did you kill Butch?

1133
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,356
He said you didn't have anything to do

1134
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,488
with him trying to kill me.

1135
01:14:23,469 --> 01:14:24,935
Is that true?

1136
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:28,312
What does it matter?

1137
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:31,960
All right, for argument's sake,

1138
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:36,947
let's say I haven't
been the best friend.

1139
01:14:37,865 --> 01:14:40,383
Do you think we could put this behind us

1140
01:14:40,536 --> 01:14:42,521
and move forward?

1141
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:46,753
Did you kill Butch?

1142
01:14:46,878 --> 01:14:48,901
That doesn't sound like a "yes."

1143
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:50,348
I need to know.

1144
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:53,183
It's the only way
we'll be able to move forward.

1145
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:58,037
Yes.

1146
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,779
I killed him.

1147
01:15:01,507 --> 01:15:04,374
But it's not like you gave me a choice!

1148
01:15:06,329 --> 01:15:08,329
There's always a choice.

1149
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:03,173
How many times have I
told you not to bring

1150
01:16:03,236 --> 01:16:05,291
a whip to a gunfight?

1151
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,763
Now we can move forward.

1152
01:16:29,635 --> 01:16:31,297
<i>The Tetch antidote has been released</i>

1153
01:16:31,322 --> 01:16:34,236
<i>over the city with a 90% cure rate,</i>

1154
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:37,107
<i>with individual antidotes
now being manufactured</i>

1155
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:40,029
<i>and given to GCPD officers...</i>

1156
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:41,941
You're awake!

1157
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:51,374
I'm sorry, Alfred.

1158
01:16:53,345 --> 01:16:55,611
It wasn't your fault, was it?

1159
01:16:58,283 --> 01:17:00,524
I completely lost my way.

1160
01:17:01,313 --> 01:17:04,016
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long,

1161
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:06,352
searching for some greater meaning.

1162
01:17:07,752 --> 01:17:10,360
I don't know who I am, Alfred.

1163
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,998
Who am I supposed to be?

1164
01:17:17,755 --> 01:17:19,974
I can't help you with that one, mate.

1165
01:17:21,271 --> 01:17:23,006
You're a man now.

1166
01:17:25,277 --> 01:17:27,788
You got to find your own path.

1167
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,843
I'm not like you.

1168
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:34,070
You've always been
so sure of who you are.

1169
01:17:34,368 --> 01:17:36,641
Oh, I don't know about that.

1170
01:17:37,568 --> 01:17:40,475
I've been through some very dark places,

1171
01:17:40,904 --> 01:17:42,561
as have you.

1172
01:17:45,936 --> 01:17:48,719
You need to find your true north

1173
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,434
and let that guide you.

1174
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,594
What's yours?

1175
01:17:57,454 --> 01:17:59,276
You.

1176
01:18:02,415 --> 01:18:03,880
It's always been you.

1177
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:09,591
You got to find something
that you really care about...

1178
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:13,456
and you protect it at all costs.

1179
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:16,971
And when you find it...

1180
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:22,078
...you'll never be lost again.

1181
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:31,982
<i>And while the arrival of an antidote</i>

1182
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,710
<i>is certainly welcome news,</i>

1183
01:18:33,745 --> 01:18:36,379
<i>the death and the destruction
the virus left in its wake</i>

1184
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:39,983
<i>will no doubt reverberate through
the city for years to come.</i>

1185
01:18:50,543 --> 01:18:52,105
Yeah?

1186
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:54,121
Is Barbara around?

1187
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:56,830
No.

1188
01:18:57,283 --> 01:18:59,041
And she's not coming back.

1189
01:18:59,994 --> 01:19:01,728
What do you want?

1190
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:04,274
I'm not sure.

1191
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:06,836
I just know I'm tired of

1192
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:08,625
just surviving.

1193
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,203
I want more.

1194
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:13,602
I want to move up.

1195
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,618
Figured this was a good place to start.

1196
01:19:20,993 --> 01:19:23,551
I'm at a bit of a crossroads myself.

1197
01:19:24,496 --> 01:19:25,962
You hungry?

1198
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:29,199
You buying?

1199
01:19:36,836 --> 01:19:38,308
Give it a whirl.

1200
01:20:03,335 --> 01:20:06,046
That is the logo for my new club.

1201
01:20:06,624 --> 01:20:08,452
What are we gonna call it?

1202
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,858
The Iceberg Lounge.

1203
01:20:11,163 --> 01:20:13,543
Clever. 'Cause you're
nicknamed Penguin, right?

1204
01:20:13,937 --> 01:20:15,819
There's that.

1205
01:20:16,373 --> 01:20:18,034
And then...

1206
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:22,552
there's the club's
centerpiece attraction.

1207
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:35,639
Lee?

1208
01:20:37,234 --> 01:20:38,867
Lee?

1209
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:56,165
<i>Jim...</i>

1210
01:20:56,388 --> 01:20:59,759
<i>I knew if I saw you, I might
not have the courage to leave.</i>

1211
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:01,823
<i>And I need to.</i>

1212
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,182
<i>I finally understand Gotham</i>

1213
01:21:04,245 --> 01:21:07,093
<i>in a way I suspect you always have.</i>

1214
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:11,734
<i>It's a place where the strongest
and most cunning rule...</i>

1215
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:17,727
<i>...where the cost of survival
is paid for by others...</i>

1216
01:21:20,196 --> 01:21:22,479
<i>...and everyone feels alone.</i>

1217
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:27,569
<i>Having the virus showed me
the city as it truly was.</i>

1218
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:30,671
<i>As I truly was.</i>

1219
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:35,917
<i>In so many ways,
the virus made me feel reborn.</i>

1220
01:21:36,011 --> 01:21:37,949
He's a gangster; probably
got what he deserved.

1221
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:40,175
- He is?
- Sure. That's Butch Gilzean.

1222
01:21:40,246 --> 01:21:44,450
Really? His chart lists
his birth name as Cyrus Gold.

1223
01:21:44,543 --> 01:21:45,731
Cyrus Gold?

1224
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:47,887
He must have changed it at some point.

1225
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:49,849
<i>But if having the virus</i>

1226
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:52,781
<i>allowed Gotham to embrace
its worst self,</i>

1227
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:56,531
<i>the cure should remind us
there is always hope.</i>

1228
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:59,929
<i>A chance to remember who we can be</i>

1229
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:02,304
<i>rather than who we are.</i>

1230
01:22:04,356 --> 01:22:06,452
<i>I don't know if Gotham deserves saving,</i>

1231
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,412
<i>but I do know one thing.</i>

1232
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:11,100
<i>If anyone can save it...</i>

1233
01:22:11,744 --> 01:22:13,432
<i>it's you.</i>

1234
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:18,666
<i>And in return, I believe
it can save you as well.</i>

1235
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:22,560
<i>And then maybe one day,</i>

1236
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,380
<i>it will send you back to me.</i>

1237
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:28,381
<i>Until then,</i>

1238
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:31,516
<i>love always...</i>

1239
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,032
<i>Lee.</i>

1240
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,270
Can I come in, Captain?

1241
01:22:50,645 --> 01:22:51,834
No.

1242
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:55,071
You threw me against a train car.

1243
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:58,532
- I know.
- Two... actually.

1244
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,104
I felt like a freaking cartoon.

1245
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:02,151
I am really sorry about that.

1246
01:23:04,049 --> 01:23:05,509
You see Lee?

1247
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:08,248
She's gone.

1248
01:23:08,423 --> 01:23:09,819
She left Gotham.

1249
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:11,721
You okay?

1250
01:23:13,861 --> 01:23:15,564
I will be.

1251
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:19,529
- You want to get a drink?
- It's noon.

1252
01:23:19,564 --> 01:23:22,965
I didn't ask you what time it was.
I asked if you wanted to get a drink.

1253
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:24,621
Sure.

1254
01:23:25,403 --> 01:23:26,785
I'm good.

1255
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:28,832
Any word on Tetch?

1256
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:30,526
Yeah, he stumbled into some hospital.

1257
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:33,728
They patched him up,
shipped him back to Arkham.

1258
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,845
You know, I'd actually like to
get back to being a detective.

1259
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:39,064
Do some good old-fashioned police work.

1260
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:42,436
The kind that doesn't involve
secret cults or blood viruses.

1261
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:44,452
- Do we have anything like that?
- Not really.

1262
01:23:44,545 --> 01:23:46,489
Half the force is coming off
24-hour shifts,

1263
01:23:46,524 --> 01:23:48,867
but we could, uh... hit the streets

1264
01:23:48,892 --> 01:23:50,719
like a couple of old beat cops,

1265
01:23:50,744 --> 01:23:52,428
see if we could stir up
some trouble, huh?

1266
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:55,337
I don't know, seems kind of beneath me.

1267
01:23:56,228 --> 01:23:57,966
You know, seeing as I'm the...

1268
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:00,411
best cop you've
ever worked with and all.

1269
01:24:00,466 --> 01:24:03,138
Oh, oh, I was just telling you
whatever crap came to mind

1270
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:04,576
so you wouldn't punch a hole
through my head.

1271
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,504
Uh-huh.

1272
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:07,301
Like a hostage negotiation,
you just tell someone

1273
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:09,171
- what they want to hear.
- Sure, sure.

1274
01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:10,771
If you didn't have the virus,

1275
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,282
- I would've kicked your butt.
- Is that right?

1276
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:13,850
Yeah, absolutely.

1277
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:20,371
It was so good.

1278
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:21,824
That was such a good dinner.

1279
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,626
I never ever had sushi like that.

1280
01:24:24,418 --> 01:24:26,129
It was great, whatever it was.

1281
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:28,698
Money!

1282
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:29,799
- Now!
- Dad?

1283
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,501
- It's-it's okay, sweetheart.
- Now!

1284
01:24:34,468 --> 01:24:35,932
No!

1285
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:38,041
- Dad!
- No!

1286
01:25:38,571 --> 01:25:43,571
