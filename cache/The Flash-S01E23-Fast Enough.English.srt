1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,135
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,390
<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.</i>

3
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,393
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,817
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...</i>

6
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:31,989
<i>...but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

7
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,702
<i>And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.</i>

8
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,829
<i>That day is today.</i>

9
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:44,919
What?

10
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,337
No Big Belly Burger?

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,839
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

12
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,927
We're out of cows where I come from.
You don't care about that. You have questions.

13
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,096
I'm not sure where to start.

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,389
Thawne.

15
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,181
That is your real name?

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,350
-Eobard Thawne?
-Since the day I was born.

17
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,270
-When was that?
-One hundred and thirty-six years from now.

18
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,730
This is not what you wanna know.

19
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:08,566
Go ahead, Barry.

20
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,109
Ask it.

21
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,444
Why did you kill my mother?

22
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,404
Because I hate you.

23
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:18,072
Not you now.

24
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,532
You years from now.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,285
-In the future.
-In a future, yes.

26
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:25,746
We're enemies, rivals, opposites.
Reverses of one another.

27
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:27,539
Why? Why were enemies?

28
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:29,291
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,961
It doesn't matter anymore.

30
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:37,089
What matters is neither of us
was strong enough to defeat the other.

31
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,092
Until I learned your secret.

32
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,720
I learned your name.

33
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,389
Barry Allen.

34
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:49,476
And finally, I knew how to defeat you
once and for all.

35
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,313
Travel back in time, kill you as a child...

36
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:56,358
...wipe you from the face of the earth.

37
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:02,323
But then you, future you, that is,
followed me back and we fought.

38
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:05,284
WELLS:
<i>We both landed some pretty solid shots.</i>

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,163
And then you, future you,
got your younger self out of there.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,751
I was so mad.

41
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,587
But then I thought...

42
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,881
...what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

43
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:27,179
What if you were to suffer something
so horrible, so traumatic...

44
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:31,099
...that your child self could never recover?
Then you would not become the Flash.

45
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,018
So I stabbed your mother in the heart.

46
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,353
WELLS:
<i>And I was free.</i>

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,274
Finally able to return to a future
without the Flash.

48
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:45,488
Only to realize that in traveling back,
I lost my way home.

49
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,908
Lost my ability to harness the Speed Force.

50
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:55,038
And without it,
I was stuck here, stranded in this time...

51
00:02:55,205 --> 00:03:00,877
...unable to return to my home,
and the only one way back was the Flash.

52
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:04,923
But the Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

53
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:11,888
Why train me?

54
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:14,974
Why help me save so many people?

55
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:18,061
Because I needed you to get fast.

56
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:24,984
Fast enough to rupture the space-time barrier
and create a stable wormhole...

57
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,069
...through which I could return home.

58
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,570
Why would I ever do that?

59
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:32,865
Because, Barry Allen...

60
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,743
...if you give me what I want...

61
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,663
...I'm gonna give you what you want.

62
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:43,459
You can go back and save your mother.

63
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:47,088
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

64
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:50,591
You can reunite the Allen family.

65
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:55,388
No.

66
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,056
No, I don't believe you.

67
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,729
I wanna kill you right now.

68
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,105
I know that rage.

69
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,066
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

70
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,485
And now somehow...

71
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:14,740
...I know what Joe and Henry feel...

72
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,867
...when they look on you with pride.

73
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,411
With love.

74
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:24,457
No. No, don't you ever say that to me.

75
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:28,085
I know you're upset,
but I'm giving you a chance.

76
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,923
I'm giving you a chance
to undo all the evil I've done.

77
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,968
Don't you want that chance?

78
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:55,652 X1:0
A rare opportunity to go back in time
and right a wrong...

79
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,238 X1:0
...and save your mother's life.

80
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,284
Quite the paradox
Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen.

81
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,995
The chance to be with someone you love?

82
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,830 X1:0
Seems pretty cut-and-dry to me.

83
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,837 X1:0
At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear so,
but this gift has unparalleled risk.

84
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,174
Barry, the night your mother died...

85
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,302 X1:0
...the night you saved yourself
from being killed...

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,682 X1:0
...that event altered the timeline you were
already on, and changed the course of history.

87
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,603 X1:0
So, what you're saying is
we're living in a parallel universe?

88
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:34,316
-Just like when I time-traveled before.
-But he only changed one day that time.

89
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:39,696 X1:0
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

90
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:44,493 X1:0
One different decision, no matter how
big or small, impacts everything that follows.

91
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:48,831 X1:0
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices, new relationships.

92
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,585 X1:0
Nothing would be as it is today,
and you'd never know the difference...

93
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,713 X1:0
...because you'd never remember any of it.

94
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:05,097 X1:0
So if I go back and save my mom,
my dad doesn't go to prison.

95
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,393 X1:0
I never live with Joe and Iris.

96
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:15,815 X1:0
You might never meet me
or Caitlin or Ronnie.

97
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,066
STEIN:
Truth is...

98
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:23,698 X1:0
...there's no real way of knowing
what your life will be.

99
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:31,329 X1:0
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

100
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,747
You gotta change the past.

101
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,421 X1:0
Joe.

102
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,259 X1:0
So, what, that's it?

103
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:49,595 X1:0
You think I should just do it?

104
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:53,682 X1:0
Yeah, I do.

105
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:56,977 X1:0
Which means
I will never come to live with you...

106
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,644
...and you're okay with that?

107
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:03,357 X1:0
Barry, you get the chance to grow up
with both parents.

108
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:07,527 X1:0
-You don't have to grow up without a mother.
-What about growing up without a father?

109
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,405 X1:0
You will have a father. Your real father.

110
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,952 X1:0
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

111
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,247
This is why you became the Flash, Barry.

112
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,373
To put things right.

113
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,460 X1:0
You saved a lot of people's lives
this past year.

114
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,296
Now it's time to save yours.

115
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,278
BARRY:
Dad, look, I know this sounds crazy.

116
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:54,822
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

117
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:59,243
Look, you're fast, I get it,
but turning back time--

118
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:04,749
I wouldn't be turning time back.
I would be going back.

119
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,751
To that night, to save her.

120
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,003
What does Joe think about all this?

121
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,839
He thinks I should do it.

122
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,217
No.

123
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,009
You can't.

124
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,428
Dad....

125
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:29,143
I can make it so
that night will never have happened.

126
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:32,021
-We'll be a family again.
-We are a family.

127
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,441
Not like this, not without Mom.

128
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,737
Barry, there's a natural order to things.

129
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:42,240
Okay, things happen the way they do.

130
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,119
We may not know why at the time,
but there must always be a reason.

131
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,831
Now, I believe that. I've had to believe it.

132
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,460
I-- I can save Mom.

133
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:55,795
At what cost?

134
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,464
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

135
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,675
-Well, I don't care.
-I do.

136
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,222
I am in awe...

137
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:10,726
...of the remarkable man
that you are becoming.

138
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,313
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as the Flash...

139
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,857
...but you, Barry...

140
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,860
...your honesty, your heart.

141
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,155
You were always a hero.

142
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:27,576
And your mom would be just as proud.

143
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:30,704
And if she had a say in this,
if she thought for one second...

144
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,708
...you going back to save her would mean
you losing what makes you so special...

145
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,918
...she would never want that.

146
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,339
Barry, what I hope for you...

147
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:46,553
...maybe the greatest thing
that a father can hope for his son...

148
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:51,224
...is that one day
you will become a father yourself.

149
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,019
And then you will know...

150
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:02,359
...how much I truly love you.

151
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,781
[THERMOMETER BEEPS]

152
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,075
CAITLIN:
Ninety-eight-point-six.

153
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,326
Normal.

154
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:13,079
-Don't know what that word means anymore.
CAITLIN: Me neither.

155
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,124
I know Barry really appreciates you
coming back to help him stop Wells.

156
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:19,751
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

157
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,543
I'm here now, for good.

158
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,879
-But I thought--
-I thought too.

159
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:27,966
Okay, I thought too much about what might
happen if the government tracked us down.

160
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,763
If we couldn't control our powers
and we hurt someone, if we hurt you.

161
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:39,394
But I realized that, although
sometimes, I'm more than one man...

162
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,606
...I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

163
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,899
I love you, Cait.

164
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,489
-Are you sure?
-I am.

165
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,157
Once upon a time...

166
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:55,327
...and a particle accelerator or so ago...

167
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,745
...you agreed to marry me.

168
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,915
-Yes, I did.
-What do you say we do that?

169
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,509
IRIS:
Thought I might find you here.

170
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,807
I needed to get out of the lab.

171
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,354
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

172
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,189
Oh, it is, trust me.

173
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,651
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

174
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,905
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings
with the mysterious Streak.

175
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,993
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

176
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,204
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

177
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:41,664
[IRIS LAUGHS]

178
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,207
No.

179
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:51,132
So are you gonna do it?

180
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:57,805
It's just so huge.

181
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,352
It's the biggest decision of my life,
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

182
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,813
Why would you want to? I mean...

183
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,816
...you'd get to see your mom again...

184
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,067
...your dad.

185
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,153
Have a great career.

186
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,572
Even get married.

187
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,743
Iris West-Allen, huh?

188
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,914
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

189
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,584
Must be a 2024 thing.

190
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:32,254
We don't know that
that's gonna happen. I mean--

191
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:37,467
Do you think that
because you didn't live with us...

192
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,220
...that's why things are different there?

193
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:47,018
Growing up together
and knowing so much about each other...

194
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:52,482
...it made it hard for me
to admit how I felt about you.

195
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,612
And I waited too long,
and you fell in love with Eddie.

196
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,864
But....

197
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,411
But living with you and Joe....

198
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,290
I've had a great life, Iris.

199
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,627
Come here, Barry.

200
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,469
What do you think I should do?

201
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,014
I need someone to tell me.

202
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,937
I think...

203
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,233
...that for once in your life, Barry Allen...

204
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,819
...you should stop thinking
about other people.

205
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,155
I think you should do what's in your heart.

206
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,325
Do what you need to do for yourself.

207
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,959
Ah.

208
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,838
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

209
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,258
...it took you a whole hour longer to decide
than I thought it would.

210
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,261
So how does this work?

211
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,640
-Your grand plan.
-Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry.

212
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,267
In fact, it's rather simple.

213
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,353
-We use the particle accelerator.
-The particle acce--

214
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,858
The last time that happened, you caused
an explosion that hurt a lot of people.

215
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:23,946
This time, the accelerator will operate
exactly the way it was designed to.

216
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,116
Except instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions...

217
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,827
...colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring...

218
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:34,331
...we're only gonna inject one particle
into the accelerator.

219
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,585
And I'm what it collides with.

220
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,879
And if you can go fast enough, Barry...

221
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,882
...if you can hit that particle
with enough speed...

222
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,968
...you will punch a hole
right through the fabric of reality.

223
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,803
And you will create a portal...

224
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:52,973
...connecting this time...to infinite times.

225
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,851
A wormhole.

226
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,687
Through which one might travel
back to the past...

227
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:04,693
...say, to the night your mother died,
or forward to the future to, say, my time.

228
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:10,699
You said if I run fast enough.
What happens if I don't?

229
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:14,077
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry...

230
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,204
...you'll die.

231
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,002
STEIN:
According to Wells' calculations...

232
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,922
...Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

233
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,424
Once Barry reaches optimum speed...

234
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:32,095
...we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

235
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:35,515
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms...

236
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:39,477
...opening a gateway into time itself.

237
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,980
At that moment, I plan on shouting
something along the lines of:

238
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:45,107
"Eureka," or possibly, "Excelsior."

239
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,401
I'm uncommitted.

240
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:48,985
What do you think?

241
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:54,532
I mean, on the one hand,
it does make a kind of sense.

242
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,033
On the other hand...

243
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,493
...why?

244
00:15:57,993 --> 00:15:59,036
Why?

245
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:02,623
-Why would you ever consider doing this?
-You know why.

246
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:05,292
So for this to work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

247
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:08,129
By my estimates, Mach 2 at a minimum.

248
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,632
You've never gone that fast.

249
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,802
So, what happens
if Barry doesn't reach that speed?

250
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:18,222
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield. How far off am I?

251
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:20,683
Not very far, I'm afraid.

252
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,477
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

253
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,855
-We're gonna need something else too.
-Really?

254
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:29,607
And what's that?
Because I don't know about you guys...

255
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:33,153
...but I'm not at all interested in helping you
get yourself killed.

256
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,155
I need you to build a time machine.

257
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,824
Go on.

258
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:43,163
So if Wells is as fast as you,
what's he need a time machine for?

259
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,832
Apparently, he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

260
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,502
He gets it back sometimes, but only in spurts.
He can't fully control it.

261
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,338
I was right. He was using
the wheelchair to charge himself.

262
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:56,968
So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna need
the ship to travel back to the future.

263
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:00,847
-He's been squirreling away the parts.
-Now we just need to put it together.

264
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:04,016
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine...

265
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,726
...not a bookcase from Ikea.

266
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:09,021
We got a problem.
These tiles, they're made of tungsten.

267
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:12,065
Tungsten has the highest
melting point of any other element.

268
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,693
Yeah, uh, but the dust it generates
is flammable.

269
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,362
-The pressure exerted from the wormhole--
-Yeah, yeah.

270
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,574
It could cause a hole
to be melted into the exterior.

271
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,033
It could explode.

272
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,534
Any ideas?

273
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,537
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

274
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:30,081
Heh. Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

275
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:39,381
-Something on your mind, Cisco?
-No.

276
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:45,387
Yes. How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit
into that little ring?

277
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,805
Is it some sort of compressed microtech?

278
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:51,059
Or-- Actually, forget it. I don't care.

279
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,395
Maybe a little.

280
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,107
Ronnie's right. I should've accounted
for temporal shearing.

281
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:00,443
Glad we're still good for something.

282
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,905
I've never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

283
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:09,285
Or Ronnie. As a matter of fact,
do you know how many times...

284
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:12,121
...I wished you were with me
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

285
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:14,123
-Would've been a lot more fun.
-Yeah?

286
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:19,420
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that your nifty little Time Sphere--

287
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,632
-Oh, is that what you're calling it?
-Whatever it's called. It's gonna blow.

288
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,051
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

289
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,304
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

290
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:30,640
Okay. Fine, we'll try that.

291
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,267
That's it? That's all?

292
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,059
Well, what do you want me to say?

293
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:38,105
I don't know. I thought of anyone, you'd be
more understanding of my predicament.

294
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,107
I don't belong here.

295
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,193
These barbaric times.

296
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,612
-It's like living among the dead.
-Is that what you told yourself...

297
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,197
...when you killed me?

298
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,366
What?

299
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:54,785
What did you say?

300
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:01,959
It was an alternate timeline,
one that Barry reset.

301
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,377
But I never forgot it.

302
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:07,797
It just kept coming back to me.

303
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:12,844
And I can still picture
the way you looked at me...

304
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,512
...when you called me a son.

305
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,683
And you crushed my heart...

306
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,101
...with your fist.

307
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,645
Cisco...

308
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:25,148
...I'm sorry.

309
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:29,861
-Yeah, it sucked.
-Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a reason.

310
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,615
I'm sorry for the fact that you're able
to retain traces of another timeline.

311
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:37,619
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe. It means...

312
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:43,124
-I wasn't sure until just now.
-Sure of what?

313
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:49,672
The night the particle accelerator exploded...

314
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,760
...you were affected too.

315
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,223
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,558
[SCOFFS]

317
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,851
No.

318
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,021
I wasn't.

319
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,649
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

320
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:14,738
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

321
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:19,368
I only hope that
as you're living your great adventure...

322
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:23,455
...that you remember who gave you that life.

323
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:28,418
And that it was given out of love.

324
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:48,230
I'm sorry, but I'm told this is the only station
with enough power to run these calculations.

325
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,649
If we make a slight error
creating the wormhole--

326
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,735
Say no more. Joe told me
to stick around in case I was needed...

327
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:57,906
-...but it seems I'm only in the way.
-Well, everyone has a contribution to make.

328
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,742
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

329
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:05,080
No, Dr. Wells made it pretty clear when
he told me about the future, I don't matter.

330
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:09,751
As far as history's concerned,
I don't save the day, or get the girl.

331
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,503
And you believed him?

332
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:15,716
He had a newspaper from the year 2024.

333
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:19,428
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

334
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:23,724
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify to its authenticity.

335
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,981
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

336
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,358
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be...

337
