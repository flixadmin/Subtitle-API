00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,170
that we have

the highest mortality rate

[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

I wouldn't take

such extreme measures...

540
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,100
Oh, extreme?

541
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,100
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

Fuck your mission.

You have the military

you have what it takes

to be a leader.

553
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,020
No, I'm no fucking leader!

Then I'll make you one.

Good. Let's meet your team.

She was gonna kill his kid?

[Waller] Each member

of the team is chosen

This is Christopher Smith,

known as Peacemaker.

568
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,220
In his hands,

569
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,220
anything is a deadly weapon.

570
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,010
His father was a soldier

571
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,010
who trained his son

572
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,020
how to kill from the moment

573
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,020
he was born.

-Are you having a laugh?

575
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,000
-What?

576
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,190

for their unique abilities.

579

He does exactly what I do.

580
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
But better.

581
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,020
I always hit

582
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,020
my targets dead center.

583
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,120
I hit them more in the center.

584
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,190
Well, you can't hit something

585
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,190
more in a center.

586
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,050
-I use smaller bullets.

587
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,050
-What?

588
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,120
They go inside

589
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,120
your bullet holes

590
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,180
without even touching the side.

591
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,090
Next up is King Shark.

592
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,100
[Peacemaker] Holy shit.

What the fuck?

594
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,050
[Waller] Some people claim

595
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,010
that Nanaue is a descendant

596
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,010
of an ancient shark god.

597
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,110
Whatever the case,

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,230
it is potentially cataclysmic

703

for Americans and the world.

Your mission

and destroy every trace

714

known as La Gatita Amable.

715
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,150
Get Grieves to help you

716
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,150
by whatever means necessary

717
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,000
and he can get you

718
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,000

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,060
Any questions?

[Waller] That is

No, not really.

725
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
So, why don't you

All right,

to get to Valle Del Mar.

You're the leader.

You're supposed to be decisive.

759
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,160
And I've decided

760
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,160
that you should eat

I would say no problemo.

all over the beach?

I think liberty
