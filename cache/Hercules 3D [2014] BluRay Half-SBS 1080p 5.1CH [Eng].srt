1
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,143
<i>You think you know
the truth about him?</i>

2
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,636
<i>You know nothing.</i>

3
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,311
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

4
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,395
<i>King of the gods.</i>

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,739
<i>His mother, Alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

6
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,446
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

7
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:14,409
<i>Half human,</i>

8
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,912
<i>half god.</i>

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,836
<i>But Zeus' queen, Hera,
saw this bastard child as an insult,</i>

10
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:28,134
<i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i>

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,628
<i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,</i>

12
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,884
<i>which means "glory of Hera,"</i>

13
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,974
<i>but this failed to appease the goddess.</i>

14
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,977
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

15
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,912
<i>Luckily, he took after his father.</i>

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,703
<i>Once he reached manhood,</i>

17
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:08,786
<i>the gods commanded him
to perform Twelve Labors,</i>

18
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>twelve dangerous missions.</i>

19
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,165
<i>If he completed them all and survived,</i>

20
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,129
<i>Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

21
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:38,394
<i>He fought the Lernean Hydra!</i>

22
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,498
<i>He battled the Erymanthean Boar!</i>

23
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:11,262
<i>But his greatest Labor
was the Nemean Lion.</i>

24
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,764
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

25
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:25,232
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

26
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,909
<i>But even this monster was no match
for the son of Zeus.</i>

27
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,201
What a load of crap!

28
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,869
Every word is true.

29
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,871
You know what I think?

30
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:56,750
This friend of yours doesn't even exist.

31
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,257
Laugh all you want.

32
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,219
He's coming. And be warned, Gryza,
he despises pirates.

33
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,054
Macedonia has been good to us.

34
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:09,015
Plenty of villages ripe for pillaging.

35
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:10,429
We are here to stay.

36
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,767
Finish him.

37
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:17,568
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

38
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:21,605
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

39
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:30,162
Yet, <i>as</i> I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,288
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.

41
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,032
Yet, he still destroyed it.

42
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:38,962
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

43
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:45,046
I did it with my bare hands!

44
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,674
Or so they say.

45
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,427
Hercules.

46
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,137
Is this all the men you have?

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,179
There's 40 of us. One of you.

48
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:03,148
The king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you.

49
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:06,149
So leave, or die.

50
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:07,981
I get paid either way.

51
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,272
Make him bleed.

52
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,075
Five men with a single blow.

53
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,033
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

54
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,116
Bring me his head!

55
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,209
Seems they need
more convincing, Autolycus.

56
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,630
That's why we're here.

57
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,047
Atalanta.

58
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,712
Amphiaraus.

59
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:43,973
May Zeus forgive you.

60
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,721
Tydeus?

61
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:09,995
Die, Hercules!

62
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:18,128
Ah, good man.

63
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,629
Hurry!

64
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,552
Hurry! Uncle!

65
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,758
Uncle, hurry!

66
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,518
Hurry! Hurry!

67
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,014
Any longer, Uncle...

68
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:45,060
And the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions.

69
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,692
The rest of you may go.

70
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,191
But not you.

71
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,956
Thirteen,

72
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:10,585
14,15,153,

73
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:14,501
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

74
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:18,630
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

75
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,759
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

76
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:21,923
Not a bad night.

77
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,719
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

78
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:28,099
Their resolve must be broken, lolaus.

79
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:29,935
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

80
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,185
make it bigger, scarier.

81
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:35,269
The more they believe
Hercules is truly the son of Zeus,

82
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,943
the less likely they are to fight.

83
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,029
Oh!

84
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,732
Aye.

85
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,575
- Amphiaraus?
- Mmm?

86
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,569
Care to join us here on Earth?

87
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,746
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,
fighting across a sea of corpses.

88
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,586
If you're going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

89
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,053
Huh?

90
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:17,641
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

91
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:20,056
Fight it!

92
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,940
Keep practicing, boys!

93
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,602
So who's next? You? You?

94
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:26,773
Ah!

95
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,614
That's a pretty sight.

96
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,070
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

97
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:36,111
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

98
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,496
Or live simply.

99
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,624
You still dreaming of barbarian lands?

100
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,207
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

101
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:49,289
That is where I will live out
the rest of my days in solitude.

102
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,548
Boring, if you ask me.

103
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,341
Maybe so, Autolycus.

104
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,753
But I'll never find peace unless
I move <i>as</i> far away as possible.

105
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,388
What of Tydeus?

106
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:02,342
Without you to temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

107
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,475
Tydeus will go with me.

108
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,303
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

109
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,642
Uncle!

110
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,725
Join us.
The girls are eager to welcome you.

111
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,780
See? I told you I knew Hercules.

112
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:26,865
Are you his servant?

113
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,530
I'm his nephew.

114
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:29,655
Are you, really?

115
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,448
I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

116
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,205
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

117
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:35,410
the Belt of Hippolyta

118
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,497
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

119
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,174
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

120
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,798
It is a wonder
you share the same blood <i>as</i> Hercules.

121
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,675
Have fun.

122
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,717
- Ladies.
- Oh...

123
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,657
What do you want with Hercules?

124
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,489
My words are for him, not you.

125
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,739
Atalanta, it's all right.

126
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:24,452
You certainly are a hard man to find.

127
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:26,541
Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

128
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,421
I'm not just anyone.

129
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,207
My name is Ergenia,
daughter to Lord Cotys.

130
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:34,547
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

131
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,972
My father is most unfortunate.

132
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:41,219
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

133
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,639
Our land is torn by civil war.

134
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,601
Every day, villages are destroyed,
crops ruined, innocents slaughtered.

135
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,563
We all have problems.

136
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:54,528
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

137
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,228
Unfortunately, My Lady,

138
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,443
Hercules is fully committed
till the Feast of Dionysus.

139
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,065
We could, however,

140
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:04,406
advance you to the front of the line,
for the right price.

141
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:05,610
Hmm.

142
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:07,412
I thought heroes fight for glory.

143
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,448
But mercenaries fight for gold.

144
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:11,286
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

145
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:12,666
I like him already.

146
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:16,420
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

147
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,879
Eat up.

148
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:29,802
"A lion and crow in strange alliance."

149
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:31,967
Told you.

150
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,397
Where are we going?

151
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,589
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

152
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:50,666
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

153
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,873
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

154
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,204
Ah.

155
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,499
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

156
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,676
Though not quite <i>as</i> big an honor
as I expected.

157
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,463
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

158
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,764
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

159
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:15,554
It's meant to be.

160
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,099
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

161
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,518
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

162
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:25,985
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

163
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,525
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

164
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,987
Mother!

165
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,822
Arius.

166
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:38,410
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

167
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,871
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

168
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,994
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

169
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:45,875
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

170
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,004
Hercules is probably tired.

171
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,832
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

172
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:50,794
That's enough, Arius. Come along.

173
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,425
Stay away from him.

174
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:55,220
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

175
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,639
But he's Hercules. He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

176
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,560
Lord Cotys will see you now.

177
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,777
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

178
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,779
Once or twice.

179
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,912
- Father!
- Ah!

180
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:40,374
Megara.

181
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,046
Welcome home, my love.

182
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,052
Hercules!

183
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,894
Whenever I'm here, I imagine
this is what Elysium must look like.

184
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,818
Well, men like us
have the means

185
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,943
to create our own paradise on Earth.

186
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,443
Look.

187
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,028
Magnificent, aren't they?

188
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,613
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

189
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,453
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

190
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,629
<i>The masks of serpents.</i>

191
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,715
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

192
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,139
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

193
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,137
Let the people have their hero.

194
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,849
All hail King Eurystheus.

195
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,268
And the mighty protector of Athens,

196
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,816
Hercules!

197
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:53,228
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

198
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:57,657
A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

199
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,153
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

200
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,372
Lord Cotys awaits.

201
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,811
Hercules.

202
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:35,688
Welcome.

203
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:39,692
An honor to host such a legend.

204
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:41,856
Lord Cotys.

205
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:45,530
But in legend, you fight alone.

206
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,863
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

207
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,402
Autolycus of Sparta.

208
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,536
Tydeus of Thebes.

209
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,288
Atalanta of Scythia.

210
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,375
Lolaus of Athens.

211
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,585
And Amphiaraus of Argos.

212
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:08,000
Amphiaraus?

213
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,210
The famed seer of Argos.

214
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,635
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

215
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:19,389
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

216
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:22,057
What else can you tell of the future?

217
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,022
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

218
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:26,097
A shame.

219
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:29,435
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

220
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,230
The gods can be frustrating sometimes,
Lord Cotys.

221
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:44,456
With respect, I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

222
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,658
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

223
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:56,832
I stand corrected.

224
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,178
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

225
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:05,431
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

226
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,893
But now Thrace is divided.

227
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,848
This war has depleted our forces.

228
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:14,648
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

229
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,853
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

230
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,360
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

231
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,483
Only by a god.

232
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,523
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

233
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,151
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

234
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,909
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

235
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,123
Centaurs?

236
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,080
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

237
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,588
Come, Hercules.

238
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:47,296
Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

239
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:55,052
Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

240
00:18:55,214 --> 00:19:00,311
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

241
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:04,564
I feared nothing could ever
be good again, till you arrived.

242
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,395
I'm just a mercenary fighting for gold.

243
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:12,446
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

244
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,989
How others perceive us is important.

245
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,989
And your name, like it or not,

246
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,369
is a rallying cry.

247
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,203
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

248
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,622
Nobody has any faith anymore.

249
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,836
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

250
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:43,218
My son believes in you.

251
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,681
Bring us peace,

252
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:49,852
and I will believe in you, too.

253
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,106
I'm convinced these are good people.

254
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,240
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

255
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:07,284
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing <i>as</i> a pair of breasts.

256
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,610
Maybe, but gold never ages.

257
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,991
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

258
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,324
Double your weight in gold?
Well done.

259
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:16,453
Amphiaraus?

260
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:17,954
If it be the will of Zeus.

261
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:20,412
Which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

262
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:24,089
"Hercules: Savior of Thrace"
or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?

263
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,087
Both sound terrifyingly boring.

264
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,885
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

265
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,093
Train them.

266
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:36,599
Oh, shit.

267
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:46,563
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

268
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:48,442
Surviving.

269
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,190
My companions and I will show you
how to stay alive,

270
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:57,239
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

271
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,028
Autolycus.

272
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:03,744
Shield wall! Form!

273
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,299
Corpses! Every last one of you!

274
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,142
Because your shield wall was weak.

275
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:28,639
Dead.

276
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,432
Dead.

277
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:32,267
Very dead.

278
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:35,357
Soldier,

279
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,642
many lives depend on you.

280
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,812
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

281
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:44,861
You understand?

282
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,282
Yes, sir.

283
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:48,819
When a shield wall is strong,

284
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,947
nothing can ever defeat it!

285
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:55,667
You must learn to work together,
react together.

286
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:59,996
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

287
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,422
that will be stronger than iron.

288
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,051
I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

289
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:14,425
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

290
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:20,513
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

291
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:22,814
Ah! There you are!

292
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:27,310
Hercules, my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

293
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,269
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

294
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:33,066
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

295
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:34,694
Demons march with them.

296
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,484
So now we're fighting demons.

297
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,529
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

298
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:43,410
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

299
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,667
He will be on them within six days.

300
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:49,374
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

301
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,710
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

302
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,502
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

303
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,678
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

304
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,763
Face Rhesus with an untrained army

305
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,798
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

306
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,016
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

307
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,181
The longer Rhesus lives,

308
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:16,018
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed.

309
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:19,738
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

310
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,905
Hercules,
the gods have offered us a gift.

311
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,111
We must not squander it.

312
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,830
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

313
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,447
No.

314
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,283
The son of Zeus will.

315
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,413
Your mother told you to stay away.
You should listen.

316
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,420
What's wrong with him?

317
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:29,342
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

318
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,306
He was born in war.

319
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:36,648
When l found him,
he was more animal than human.

320
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,564
He never speaks of what he saw.

321
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:45,154
He never speaks at all.

322
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,824
But he relives it every night.

323
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:51,743
Come.

324
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,323
Let's find your mother.

325
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:03,245
When I grow up,
I want to be a great hero like you.

326
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:06,207
- Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

327
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,460
I know all your Labors.

328
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,386
Like the Cretan Bull, you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights.

329
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,619
Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

330
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:16,469
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

331
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:20,223
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

332
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,386
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt,

333
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:25,769
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

334
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,647
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.

335
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,528
- Mother.
- Arius.

336
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,867
You're supposed to be in bed.

337
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,870
Why are you in the hospice?

338
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,909
My mother <i>saves</i> people's lives.

339
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:52,954
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

340
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:56,210
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

341
00:25:57,915 --> 00:25:59,132
If I could be like you,

342
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,466
I would protect all of Thrace
and no one would ever get hurt.

343
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:13,436
Here.

344
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:17,557
I was going to give this
to someone else,

345
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:21,023
but I never got the chance.

346
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:24,734
Only a hero may wear this.

347
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:27,783
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

348
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,117
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

349
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,497
- It is.
- Thank you.

350
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:37,616
Thank you.

351
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:38,742
Good night.

352
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:41,248
Good night, Hercules.

353
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,420
Have no fear.

354
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:53,221
If you fall in the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to Elysium,

355
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,508
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

356
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,934
like Theseus.

357
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:00,183
Odysseus!

358
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:02,345
And the great Achilles.

359
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:06,353
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

360
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:15,943
Lolaus.

361
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:18,279
Your place is beside Lord Cotys,
where it's safe.

362
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:21,445
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

363
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,051
You're a storyteller, not a warrior.

364
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:24,197
We share the same blood.

365
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:26,786
And I will not see it shed. Chariot.

366
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,200
Now.

367
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:37,716
Thracians,

368
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,508
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

369
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,882
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

370
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,805
When you fight, the wall is your armor.

371
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,637
The shield wall will
never break formation

372
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,563
as long as there is breath in your body.

373
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,266
Remember these words,

374
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,276
and you will taste victory.

375
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,695
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

376
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:12,787
Halt!

377
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:14,539
Halt!

378
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,917
- Halt!
- Halt!

379
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,236
We are too late.

380
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:53,076
Rhesus has already been here.

381
00:29:56,824 --> 00:29:59,828
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

382
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:29,046
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

383
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,087
I hate being right all the time.

384
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:39,717
Halt.

385
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,346
- Halt!
- Halt!

386
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,124
This head is rotting.

387
00:30:54,262 --> 00:30:55,605
A week old, at least.

388
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,359
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

389
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:17,809
Uncle!

390
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:29,793
And we've walked into a trap.

391
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:40,389
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! lolaus, go!

392
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:42,141
Shield wall!

393
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:54,321
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

394
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,943
This is Rhesus' doing.

395
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:58,525
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

396
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:01,319
Turn comrades against each other.

397
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,369
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

398
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,840
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

399
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:27,092
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

400
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,684
That's comforting.

401
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,315
I think he wants a challenge.

402
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:04,005
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

403
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:06,416
Lethal to anyone but him!

404
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:10,298
Watch!

405
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:23,721
Did you see that?

406
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:25,230
The gods fight on our side!

407
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,895
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

408
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,813
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

409
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,607
Hercules! Hercules!

410
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:38,526
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

411
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:54,251
Battle position!

412
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,679
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

413
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:41,996
Stand fast!

414
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:59,226
Hold your position!

415
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,342
Do not yield!

416
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,711
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

417
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:11,546
Hold the lines!

418
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,298
Do not yield!

419
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:15,971
Defend Lord Cotys!

420
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:43,261
The wall has been breached!

421
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,540
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend Lord Cotys!

422
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:56,951
Whip!

423
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,279
Hercules!

424
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,239
Bring the chariots!

425
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,872
Defend your Lord!

426
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,053
No!

427
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:45,525
Advance!

428
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,402
Advance!

429
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,851
Make way!

430
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:20,617
Where is Rhesus?

431
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,016
Lord Cotys.

432
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,019
We came here to save this village,

433
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,938
but, no, they killed half my army.

434
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,269
Rhesus.

435
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,563
This is all his doing.

436
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,898
And yours.

437
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,568
I warned you.

438
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,402
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

439
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,942
Give me time to make warriors.

440
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,157
Very well.

441
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:15,669
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

442
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:48,383
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay to seal the wound.

443
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,340
This is extract of lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

444
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:56,017
It should rest you after consuming it.
It may have certain side effects.

445
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,139
I don't need it.

446
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:01,477
Ah, forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

447
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:05,776
And, uh,
your lion's hide is indestructible?

448
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:09,528
Drink, son of Zeus.

449
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:16,117
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

450
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:17,444
Where is he now?

451
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:21,744
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

452
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:22,869
I'm sorry.

453
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:25,118
I never knew my father.

454
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,709
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

455
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:35,300
Tell me about Arius.

456
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,969
Oh. He's a good boy.

457
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:40,971
And someday, he will make a fine king.

458
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,631
Do you have any children?

459
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,060
Do they live in Athens?

460
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,646
Thank you for your care.

461
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:02,427
The sedative will help you rest.

462
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:35,199
It happened
again, didn't it, hmm?

463
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:39,532
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

464
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:42,827
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

465
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,371
There's a word for that. Madness.

466
00:44:47,037 --> 00:44:48,880
When we were driven from Athens,

467
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:51,458
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi
on your behalf.

468
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:53,339
Do you remember her prophecy?

469
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,509
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

470
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:00,220
And what is that, Hercules?

471
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:03,885
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

472
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:06,054
I speak from experience.

473
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:09,814
No matter how far you run, no matter
how fast you go, the beast will follow.

474
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,772
Man cannot escape his fate.

475
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:31,159
Room for one more in your company?

476
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:35,795
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change.

477
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,544
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

478
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:41,125
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

479
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,710
Both can satisfy in different ways.

480
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:50,971
You're a famed storyteller, lolaus.
Grace me with a story.

481
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,053
Any particular subject, My Lady?

482
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:58,098
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

483
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:03,937
Is it true?
Did Hercules slaughter his own family?

484
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:06,571
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

485
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:09,824
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

486
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:11,866
King Eurystheus will have him executed.

487
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:20,200
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

488
00:46:20,282 --> 00:46:23,001
No myths. I want the truth.

489
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,832
No one knows the truth.

490
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:27,292
Not for sure.

491
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:32,718
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, Megara and the children, dead.

492
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,136
He remembers nothing.

493
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,588
Do you believe he is innocent?

494
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:42,845
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

495
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:46,430
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

496
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:51,484
Hercules' strength set him apart.

497
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,276
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

498
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,354
The Twelve Labors.

499
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,148
And he took me with him.

500
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,741
To fight by his side.

501
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:03,698
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

502
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:08,290
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

503
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:11,037
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

504
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:13,870
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

505
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:15,829
He became my brother-in-arms.

506
00:47:16,788 --> 00:47:19,462
Thebes, the city of corpses,

507
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,963
where we found a single child,

508
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:23,961
still alive.

509
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:26,755
Hercules took Tydeus in when

510
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:29,512
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

511
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:34,137
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

512
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,472
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

513
00:47:36,555 --> 00:47:39,729
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal.

514
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:42,356
So we played along.

515
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:46,768
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus. It's good.

516
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:48,065
Scares the enemy.

517
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:49,855
Lolaus helps.

518
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:51,688
He talks nice.

519
00:47:53,674 --> 00:47:56,678
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

520
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:58,220
The truth,

521
00:48:00,763 --> 00:48:02,686
whatever the truth,

522
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:05,692
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

523
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:08,320
Only the gods can help him,

524
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,318
if he listens.

525
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:21,369
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

526
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:24,450
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

527
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,877
Zeus' master ironsmith,

528
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:29,255
using the forges of your own citadel,

529
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:33,880
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

530
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,135
As steel is hewn into shields,

531
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:39,679
so, too, will you be hewn into warriors.

532
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:45,969
You shall carry the shield of Hercules!

533
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,647
It's lighter.

534
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:58,650
Infused with the souls
of Stymphalian birds

535
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,572
from Hercules' sixth Labor!

536
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,950
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

537
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,787
Well, much as birds take flight,

538
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,491
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air. It's in the fibers. Here.

539
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:14,576
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

540
00:49:21,706 --> 00:49:23,333
It covers my whole face.

541
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:28,051
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

542
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:31,632
You sure it wasn't your horseshit
that frightened Geryon to death?

543
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,387
Mmm?

544
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:35,434
General Sitacles,

545
00:49:35,593 --> 00:49:38,767
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

546
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:55,409
Leather armor?

547
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:57,153
Mmm?

548
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:00,039
We will be skewered like pigs.

549
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:05,167
Linothorax.

550
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:09,585
Hewn from the skin of
the Erymanthean Boar.

551
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:11,544
It's indestructible.

552
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,220
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

553
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:22,342
He used an indestructible blade.

554
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:44,155
One, two.

555
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:53,333
Get up.

556
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:55,660
Next!

557
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,010
Again!

558
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:06,804
Both eyes open.

559
00:51:08,963 --> 00:51:10,135
Keep practicing.

560
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:14,142
Firmer grip.

561
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,310
Elbow up.

562
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,680
Good.

563
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,439
Shield wall! Form!

564
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:27,742
Stand tall.

565
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:31,528
Excellent.

566
00:51:58,004 --> 00:51:59,847
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

567
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,218
Again!

568
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:12,983
Rhesus is here.

569
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:15,403
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

570
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,732
What did you see?

571
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:20,024
Centaurs. Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

572
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:22,735
He saw shadows in the night.

573
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,244
My Lord,
I will go ahead into the Rhesus camp.

574
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:28,072
I will bring word of his plans.

575
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:35,419
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall.

576
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,708
You want to stop Rhesus?

577
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:39,794
We'll go through the forest
and they'll never see us coming.

578
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:42,922
It'll slow down our chariots. A gamble.

579
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:44,919
I have a plan.

580
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:50,966
The scouts have returned.

581
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:54,727
Rhesus has made his camp
in Mount Asticus, 72 leagues away.

582
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:57,350
Once these men are ready, we march.

583
00:52:58,848 --> 00:53:01,601
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

584
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:05,396
The gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter.

585
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,355
What they have told me is that

586
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:10,361
I'm soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

587
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,364
When will you die?

588
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:16,826
Within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell.

589
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:21,122
As always,
the gods are generous with hints,

590
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:23,377
but cheap on specifics.

591
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,338
Cheer up, Hercules.

592
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:31,467
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

593
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,838
I'm ready for what's next.

594
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:44,519
Thracians, halt!

595
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:47,976
Shield wall! Form!

596
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:53,394
Battle positions!

597
00:53:56,937 --> 00:53:58,280
Tydeus?

598
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:45,779
There is no enemy camp.

599
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:48,695
This is the right place.

600
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:07,714
Centaurs!

601
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:09,799
They're real.

602
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:35,320
It seems that we're expected.

603
00:55:50,741 --> 00:55:51,913
Centaurs?

604
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,266
Rhesus!

605
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:18,809
You have come looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

606
00:56:20,183 --> 00:56:22,527
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

607
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:25,187
Your legend ends here.

608
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:26,272
Look at me.

609
00:56:27,606 --> 00:56:28,778
Do I look afraid?

610
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,254
It is over, Cotys.

611
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,045
Mount Asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

612
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:42,676
And my troops outman you three to one.

613
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:48,093
Surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful.

614
00:56:48,255 --> 00:56:50,758
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

615
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:58,856
You've made your choice.

616
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:15,695
Go!

617
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:30,671
In this moment, on this day,

618
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:34,215
become the man you were born to be!

619
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:39,220
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

620
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,640
Let it be to death or victory!

621
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:49,432
Charge!

622
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,231
Shield wall!

623
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:02,192
Flanks out!

624
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:12,918
Maybe today.

625
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:35,642
Now!

626
00:58:54,861 --> 00:58:57,205
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

627
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,748
Silence, boy!

628
00:59:03,953 --> 00:59:05,455
Spears forward!

629
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:25,809
Archers, ready!

630
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,435
Loose!

631
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,101
Advance!

632
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:31,860
Set them aflame!

633
01:00:36,822 --> 01:00:37,994
Take cover!

634
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:40,667
Defend Lord Cotys!

635
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:01,517
Maybe not.

636
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:03,599
Shield wall! Attack!

637
01:01:07,306 --> 01:01:08,683
Push forward!

638
01:01:22,486 --> 01:01:25,330
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

639
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:44,297
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

640
01:01:44,796 --> 01:01:46,924
It is not over yet!

641
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,621
Fucking centaurs.

642
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,134
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

643
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:37,096
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

644
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:39,634
Hail, Lord Cotys!

645
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,208
Halt!

646
01:03:15,164 --> 01:03:16,507
Get up.

647
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,960
Get up.

648
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:27,516
- Up.
- Enough!

649
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:41,023
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

650
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,273
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

651
01:03:44,355 --> 01:03:45,777
I burned no villages.

652
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:47,783
Then who did?

653
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:50,114
Ask yourself, if Cotys is beloved,

654
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,434
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

655
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,992
Keep moving, dog.

656
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:57,121
You've been fighting on the wrong side.

657
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,358
Where are you going?

658
01:04:32,437 --> 01:04:34,439
I'm taking some water to the prisoner.

659
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:37,908
Sit down.

660
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:44,990
It's time.

661
01:04:55,164 --> 01:04:58,088
Thrace is finally united.

662
01:05:00,669 --> 01:05:01,921
One land,

663
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:03,847
one King,

664
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,013
one Thrace.

665
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,510
One land!

666
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:11,896
One King! One Thrace!

667
01:05:12,054 --> 01:05:14,853
Thrace is not a man, a king, or a god!

668
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:16,850
Thrace is her people!

669
01:05:24,231 --> 01:05:26,780
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

670
01:05:26,858 --> 01:05:28,485
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

671
01:05:40,578 --> 01:05:41,875
Don't do anything foolish.

672
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,586
Where are you going?

673
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:55,094
I saw pity in your eyes for Rhesus.

674
01:05:55,507 --> 01:05:56,804
Why?

675
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:58,600
Look at me.

676
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:01,061
Cotys is responsible for this war,
isn't he?

677
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:08,895
You lie very well.
Clearly, your father's daughter.

678
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:13,444
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

679
01:06:14,356 --> 01:06:18,702
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted
in any way, Arius would be executed.

680
01:06:18,902 --> 01:06:22,247
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

681
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,791
My husband was king.

682
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:28,331
And Cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

683
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,538
Rhesus fought back. Civil war broke out.

684
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:34,423
Arius is the legitimate king.

685
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,259
My father is old.

686
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:41,797
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

687
01:06:41,962 --> 01:06:44,932
my son will be a good king.

688
01:06:45,925 --> 01:06:48,144
And he will heal this land.

689
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:49,469
That's a dream.

690
01:06:51,262 --> 01:06:52,855
And you can help.

691
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,935
Please, when you leave Thrace,
take Arius with you.

692
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,817
Please keep him safe.

693
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,229
Find another savior.

694
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:01,812
Hercules?

695
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:05,946
The King commands your presence.

696
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,747
My Lady.

697
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,126
Ah, champion of Thrace!

698
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,345
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

699
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:32,096
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

700
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:37,427
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

701
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:39,600
You betrayed me, Cotys.

702
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:41,430
Betrayed?

703
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:46,477
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

704
01:07:46,558 --> 01:07:48,981
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

705
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,397
Let's not quibble about details.

706
01:07:56,275 --> 01:08:00,405
We all know your legend, Hercules.
But here is mine.

707
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,244
When I was a general
in the army of Thrace,

708
01:08:03,323 --> 01:08:05,997
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

709
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,374
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

710
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:12,297
I now crave an empire.

711
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:17,587
My thousands will train more thousands,
and they even more.

712
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:19,762
The <i>lessons</i> of Hercules will spread.

713
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,594
What you began here
can never be stopped.

714
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:26,726
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

715
01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:29,346
then lead it.

716
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:36,526
You want me to serve you?

717
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:40,070
Spare me the moral outrage.

718
01:08:41,147 --> 01:08:42,399
Child killer.

719
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:48,028
Getting us all killed, bad idea.

720
01:08:51,947 --> 01:08:55,417
Well, I must take this as a "no."

721
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:57,744
In that case,

722
01:08:59,412 --> 01:09:01,790
your services are no longer required.

723
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:08,845
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

724
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:54,255
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

725
01:09:57,752 --> 01:09:59,004
Take mine, too.

726
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,558
What do you think you're doing?
Let's go.

727
01:10:05,425 --> 01:10:07,348
There will be no more innocent blood
on my hands.

728
01:10:07,427 --> 01:10:09,930
I can't leave without setting this right.

729
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,023
Oh, I see.

730
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:16,399
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

731
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:17,852
Thrace needs our help.

732
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:19,942
To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

733
01:10:21,106 --> 01:10:22,186
You remember the Black Sea.

734
01:10:22,273 --> 01:10:26,198
That beach you spoke of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

735
01:10:28,654 --> 01:10:30,531
I would never be free.

736
01:10:33,574 --> 01:10:35,622
In this fight, you're alone.

737
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,338
Never saw that one coming.

738
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:42,577
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

739
01:10:42,665 --> 01:10:44,633
- Why not?
- It's all right.

740
01:10:45,126 --> 01:10:48,596
You've sacrificed your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

741
01:10:48,753 --> 01:10:50,801
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

742
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:52,557
Debt?

743
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,807
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

744
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,313
Look around, Hercules.

745
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:01,724
We're family.

746
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,142
All we have is each other.

747
01:11:06,102 --> 01:11:09,481
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time, we will die for you.

748
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:11,527
Because you would die for us.

749
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,327
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

750
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:18,491
This is madness.

751
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,073
You want madness?

752
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:23,455
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

753
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:28,167
Is that not the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

754
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,423
Crazy. The lot of you.

755
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,183
Autolycus.

756
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,804
Lolaus. Go with Autolycus.

757
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:48,846
I think I'll stay.

758
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,014
Nephew.

759
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:55,236
Uncle, all I've ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others.

760
01:11:56,728 --> 01:12:01,154
It's time I stopped telling their stories.
Started living my own.

761
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:05,202
Well, you may have all
completely lost your minds, but not me.

762
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:08,037
Not me.

763
01:12:11,406 --> 01:12:12,407
Autolycus?

764
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,042
Live like a king, my friend.

765
01:12:28,046 --> 01:12:29,343
What about Cotys?

766
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:34,468
He paid us to save Thrace.

767
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:36,018
Let's not disappoint him.

768
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,128
Lay down your arms.

769
01:13:08,996 --> 01:13:10,589
Lay down your arms!

770
01:13:11,415 --> 01:13:14,259
Or your nephew dies first.

771
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:34,111
I invite you to join me. You refuse.

772
01:13:34,268 --> 01:13:37,442
I order you to leave. You return.

773
01:13:37,604 --> 01:13:40,198
Get your hands off me.

774
01:13:42,108 --> 01:13:45,237
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

775
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,447
They were planning to remove
the young Prince from your protection.

776
01:13:54,118 --> 01:13:55,119
No.

777
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:58,126
Let go of him! Don't touch him!

778
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:03,584
Arius! No!

779
01:14:08,005 --> 01:14:09,803
No! You're hurting him! No!

780
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:12,304
Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

781
01:14:12,466 --> 01:14:15,310
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

782
01:14:15,469 --> 01:14:17,312
Arius! No!

783
01:15:04,344 --> 01:15:06,722
Magnificent, aren't they?

784
01:15:08,096 --> 01:15:11,942
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

785
01:15:12,684 --> 01:15:14,732
As long as they're fed.

786
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:17,481
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

787
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,033
They remember you.

788
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:24,278
Confused, Hercules?

789
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:30,204
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

790
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,127
King Eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

791
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,800
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

792
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,382
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

793
01:15:50,883 --> 01:15:52,885
I didn't quite catch that.

794
01:15:55,053 --> 01:15:56,396
The wolves.

795
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,983
They were there that night.

796
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,602
<i>The wolves were there.</i>

797
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:05,403
<i>You drugged me.</i>

798
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:24,750
<i>The wolves were there
the night my family was murdered.</i>

799
01:16:28,665 --> 01:16:31,259
My men told me
how your children screamed

800
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,970
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

801
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:40,429
As their fangs despoiled your daughter's

802
01:16:41,259 --> 01:16:42,306
pure flesh.

803
01:16:43,844 --> 01:16:47,314
When the people called out your name
louder than mine,

804
01:16:47,389 --> 01:16:50,768
you see, when they saw you <i>as</i> a god,

805
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:53,069
how long before
they saw you as their king?

806
01:16:53,227 --> 01:16:54,649
I wanted nothing!

807
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:58,361
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

808
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,989
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

809
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:03,911
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

810
01:17:06,196 --> 01:17:08,699
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

811
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:10,875
I had to ruin your name.

812
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:16,379
My Wife!

813
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:19,128
My children!

814
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:22,135
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

815
01:17:22,293 --> 01:17:26,469
All of you!
Starting with my faithless daughter!

816
01:17:27,213 --> 01:17:29,215
No! Get off me!

817
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:32,139
No! No! No!

818
01:17:32,302 --> 01:17:34,771
Unhand me! No!

819
01:17:35,304 --> 01:17:36,772
She's your own flesh and blood!

820
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,308
I will raise Arius to be
my worthy successor!

821
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:43,945
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

822
01:17:44,145 --> 01:17:47,615
- You are a monster! You are a monster!
- No!

823
01:17:48,273 --> 01:17:49,274
You are not a man!

824
01:17:49,483 --> 01:17:51,611
You're a demon!

825
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:53,444
Who are you?

826
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,453
Are you a murderer?

827
01:17:55,613 --> 01:17:58,116
Damn you! I curse you!

828
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:00,659
Are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent?

829
01:18:00,825 --> 01:18:02,452
Stay away from my son!

830
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:04,059
Are you only the legend?

831
01:18:04,162 --> 01:18:07,837
Or are you the truth behind the legend?

832
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:09,625
No! Father, please, please, please.

833
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,268
We believe in you.

834
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,590
We have faith in you.

835
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:15,676
Have faith in yourself.

836
01:18:15,838 --> 01:18:17,055
Save me!

837
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,848
Remember the man
that you are.

838
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:22,386
Father, the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

839
01:18:22,552 --> 01:18:24,805
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

840
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,290
the Labors you have accomplished!

841
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:28,231
No! No!

842
01:18:29,183 --> 01:18:30,605
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

843
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:32,769
Now, tell me!

844
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:33,853
Please!

845
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:36,697
Who are you?

846
01:18:36,855 --> 01:18:40,860
I am Hercules!

847
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:53,378
Unleash the wolves!

848
01:18:57,915 --> 01:18:58,916
Get away!

849
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:00,421
Ahh!

850
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:10,722
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

851
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:14,016
Ahh!

852
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:15,438
Hurry!

853
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:22,936
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

854
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,573
No!

855
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:40,084
Ahh!

856
01:19:54,045 --> 01:19:56,343
The gods have revealed your innocence.

857
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:58,850
The final Labor is complete.

858
01:19:59,008 --> 01:20:01,102
But I'm just getting started.

859
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:11,333
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

860
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,178
My time.

861
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:55,815
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

862
01:20:55,972 --> 01:20:57,394
You're welcome.

863
01:21:10,234 --> 01:21:12,578
I'm going after Eurystheus!

864
01:21:34,838 --> 01:21:36,966
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

865
01:21:37,049 --> 01:21:39,552
You see, Cotys poisoned my mind.

866
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:41,807
Turned me against you.

867
01:21:41,886 --> 01:21:42,887
I like you.

868
01:21:43,304 --> 01:21:44,351
No, stop.

869
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:48,021
I command you to stop! I'm your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

870
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:50,436
You swore to Zeus!

871
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:51,520
Wait, wait, wait.

872
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:56,149
You fight for gold. I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

873
01:21:56,857 --> 01:21:59,076
Find it in your heart to forgive.

874
01:22:04,531 --> 01:22:06,408
You want forgiveness?

875
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:24,882
Ask my family for forgiveness.

876
01:22:43,521 --> 01:22:45,615
I've never killed a god before.

877
01:22:55,614 --> 01:22:57,742
I really think I'm ready to fight now.

878
01:23:02,245 --> 01:23:03,622
Well done, warrior.

879
01:23:15,673 --> 01:23:17,391
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

880
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,598
- We need to find Arius.
- Follow me.

881
01:23:34,564 --> 01:23:36,111
Soldiers of Thrace!

882
01:23:36,274 --> 01:23:39,904
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

883
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,162
Don't be fools!

884
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:45,370
Hercules is mortal! Not a god!

885
01:23:46,115 --> 01:23:49,745
Anyone who sides with him will die!

886
01:23:50,953 --> 01:23:52,921
And I will show you.

887
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:54,623
Bring him.

888
01:23:58,626 --> 01:24:00,378
- Arius!
- Mama!

889
01:24:00,544 --> 01:24:02,922
No! He's your grandson!

890
01:24:03,464 --> 01:24:06,217
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

891
01:24:06,299 --> 01:24:08,393
But you may yet save him.

892
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:09,598
Please, Father! No!

893
01:24:10,094 --> 01:24:11,641
Admit defeat!

894
01:24:12,262 --> 01:24:13,639
Bow to me!

895
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:17,811
You have until the count of three!

896
01:24:20,311 --> 01:24:21,984
One!

897
01:24:23,022 --> 01:24:24,023
Two!

898
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,865
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

899
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:32,155
Protect Lord Cotys!

900
01:24:35,324 --> 01:24:36,496
Arius, run!

901
01:24:36,616 --> 01:24:37,663
Mother!

902
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:39,994
Get the boy!

903
01:25:20,695 --> 01:25:22,413
Ahh!

904
01:25:33,706 --> 01:25:35,208
Tydeus!

905
01:25:38,544 --> 01:25:40,512
Attack!

906
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:42,464
Hold them back!

907
01:25:58,185 --> 01:25:59,607
Spears!

908
01:26:05,107 --> 01:26:06,450
Go through the fire!

909
01:26:12,322 --> 01:26:15,166
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

910
01:26:18,952 --> 01:26:20,374
Easy, Tydeus.

911
01:26:51,313 --> 01:26:52,360
Hercules.

912
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:14,842
Lock shields!

913
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,547
March!

914
01:27:19,796 --> 01:27:21,548
Find peace, my brother.

915
01:27:37,477 --> 01:27:42,574
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to defeat a shield wall!

916
01:27:43,315 --> 01:27:45,363
There is no way out!

917
01:27:46,484 --> 01:27:48,407
Come out and face me!

918
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:59,212
You're no hero! You're no god!

919
01:27:59,537 --> 01:28:02,336
You're nothing but a mercenary!

920
01:28:02,498 --> 01:28:05,217
Your wife and children deserved to die!

921
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:28,861
What're you doing?

922
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:30,739
Get back up there!

923
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:33,524
Hercules must die!

924
01:28:36,318 --> 01:28:37,786
Come on!

925
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:43,250
Kill that filthy bastard!

926
01:29:43,124 --> 01:29:45,843
Hercules! Hercules!

927
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,930
Hercules! Hercules!

928
01:29:50,089 --> 01:29:55,391
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

929
01:29:55,468 --> 01:29:59,143
Hercules! Hercules!

930
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:04,304
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

931
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:12,282
<i>You want to know
the truth about Hercules?</i>

932
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:14,280
<i>There it is.</i>

933
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:18,614
<i>To be honest, I prefer it to the legend.</i>

934
01:30:19,321 --> 01:30:22,495
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

935
01:30:23,283 --> 01:30:26,332
<i>Is he actually the son of Zeus?</i>

936
01:30:26,994 --> 01:30:29,338
<i>I don't think it really matters.</i>

937
01:30:29,997 --> 01:30:33,217
<i>You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.</i>

938
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:36,671
<i>You just need to believe you're a hero.</i>

939
01:30:37,002 --> 01:30:39,505
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

940
01:30:41,132 --> 01:30:45,308
<i>But then again, what the hell do I know?</i>

941
01:30:46,177 --> 01:30:48,680
<i>I'm supposed to be dead by now.</i>
