1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,754
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,047
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,634
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,137
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,598
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,725
But by night, I am someone else.

7
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,935
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,313
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,065
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,210
Susan Williams.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

11
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,154
Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,241
of what's going on
within his own administration.

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,658
You give me one month with no attacks.

14
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,952
- Let me show you what I can do.
- One month.

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,439
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

16
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,248
- Why would I need that?
- I think you can figure it out.

17
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:42,793
- What are you doing in Russia?
- I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,837
Tell me if you can get me close to him.

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,131
All right. But the only way will kill you.

20
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,759
I have no family. I have no home.

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,469
I have no name.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,474
You got much worse coming.
He calls himself Prometheus,

23
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,601
and he's gonna end you.

24
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,813
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give you his name.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,398
It's Oliver Queen.

26
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,191
What's the status on Church's cell phone?

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,972
It's holding still
at Aparo and Puckett.

28
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,658
This is one well-traveled phone
considering its owner was killed

29
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,206
on the other side of town last week.

30
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,019
Prometheus is trying to bait me.

31
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,164
Yeah. That's the general point
I was trying to convey.

32
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,274
And also that this is probably a trap.

33
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,126
You should've let me
call in the rest of the team.

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,610
- No.
- Why?

35
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,363
Because it's probably a trap.

36
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,497
We've got this, Overwatch.

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,159
Who is this?

38
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:43,080
It's a lot of trouble to go to
for a prank.

39
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,934
"And so it begins"?

40
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,604
Who knew Prometheus was
a Babylon 5 fan-boy?

41
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,606
Don't judge until you've seen it.

42
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,917
- So what begins, that's the question?
- That's a good point.

43
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,981
It would seem like he's already started,
considering he's dropped two bodies.

44
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,114
I get killing Conahan, he led the ACU team

45
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,867
to help the Green Arrow
rescue the city councilmen.

46
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:23,287
- But why take out Church?
- According to Detective Malone

47
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:26,054
it's because Church got in between
Prometheus and his real target.

48
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,416
- The Green Arrow.
- Yes.

49
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,961
So Church goes after you,
Prometheus goes after Church, and shunk!

50
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,682
What? That was my
throwing star sound effect.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,240
- Why? What does yours sound like?
- I just don't understand,

52
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,387
a person that leaves a trail of dead cops

53
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,282
just to kill a guy who's after you
because he wants to kill you himself.

54
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,474
Well, I'll say it again.

55
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,911
It's serious enough to warrant telling
the rest of the recruits.

56
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,770
Who? Curtis and three people
we barely know?

57
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,772
One of which gave up your identity
to Church,

58
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,376
who we can only pray didn't share
that information with Prometheus.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,319
Well, for the record,
Rene didn't "give up" Oliver's identity.

60
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,654
Okay? He was tortured.

61
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,757
That's exactly
why we have to keep them out of this.

62
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,501
I don't wanna put the recruits
in harm's way

63
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,827
until we know exactly what it is
we're dealing with.

64
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,001
Okay, once your wire is attached... Good.

65
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,504
Now take the other one
and attach to battery

66
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,506
and the other one to the igniter.

67
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,175
I failed chemistry in high school.

68
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,512
- Twice.
- Then learn like I did, in,

69
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,515
- how you say, school of hard knock?
- I don't see the point of this.

70
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:28,436
I'm here in Russia
to take out Konstantin Kovar.

71
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,354
Not to learn how to make a bomb.

72
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,190
You must be like sponge, Oliver.

73
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,944
Making bomb, working with electronics,
welding metal.

74
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,447
Bratva spend off hours
learning many trade.

75
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,614
Fine.

76
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,492
Attach one into igniter,
other one to battery terminal.

77
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,661
Careful, do not touch circuit board.

78
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,375
Oops.

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,835
Get back!

80
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,428
It's okay, Oliver.

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,555
First time I try, I nearly lose finger.

82
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,992
What the hell was that?

83
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,536
Declaration of war against Bratva.

84
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,705
- By who?
- Your friend.

85
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,332
Kovar.

86
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,252
I'm proud of our new zoning ordinance.

87
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,047
Along with the work
that's being done by the ACU.

88
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,924
Our citizens need to feel safe,

89
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,176
but they also need homes and jobs.

90
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,429
Thank you for joining us.

91
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,348
I, uh, overslept.

92
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,434
- What're you gonna do? Dock my pay?
- No, no, it's just...

93
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,728
It's not the first time
it's happened this week.

94
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,939
Is there something you wanna tell me?

95
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,775
If that's code for
"are you still drinking"

96
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,111
then my answer hasn't changed
since the last 50 times you asked me.

97
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,958
What the hell's he doing talking with her?

98
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,615
It was his idea.

99
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,146
She rakes him over the coals
about making me deputy mayor,

100
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,095
- and now he gives her an interview?
- I think we're done.

101
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,400
For all accounts, she's actually
going pretty easy on him.

102
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,790
Great.

103
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,436
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Thank you for giving me a chance

104
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,045
to explain my side of the issues.

105
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,131
Well, I said I'd give you a month
without any negative headlines.

106
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,466
Clock's ticking.

107
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,152
And it's ticking on the other thing, too.

108
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,594
Right, um, the...

109
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,471
Tick-tock, Mr. Mayor.

110
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,889
Ready?

111
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,312
You were not actually flirting
with that woman.

112
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,565
She can literally ruin your career.

113
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,276
I haven't done anything yet.

114
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,153
- Wow.
- I hate that he just said "yet."

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,573
Okay, come on.
There's something I wanna show you.

116
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,495
- What is this?
- This is a music and arts festival.

117
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,222
Seattle's been hosting one for decades.

118
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,167
I mean, they are great for publicity,
and tourism, tax revenue...

119
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,088
Except, revenue is what you're gonna need
to pull that off and we don't have revenue

120
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,215
- to pull that off.
- Yes, we do, because

121
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,926
the mayor's chief of staff
is a former nightclub owner.

122
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,721
And all the right people
still owe me the right favors, so...

123
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,168
I mean, I may not be able to get
all of these bands there,

124
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,303
but enough to draw a crowd.

125
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,685
Well, Speedy, this is, this is good work.

126
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,688
Well, I... I still need a venue.

127
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,500
Let's put together a list, I'll make
whatever calls you need me to make.

128
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,525
Okay.

129
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,445
Actually, I might have an "in"
at the Rockets Arena.

130
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,863
Deputy Mayor Lance.

131
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,907
Hold off on giving me keys to the city.
I just know a guy.

132
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,660
I'm just trying to do
whatever I can to help.

133
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,370
Thank you.

134
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,354
Please... Please...

135
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,773
Take whatever you want! Just don't...

136
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,483
I have two children.

137
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,187
Could we get the room for a minute?

138
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,444
Neat trick. Must come in handy when
you lock yourself out of your place.

139
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,905
I'm Adrian Chase. I'm the new DA.

140
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,866
I thought crime scenes
were below a D.A.'s pay grade.

141
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,452
I'm not that kind of D.A.

142
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,162
What's your excuse for being here?

143
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,540
Radio call mentioned the murder weapon.

144
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,334
Like Church and Lieutenant Conahan.

145
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,253
What do you have on the victim?

146
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,587
Gay Eked.

147
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,798
Divorced mother of two.
And before you ask,

148
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,676
her ex has an airtight alibi
and Mrs. Eked's criminality

149
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,970
is limited to three parking tickets.

150
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,139
What do you know that I don't?

151
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,978
The killer calls himself Prometheus.

152
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,690
And why would this Prometheus
target an average housewife?

153
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,029
Another body just dropped.

154
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,449
Another throwing star murder.

155
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,911
Peter Meld, 38, cab driver.

156
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,764
He was killed
while filling his taxi up with gas.

157
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,373
Oliver's headed to the crime scene now.

158
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,209
Okay. Any connection
between Meld and Gay Eked?

159
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,087
Just the same M.O.,
killed by a throwing star.

160
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,672
Hmm.

161
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,427
You know, Felicity, it sure would be nice
to get our hands on one.

162
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,678
Yeah.

163
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,014
What?

164
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,617
- Why're you looking at me like that?
- I'm not the one dating

165
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,727
- a detective.
- Oh. No. Well, Billy doesn't know

166
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,037
that I work with the Green Arrow.

167
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,381
I'm not crazy about overlapping
my work and personal lives.

168
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,917
And even if I was, what am I
supposed to do, steal it off his desk?

169
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,669
Felicity, you're one of the
smartest people I know.

170
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,111
I'm sure you'll think of something.

171
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,114
Four bodies so far. Let's do
whatever we can to make sure

172
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,426
- it doesn't become number five.
- Ah, that sounds like an argument

173
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,035
in favor of looping in the recruits.

174
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,454
When there's a reason to, we will.

175
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,499
This is the reason, we should do it now.

176
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,378
- What'd you find?
- Nothing but the victim's blood.

177
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,464
No fibers, no shards, no prints.

178
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,400
So how the hell
are we supposed to find this guy?

179
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,884
Apparently, we're not.

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,054
Oh. You do not look happy.

181
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,473
Is it because I'm not bearing Americanos?

182
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,392
- No, it's not the coffee, it's a case.
- The throwing star killings?

183
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,840
Kind of hard to miss.
Although apparently this guy didn't.

184
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,564
Oh. That was unexpectedly morbid. Coffee?

185
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,525
Which actually brings me to why I'm here,

186
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,235
not the coffee, the morbidness.

187
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,071
I was friends with one of the victims
in your case.

188
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,478
Well, more like, acquaintances.

189
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,367
You know. Friend of a friend of a friend.

190
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,037
Is this the, uh, same "friend"
whose housekeeper got their towel stolen?

191
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,331
It wasn't a towel, it was a rag, and no.

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,625
- Totally different friend.
- Wow.

193
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,212
Another friend involved
in a random crime in the city.

194
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,380
Ooh.

195
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,298
You must run in
a pretty rough crowd.

196
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,592
You have no idea.

197
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,095
I'd have a better one
if you'd just cut the crap

198
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,989
and tell me whatever it is
you're not telling me.

199
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,348
What? There's no deception here.

200
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,715
I actually was, kind of, sort of,
friends with a victim,

201
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,143
- Gay Eked.
- "Kind of, sort of"?

202
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,229
Pike wants us in his office.

203
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,273
- We'll talk later.
- Uh...

204
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,997
Okay. So, we've got
a problem with your girlfriend.

205
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,583
- Who?
- Susan Williams.

206
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,463
Detective William Malone, who is believed
to be in charge of the investigation,

207
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,049
- could not be reached for comment.
- This is a disaster.

208
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,552
Nor has SCPD issued a statement
on the matter.

209
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,763
But it is believed that this
"Throwing Star Killer" is responsible

210
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,392
for a total of four deaths so far,
including that of reputed crime lord.

211
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,936
- Tobias Church.
- "Throwing Star Killer"?

212
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,743
You have to admit it has a certain flair.

213
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,293
I don't need
to be the one to tell you

214
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,984
that having a city-wide panic
is, like, the worst thing

215
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,045
- that can happen before this festival.
- No, Thea.

216
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,779
You don't have to tell me that.

217
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,995
Anatoly? Why didn't you tell me

218
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,456
that Kovar was making a move
against the Bratva?

219
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,292
You know he's the reason
that I'm here in the first place.

220
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,420
I told you, Kovar has army.
Who did you think his enemy was?

221
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,924
You told me I could get at Kovar
by joining the Bratva.

222
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,930
It looks like
you are going to get your chance.

223
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,095
Well, Pakhan is going to be here
any moment. He'll explain everything.

224
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,057
Tidy yourself up, show him your respect.

225
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,213
Ah. The puppy speaks.

226
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,466
The infamous Oliver Queen. What?

227
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,219
Did you think that we would
not learn of your past?

228
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,555
That we would allow rich American
into this organization

229
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,224
without special circumstances?

230
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,726
- I've earned my place here.
- So I hear.

231
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,521
So why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on!

232
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,814
Oliver, respect.

233
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,608
It's okay, Anatoly. Hmm.

234
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,736
I appreciate his eagerness.

235
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:46,535
Kovar decided to expand his territory.

236
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,079
A casino. What happened here tonight

237
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,289
is warning for us to stay away.

238
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,876
- But we're not going to do that.
- So what are we gonna do?

239
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,087
Kovar needs money to expand.

240
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,591
Investors. Like, say a rich American.

241
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,677
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,097
You can get meeting with his people.
When you do, you're gonna get inside

243
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,599
and you're going to blow
his new casino up.

244
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,269
And you thought making bomb
was waste of time.

245
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,229
What do you say, Oliver?

246
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,107
Ready to play
a rich American playboy again?

247
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,155
Your new girlfriend certainly knows
how to whip a city into a frenzy.

248
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,782
- Excuse me.
- Thea might've mentioned something about

249
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,036
- you dating Susan Williams.
- I'm not dating Susan Williams.

250
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,663
Did the person that you're dating
actually give you that?

251
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,081
No.

252
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,918
- I might've stolen it off his desk.
- Are you kidding...

253
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,148
I generally don't kid about something that
could get me 10 years at Iron Heights.

254
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:44,217
- Well, I hope it was worth it.
- Yeah, so far, not so much.

255
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
And here I was just so happy Curtis got
our gas chromatograph working again.

256
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,361
I'm hoping to have better luck with this.

257
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,309
I've plugged the four victims
into an algorithm that ViCAP uses

258
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,621
to track serial killers. The computer can
tease out connections between the victims

259
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,005
- that the FBI generally doesn't make.
- Well, that's smart.

260
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,945
And I cross-referenced in our own database
along with SCPD's to hopefully

261
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,694
get better results.

262
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,405
- What is that?
- News alert.

263
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,701
Reports are just coming in that someone
spotted the Throwing Star Killer

264
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,829
at an outdoor shopping mall,
inciting widespread panic

265
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,499
that is threatening to spill into nearby
streets and homes.

266
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,834
Well, I hope your new girlfriend
is happy with herself.

267
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,562
Let's call the team
and have them meet me there.

268
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,254
- All of them?
- All of them.

269
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,007
They deserve to know
that this has escalated.

270
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,182
And stop calling Susan Williams
my girlfriend.

271
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,844
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,284
Who the hell are those guys?

273
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,953
They're just shooting into the dark.

274
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,287
It's because they're scared.

275
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,373
Prometheus probably
isn't even here.

276
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,375
Our job here is to keep the peace.

277
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,422
Me, Spartan and Ragman
will handle the shooters.

278
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,920
Everyone else get people to safety.

279
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,047
Why's Ragman get to have all the fun?

280
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,383
Because I said so.

281
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,643
I'll never get tired of this part.

282
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,574
Oh, no! Make it stop. Please.

283
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,784
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

284
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,620
You're safe with us, okay? Come with me.

285
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,914
You saved us. Thank you.

286
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,666
It's okay.

287
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,794
That's it. Come on.

288
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,592
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

289
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,998
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Hey, man, you all right?

290
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,763
I got you. Let's get out of here.
You're safe. Come on.

291
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,564
There's no threat here. Go home.

292
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,234
He's up there! Get behind me!

293
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,410
The killer isn't here. You're safe. Go.
Move. Move. Now. Now! Go. Go!

294
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,705
Put your weapon down!

295
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,957
I've got a right to protect myself.

296
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,257
- Hey, that's my property!
- Not anymore.

297
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:33,220
The Throwing Star Killer isn't here.
All you are doing is causing panic.

298
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,389
Go home. Now.

299
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,017
This is the SCPD.

300
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,315
Please return to your homes.

301
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,824
Well, if Prometheus wanted to
push the public into a frenzy,

302
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,117
mission accomplished.

303
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,246
Well, I'm guessing
we're not gonna like his encore either.

304
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,164
I will stop helping.

305
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,411
We need to canvass the city.
Felicity can coordinate.

306
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,669
We need to help the SCPD maintain order.

307
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,964
- Hold up a sec.
- More, like, back up. Way up.

308
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,926
Yeah, tonight's the first we're hearing
of a serial killer operating in the city.

309
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,514
He calls himself Prometheus.
He's the one who killed Tobias Church.

310
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,182
Did you know about this?

311
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,768
He knew about this.
Why didn't we know about this?

312
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,521
You know about him now.
So let's get to work.

313
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,359
These throwing star killings
are some kind of message

314
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,821
that Prometheus is sending to Oliver.
He's calling him out.

315
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,406
Sounds like, and I'm guessing,

316
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,342
you and blondie have known
about this a while.

317
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,206
- Yeah, that's not insulting at all.
- Evelyn, this isn't about feelings

318
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,455
or ego. We had to vet the situation.

319
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,042
He means the A-Team had to make
sure the B-Team was worthy enough

320
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,249
of being kept in the loop.

321
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,546
All right,
the only team here is Team Arrow.

322
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,816
I actually agree with you guys.
But the whole city is going

323
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,591
- nutso crazy right now so...
- She's right.

324
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,695
- There's plenty of time for this later.
- Except for Curtis.

325
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,179
I need your brain
on this victimology algorithm.

326
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,560
- Sir.
- Victimology algorithm.

327
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,313
This is just like Zodiac.
And I'm Jake Gyllenhaal.

328
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,065
- Wait, wouldn't you be...
- Don't take this from me.

329
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,612
Ollie, where are you?

330
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,033
This place is going through
five kinds of hell right now.

331
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,749
What do we have?

332
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,418
You guys, uh, think you wanna
clear the room for us?

333
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,586
Seriously, bro?

334
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,297
Felicity and Curtis found
something, we wanna know what it is.

335
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,883
Yeah, we're a team. Or at least we were.

336
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,178
- Fine. What do we have?
- At first, not much of anything.

337
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,474
No links between home addresses,
personal histories, favorite colors, nada.

338
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:29,145
So the victimology algorithm moved on
to crazy Zodiac Killer kind of stuff.

339
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,231
Such as looking for anagrams.

340
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,608
In case Prometheus was sending a message

341
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,152
in the names of the victims
he's been choosing.

342
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,822
- Is he?
- Kind of.

343
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,911
The first four victims, Tobias Church,
Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, Gay Eked.

344
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,038
Victims three and four
were not random.

345
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:51,000
We think Prometheus is using those names
as anagrams to spell out other names.

346
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,170
Adam Hunt. Ted Gaynor.
Palmer Cokes. Sachi Beech.

347
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,172
Those names supposed to
mean anything to us?

348
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,882
They do to him.

349
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,261
Care to enlighten?

350
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,221
Those names are on the list.

351
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,224
What the hell is the list?

352
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,070
Let me get this straight,
you got a "to kill" list?

353
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,096
- And I'm the out of control one?
- I haven't used that list,

354
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,284
I haven't looked at it in four years.

355
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,036
Wait. Four years, I thought
there was some other guy in the hood?

356
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,666
No, that was Oliver. "The Hood,"
"The Arrow," "Green Arrow," all him.

357
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,044
That notebook belonged to my father.
And when I was first starting out,

358
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,464
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

359
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, I think we now know the message
Prometheus is trying to send.

360
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,303
You do? 'Cause, I don't. Do you guys?

361
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,180
He's saying you're the serial killer.

362
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,223
Harsh.

363
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,059
- But feeling pretty accurate.
- I was trying to help this city.

364
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,895
Prometheus isn't.

365
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,649
You convinced me to not get revenge
on Ruvé Darhk

366
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,987
for my parents because killing would
tarnish the Black Canary's legacy.

367
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,033
How are you anything
other than a hypocrite?

368
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,800
First, it would've tarnished her legacy.

369
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,579
Second, you knew that I was a killer
when you came on board.

370
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,749
Not a serial killer.
I know some of these names.

371
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,377
You've got bankers in here.
Lawyers. A city councilman.

372
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,006
You need to anagram the names on the list
against Star City's population.

373
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,092
Because that should point us
towards Prometheus' next targets.

374
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,808
I know it's not much to look at now,
but with your investment,

375
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,436
we can make it a premier
destination in the area.

376
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:38,775
No, look, as long as you have craps
in here. Right? I am awesome at craps.

377
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,486
You gotta fill this place with girls.

378
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,697
- Tons of girls.
- I'm sure you will be very pleased.

379
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,408
All of your requests will be accommodated.

380
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,411
I'm convinced, but my associate

381
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,780
would like to see the blueprints just
to make sure you're all buttoned up, yeah?

382
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,959
Here you are.

383
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,798
I can have copies sent to your hotel.
But first...

384
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,593
Yes.

385
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,515
- You want to see the money.
- Not to be rude, but, yes.

386
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,142
That's fine. That's fine.
Show the man the money.

387
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:24,320
This will do just fine, Mr. Queen.

388
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,573
If you don't mind my asking,

389
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,867
why you have not returned home?
Supposedly you're a big deal.

390
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,836
All right. We wanna set the charges
there and there.

391
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,714
For maximum damage. What?

392
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,884
You play, what's American term,
"douche" very well.

393
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,761
Let's get this over with.

394
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,728
What?

395
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:06,988
Quentin?

396
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,952
Are you home?

397
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,916
Quentin?

398
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,753
- What're you doing...
- God!

399
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,063
What're you doing? What are you...

400
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,356
What, are you trying
to kill me or something?

401
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,967
Where the hell have you been?
The whole city is in crisis.

402
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,678
Well, yeah, my stomach's been
on a tear since lunch. I...

403
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,724
It must have been some fish.
It was the fish. It was the damn fish.

404
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,894
Yeah. Probably didn't wash down
well with all the whiskey.

405
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,396
When did you relapse?

406
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,527
You didn't... You...

407
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,238
You've been drinking the whole time.

408
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:51,574
You lied to me.

409
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,743
Well, I'm a drunk, Thea.
That's what we do.

410
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,621
- Yeah, okay. I'm taking you to a meeting.
- Hmm.

411
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,291
You can't help a man
who doesn't wanna be helped.

412
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,796
Watch me.

413
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,925
I am not giving up on you.

414
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,595
And I'm not letting you give up
on yourself.

415
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,305
I don't think that

416
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,058
his deputy mayor
being seen at an A.A. meeting

417
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,435
is exactly what your brother needs
right now.

418
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,313
The second "A"
stands for "anonymous," right?

419
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,362
What the hell is this thing?

420
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:34,117
Oh, um, thanks. What is this?

421
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,162
Regan family schnapps recipe.
It's strong and a little sweet.

422
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,291
Just like you. I thought we could use some
considering the circumstances.

423
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,461
- Would you care for some?
- Um, Rory, she's 17.

424
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,005
So? My dad was giving me this stuff
when I was 11.

425
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,967
And what a fine weirdo
you turned out to be. Mmm.

426
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,635
Mmm.

427
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,614
Look, if this little meeting is
because we learned Oliver's a Killer,

428
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,557
I've got news for you, it's not news.

429
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,519
Look, killing Damien Darhk,
and Church's guys is one thing.

430
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,062
But having a secret kill list...

431
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,399
Yeah, that he never even told us about.
It's something completely different.

432
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,068
Well, what's not different
is him not telling us stuff.

433
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,088
Haven't you noticed when it comes to
information sharing,

434
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,632
there seems to be two different teams?

435
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,633
It's only gotten worse
since Diggle's been back.

436
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,337
Make up your mind, guys, are you pissed
because Oliver killed people

437
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,120
or that he doesn't tell us everything?

438
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,122
How about both?

439
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,184
How about I'm pissed that the guy
who only shares the important information

440
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,169
with his inner circle
used to be a serial killer?

441
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,755
Which again, he didn't tell us about.

442
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,548
Look,

443
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,092
we all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade.

444
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,676
But how are we
supposed to follow him into a battle

445
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,556
when his first instinct
is to hide the truth from us?

446
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,601
First it's "I used to be a serial killer."

447
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,519
What's tomorrow's revelation going to be?

448
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,941
I don't know how to operate
with that in the back of my mind.

449
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:01,037
Wow, haven't seen you do that
in quite some time.

450
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,748
I wanted
to take my mind off things.

451
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,152
Yeah. I don't think they make
enough tennis balls for that.

452
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,382
Where's Felicity
with the list of potential targets?

453
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,718
She's working on it. It's a big city.

454
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,886
Yeah.

455
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,475
Something tells me,
that's not the only thing weighing on you.

456
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,228
- How are the recruits?
- Taking a little time out.

457
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,815
I expected them to be upset
with me and that's fine. But...

458
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,691
John, they seemed horrified.

459
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,027
No, I wouldn't call it that.
Just a bit surprised.

460
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,488
Look on the bright side,
it does show how far you've come.

461
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,615
I haven't seen that guy in a long time.

462
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,660
And the way the kids reacted...

463
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,846
I think it proves how much you've changed.

464
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,288
Except I haven't.

465
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,125
I killed Damien Darhk,
and I haven't stopped since.

466
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,091
Yeah, well, don't forget
who you're talking to, man.

467
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,094
I know, first hand,
what it's like to be a murderer.

468
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,515
I know the difference
between a good Kill

469
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,017
and one made out of pure rage.

470
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,565
You killed Damien Darhk, Oliver,
because you had to.

471
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,401
You took down Church's men,
because you had to.

472
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,864
The list was something different.
You were targeting lawyers, stockbrokers.

473
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,283
You were Killing as a first resort,
not a last.

474
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,201
And now Prometheus is just

475
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,954
dredging all that up again.

476
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:31,335
I wanna move forward.
I'm trying to move forward. But I...

477
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,758
- I feel stuck.
- I think you're being hard on yourself.

478
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,220
Which is a bit annoying because
that's usually mine and Felicity's job.

479
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,307
But, Oliver, in that official capacity,

480
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,477
I think you are moving forward.

481
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,355
I think you're evolving.
I think you're growing.

482
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,357
What makes you so sure?

483
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,724
Because that guy with the list

484
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,819
wouldn't have even thought
to ask the question.

485
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,655
I need a cleanup on Aisle 12.

486
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,700
And, also,
I got a list of potential victims.

487
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:11,167
I know you're all upset with me.
So, thank you for showing up despite that.

488
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,211
Well, we were afraid you would Kill us
if we didn't.

489
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,797
- Too soon? Okay.
- I was able to cross-reference the list

490
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:21,052
with the city census,
nailing it down to six potential targets.

491
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,511
How do we know who he'll hit?

492
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,323
We don't. In order to cover
that much ground,

493
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:26,641
we have to split up
and each take one potential target.

494
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,393
We run surveillance. Whoever spots
Prometheus first, call it in.

495
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,020
Then we all converge.

496
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,480
Cool.

497
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,278
- Is everything okay?
- No. It's not.

498
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:43,115
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

499
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,868
That you were responsible
for leaving them to suffocate

500
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,745
in one of Damien Darhk's
testing chambers.

501
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,830
- I know.
- It took a lot

502
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,457
for me to come work with you.

503
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,376
Knowing all this,

504
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,379
it doesn't make it any easier.

505
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,548
Evelyn, are you sure
you should be out there tonight?

506
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,175
Yes, I am.

507
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:05,012
Because I'm doing this,
protecting people, for me.

508
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,139
Not for you.

509
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,376
- I've got eyes on Target Number Four.
- Copy that.

510
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,598
You know, it seems we have a minute alone,

511
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,339
- is there anything you want to talk about?
- No.

512
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,436
Are you sure? 'Cause I'm kind of an expert

513
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,177
when it comes to finding out
ugly things about Oliver's past.

514
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,680
Actually, I'm the...
I'm the leading expert.

515
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,056
- Overwatch?
- Yeah?

516
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,017
I really don't want to talk about it.

517
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,567
Oh, my God.

518
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,491
Get back!

519
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,288
- The hell?
- Get out of here! Go call 911!

520
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,874
Stay away from him!

521
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,593
- Go.
- We've got a problem.

522
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,480
Artemis seems to have
disconnected her come.

523
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,679
She in trouble?

524
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,033
I don't know, but I'm worried
she wouldn't tell us if she was.

525
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,183
Do you have her 20?

526
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,453
When Wild Dog was kidnapped,
I put trackers in all their suits.

527
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,062
I'm sending you the information now.

528
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,149
- She's moving.
- She's on a subway that's moving.

529
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,485
Train's a few blocks from here.
I'll go check on her.

530
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,451
You tell everyone else to hold
their position.

531
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,008
Hey... Hey... Come on, man.
Come on, please!

532
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,772
- You okay?
- Yeah. What the hell was that?

533
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,524
Stop the train.

534
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,400
Hey.

535
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,196
- You all right?
- I wasn't going to be.

536
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,157
- Prometheus?
- Gone.

537
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,743
Whatever he's planning,
it wasn't to engage me tonight.

538
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,537
Hey, we got a problem.

539
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,831
- We got a big problem.
- What?

540
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,297
I don't have time to disarm that.

541
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,550
We're getting off the train. Come on.

542
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,886
You're joking, right? 'Cause now's a
really bad time to be trying out jokes.

543
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,221
Trust me.

544
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,795
Good as new.

545
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,132
What's gonna happen to the train guy?

546
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,303
This morning, Mayor Queen is gonna
put him and Prometheus' five other targets

547
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,263
into witness protection
until this is over.

548
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,849
Won't Prometheus just
find another way to go after you?

549
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,017
Probably.

550
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,060
But when he does, we will deal with it.

551
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,105
And, I promise, you will find out
right when I do.

552
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,111
I was a jerk.

553
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,909
And I'm sorry.

554
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,328
No, Evelyn, I'm...

555
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:00,289
I'm sorry.

556
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,875
I'm sorry for your parents.

557
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,296
I'm sorry that I'm not the man
you thought I was.

558
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,800
But John reminded me, as he does,

559
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,347
that I'm trying to be that man.

560
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,476
And I might actually be getting there.

561
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,645
Slowly.

562
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,148
In the meantime,

563
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,525
I would really appreciate your patience.

564
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,361
Sounds reasonable to me.

565
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,371
When I was a boy

566
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,415
my mother told me
a story about her grandfather.

567
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,171
She said he grew a turnip so large
that he could not pull it up by himself.

568
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:54,051
So he asked his wife to help,
but together they could not do it.

569
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,012
So they asked my uncle,

570
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,015
my aunts, everybody to pitch in, but...

571
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,060
Yet they could not pull the turnip
out of the ground.

572
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,105
And so I said,

573
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,066
"Mama, Mama,

574
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,820
"did he ever pull the turnip
out of the ground?"

575
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,531
And she said, "Yes.

576
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,449
"But only...

577
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,036
"Only after they called everybody
in the village."

578
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,956
Every man, woman and child.

579
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:27,710
Every farmer, every vagabond.

580
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,379
Every animal even.

581
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,506
The dogs and the cats.

582
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:37,011
And finally, together,

583
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,099
they wrestled it free.

584
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,394
Does your story have a point?

585
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes.

586
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,066
That without unity

587
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:54,236
one cannot accomplish anything in life.

588
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,614
As I got older, I realized it also meant
something else.

589
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,992
That scum

590
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,911
will never amount to anything
without help.

591
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:09,126
That the Solntsevskaya Bratva
can pull at the turnip all they want.

592
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,129
But they will never, ever,

593
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,089
ever

594
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,967
set it free.

595
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:18,927
Oh.

596
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,639
Yes, that and, uh...

597
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,270
To become a damn farmer.

598
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,281
Hello,

599
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,284
Oliver Queen.

600
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,289
My name is Konstantin Kovar.

601
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,837
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

602
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,807
Hey.

603
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:09,311
Oh, so, to what latest crime or criminal
do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

604
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,438
I thoroughly deserve that.

605
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,274
Is there somewhere private we can go chat?

606
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,193
Step into my office.

607
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,491
Oh, yes, the interrogation room.
How appropriate.

608
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,202
Felicity, I was just giving you
a hard time.

609
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:29,373
I figure whenever you're ready to tell me
whatever's going on with you,

610
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,874
you'll tell me.

611
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,668
I'm gonna tell you now.

612
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,129
I have this friend.

613
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,755
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

614
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,717
Who I just watched for the umpteenth
time not tell the people

615
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,679
he's closest to what is going on with him.

616
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,598
I don't want to be like that.

617
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,560
I don't want you to be like that.

618
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,771
So, what is it, are you,
like, a serial killer?

619
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,524
Or something? The Throwing Star Killer?
A true crime groupie?

620
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,411
I've got a million scenarios running
through my mind. Like, you're...

621
00:37:58,569 --> 00:37:59,649
I work for the Green Arrow.

622
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,702
That wasn't one of 'em.

623
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,122
It's why I keep odd hours and
why I disappear at random times.

624
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,850
And it's why I keep asking you
for favors,

625
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,059
and in case you haven't noticed,

626
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,169
it's why I stole evidence off your desk.

627
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,937
You know, I looked everywhere for that.

628
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,773
It goes without saying that me
being like a criminal

629
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,437
probably isn't good for our relationship.

630
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,552
But you're not like a criminal, Felicity.
You are one.

631
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,353
But it's for a good cause.

632
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,732
Seriously? Are you not, like, mad?

633
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,568
Or hurt? Or feeling a lack of trust?

634
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,028
I'd be a jerk if I did.

635
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,446
Felicity,

636
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,158
you're helping save this city.

637
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,744
Wow, that went a lot better
than I expected.

638
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,871
I just got so many questions.

639
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,291
Do you know where he lives?
Is his face all scarred or something?

640
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,543
- Is that why he wears a hood?
- Billy, Billy, Billy.

641
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,629
Shut up.

642
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,923
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,700
- Thanks for putting this together, Speedy.
- I can't take all the credit.

644
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,477
- Lance did come up with the venue.
- Shouldn't he be here?

645
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:17,606
Oh... Yeah. He came down with that flu
that everyone's been catching,

646
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,776
- s0 he just decided to sit this one out.
- Oh. Hey!

647
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,696
Well, if it isn't my favorite chief
of staff. How are you doing?

648
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,406
Still not interested.

649
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:33,455
Ooh. It's cool, man.
Nobody saw you get completely shot down.

650
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,209
You know, 'cause we did see you get...

651
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,856
- Everything looks really nice, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you, Curtis.

652
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,257
Yeah, I can't remember the last time
I saw a concert. Or danced.

653
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,801
- Or smiled apparently.
- Okay.

654
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,408
Come on, Rory. Just follow our lead.

655
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,140
- Hey.
- Hi.

656
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,642
Can I talk to you privately?

657
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,853
Yeah. Give us a second please, guys.

658
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,874
- What's going on?
- You remember the throwing star

659
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,458
that I stole from my boyfriend. From...

660
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,878
My... From Malone? You remember the...
You remember this?

661
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,296
You said it didn't turn anything up.

662
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,073
- Pretty sure I used the word "yet."
- Okay. So, now?

663
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,909
The alloy is very specific,
with trace quantities

664
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,887
containing dozens of different
genetic markers.

665
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,871
And I was able to nail
the forensic evidence down

666
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,559
- to coming within the past four years.
- What're you trying to tell me?

667
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,626
This is gonna sound crazy,
but so is Prometheus.

668
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,146
I think that Prometheus has gotten
his hands on the various arrows

669
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,023
you've used over the past four years,
melted them down

670
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,549
and fashioned weapons out of them.

671
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,766
But if that's true,
that would mean that...

672
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,186
That would mean that Prometheus
has access to SCPD lockup.

673
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,735
Oliver, I think we have a real lead
on who Prometheus is.

674
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,283
He's a member of the SCPD.

675
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,154
