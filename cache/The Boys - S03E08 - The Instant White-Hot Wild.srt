1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,377
Come on, earving.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,298
Me and the others have something
to sh-sh-sh-show you.

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,768
Oh, fuck.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,480
Butcher and soldier boy, where are they?

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,579
Why do I always have
to take the high road?

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,529
Mm! Soldier boy is gonna kill more people.

7
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,281
- It wasn't my idea.
- Oh, I know. It was noir's.

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,366
What the fuck is this?

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,493
Something we should've done
a long time ago.

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,454
Why the long face, tiger?

11
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,581
You're homelander. Button your shit up.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm proposing a strictly
transactional relationship.

13
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,421
Where's Ryan? I'm gonna find him
sooner or later.

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,465
I hate you.

15
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,050
Ready, mon coeur?

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,221
Temp v is gonna kill you both.

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,304
Jesus Christ.

18
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,723
I was just in the lab.

19
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,934
It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese!

20
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,769
You need to tell hughie.

21
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,312
Everything all right?

22
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:06,233
You, me and granny fucker
are gonna finish this fucking job.

23
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,628
- This really you?
- I thought we should have a conversation.

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,279
Vogelbaum made a kid.

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,907
Bitch of it is, I'd have let you
take the spotlight.

26
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,867
What father wouldn't want that
for his son?

27
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,007
Whoa!

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,049
I knew your fastball
would come in sooner or later.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,054
- Stay away from him!
- It's okay.

30
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,515
I'm not here to cause trouble,
hurt anyone.

31
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,017
Just want to see my son.

32
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,854
And I had a heck of a time
trying to find you, buddy, I...

33
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,860
Even had to get a big,
important congresswoman to help me.

34
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,487
She been treating you all right?

35
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,615
Aunt grace?

36
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,117
Yeah, she's nice.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,243
"Aunt grace."

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,746
Okay.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,501
You know, she may be nice, Ryan,
but she's not your aunt.

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,004
She's not even your real family.

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:14,009
I can hear those clumsy fingers of yours
slipping around on that screen.

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,427
Get rid of it now.

43
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,061
Listen, Ryan.

44
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,106
Your mom, she wanted what's best for you.

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,691
And so do I.

46
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,943
You have a real family.

47
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,155
But aren't you mad at me?

48
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,700
For what I did?

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,745
You know it wasn't your fault, right?

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,297
Son, when you're as strong as we are,

51
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,300
accidents happen, uh, things break,

52
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,388
and sometimes they are the things
that you love the most.

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,016
But-but that's all it is: An accident.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,311
And nobody on this earth
knows that better than me.

55
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,939
Nobody.

56
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,401
That why I'm always gonna love you.

57
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,698
No matter what happens,
no matter... what you do.

58
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,327
I'm not going anywhere.
I will always be here.

59
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,926
Homelander admitted on video
he locked up Maeve!

60
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,928
Bullshit!

61
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,682
Well, great news!

62
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,351
We just heard
the Attorney General's office

63
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,894
has a search warrant,

64
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,814
and they're coming here to free Maeve!

65
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,191
Free Maeve! Free Maeve!

66
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,485
Starlight lies! Children die!

67
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,696
Starlight lies! Children die!

68
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,343
I really think we should've waited
for homelander.

69
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,035
Well, I don't know where he is. Do you?

70
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,329
But I do know the Attorney General
is an attention whore

71
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,789
who loves to be on Don lemon.

72
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,585
And she's on her way here right now
with a search warrant to look for her.

73
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,367
Where's soldier boy?

74
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,456
You mean, ever since he told us
he was supposed to kill his own son?

75
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,876
He locked himself in the bathroom
with a bottle of old grandad.

76
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,754
Well, homelander ain't really his son,
and he knows it.

77
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,467
All right, let's be off then, eh?

78
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,512
We'll swing by the office
and grab some more v.

79
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,264
And then hughie will jump us
to where the cunts are.

80
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,684
We do noir and homelander.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,064
And we're finished. Right?

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
Bonjour.

83
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,025
I got you something.

84
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,908
- Voila.
- Fuck is that?

85
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,870
Oh, this is it.

86
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,415
Cost three bugattis-worth
of starlight's money, but...

87
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,918
A dose of novichok.

88
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,712
Our weapon against soldier boy.

89
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,298
And the only fucking dose
on the eastern seaboard.

90
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,384
You put the world's deadliest nerve agent

91
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,846
in a ten-dollar bottle
of starlight's wish?

92
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,681
I must say, the smell has improved.

93
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,310
Great.

94
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,985
So you lost your temper and hit a man.

95
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,862
Oh, this is nothing.

96
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,906
You know, I once took a spaniard's ear

97
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,325
forjabbering at a screening
of 27 dresses...

98
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,161
Frenchie, my whole point has always been

99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,413
to keep my fucked-up shit

100
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,540
away from Janine.

101
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,710
I lost control for one second,

102
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,629
and for the rest of her life,

103
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,632
she's gonna have an image of her daddy

104
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,842
beating up her stepfather.

105
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,886
I got to lock my shit down.

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,846
I got to be stronger.

107
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,975
Out of all man's miseries,
the most bitter is this.

108
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,019
To know so much...

109
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,939
And to control so little.
I've read a fucking book, all right?

110
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,062
You cannot keep the truth
from your daughter that...

111
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,319
That you are... a deeply...

112
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,031
Broken and fucked-up man.

113
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,077
So am I.

114
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,120
So are we all, no?

115
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,415
But you're also, perhaps,
the best man I ever known.

116
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,628
Let Janine see all of it.

117
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,302
And get back on the fucking Lexapro.

118
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,474
Homelander's shocking admissions
on starlight's Instagram live feed

119
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,476
led to the largest single-day drop

120
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,287
in the history
of vought international stock...

121
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,230
Hey! There you are.

122
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,357
Where were you?

123
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,150
What do you want?

124
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,443
- Come with me.
- I'm walking.

125
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,779
Um... so...

126
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,657
While you were gone,

127
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,494
deep and I had to move Maeve
out of the tower.

128
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,620
That was your idea.

129
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,288
You were there.

130
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,608
- We didn't have a choice.
- Okay.

131
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,367
- There was a search warrant.
- I wanted to wait for you, homelander.

132
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,285
- But she insisted.
- Can you just shut the fuck up?

133
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,644
Where is Maeve now?

134
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,524
Noir, hey.

135
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,608
Bro.

136
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,490
We're just gonna... we're gonna go.

137
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,034
Yeah. This... okay.

138
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,326
Talk to you guys later.

139
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,269
Let's fuck up soldier boy.

140
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,780
I knew you'd come back.

141
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,839
Hey, uh...

142
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,137
You really are the spitting image
of my little brother.

143
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,472
What?

144
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,697
- Oh, there he is.
- Where's the cum guzzler?

145
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,990
You were spot-on about him.

146
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,076
There I was, filling up the motor,

147
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,161
I turn around, the little git
had done a runner.

148
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,830
We needed him to get near noir.

149
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,998
Ah, don't you worry about that, guv.

150
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,542
I got it all worked out.

151
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,883
Wake me when we get to New York.

152
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,109
Need a hand?

153
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,448
More in the market for some legs.

154
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,290
- What happened to you?
- You'll never believe it.

155
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,958
They gave me a new ticker.

156
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,459
I'm gonna be able to run again.

157
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,799
All the races and the endorsements.

158
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,261
I'm about to get it all back.

159
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,102
But it don't mean shit without you.

160
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,980
I need you.

161
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,234
Come coach me and you can still work
with the kids at the broke-ass school.

162
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,445
Hell, you'll make enough
to fix the damn place up.

163
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,409
I'm really fucking sorry, Nate.

164
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,579
I'll spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

165
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
- Did you kill blue hawk?
- What?

166
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,216
No, that was... soldier boy.

167
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,052
Hmm.

168
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,887
You did.

169
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,889
- No, Nate...
- I didn't want that!

170
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,892
I wanted my kids
to see his mug shot on the TV.

171
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,101
And now he's...

172
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,229
- Fuck!
- I stopped him.

173
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,232
Foryou.

174
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,025
Don't say you did that for me.

175
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,903
You've only ever been about yourself.

176
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,239
- I'm sorry. I'll make it right.
- How?

177
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,324
Every time you try, you make it worse.

178
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,912
Reggie, just-just go, man.

179
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,705
Just go, just get out, okay?

180
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,791
Go sell your menthol vapes

181
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,377
and your fast cash shops and all of that.

182
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,212
But just stay out of my life!

183
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,296
Nate.

184
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,965
Come on, man.

185
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,884
I said, get the fuck out of my house!

186
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,679
I don't want a murderer
in the same house with my kids!

187
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,389
- Shit!
- Nate, I'm sorry.

188
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,641
- Shit, Nate...
- Don't touch me!

189
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,978
Don't come back here.

190
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,924
Thanks for picking me up.

191
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,553
Sure you want to tell me
to go fuck myself.

192
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,096
I'm not saying anything.

193
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,474
'Cause if you did want to say that,
I mean, you could.

194
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,438
What happened?

195
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,106
Uh... butcher.

196
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,317
Just out of nowhere, knocked me out.

197
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,609
Did he tell you?

198
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,404
Tell me what?

199
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,865
That temp v is fatal.

200
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,161
If you shot up any more,
you'd probably be dead right now.

201
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,621
Oh, my fucking god, he didn't tell you!

202
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,540
- That asshole!
- Saved my life.

203
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
Saved your life?

204
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,461
It looks like he gave you a concussion.

205
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,130
He stopped me from taking more v.

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,844
H-Have you ever had pizza rolls?

207
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,225
Like middle school sleepover pizza rolls?

208
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,937
Yeah, dad bought them in bulk
after mom left.

209
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,899
Every night, we'd have pizza rolls,

210
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,776
watch Remington Steele,

211
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,111
try not to touch her spot on the couch.

212
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,406
And he never fought back
for her or anything.

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,076
Just sat there eating pizza rolls.

214
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,787
I spent so much time thinking he was...

215
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,331
Sad and-and weak.

216
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,166
Just a loser.

217
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,878
But you know what? Dad... was there.

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,216
Taking care of me
during-during the worst days of his life,

219
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,177
just trying to keep the lights on
and a...

220
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,887
And a roof above our heads.

221
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,058
He wasn't weak.

222
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,939
I just, I-I didn't know what strength was.

223
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,944
Annie, I'm-I'm so sorry.

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,405
I've been an asshole.

225
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,697
I never should have...

226
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,700
I-I never should've put
any of this onto you.

227
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,622
Thank you for saying that.

228
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,754
Literally every neuron in your brain
is screaming "I told you so,"

229
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,857
so why don't you just say it
before your head explodes.

230
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,634
Oh, my god! I fucking told you so.

231
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,302
Feel good to get that out?

232
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,186
So satisfying. Oh, my god.

233
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,976
Hello?

234
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,438
Oh, my god, where are you?

235
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,284
Hey.

236
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,537
Hey, Maeve.
Good to see you again.

237
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,705
Glad you're okay.

238
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,500
It's like you wear a neon sign
that says, "raw dog me, I'm a bottom."

239
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,752
- I'm gonna let you two catch up.
- Me, too.

240
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,924
Where were you?

241
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,220
About 12 floors below you in the tower
this whole time.

242
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,972
How did you get out?

243
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,849
Your #freemaeve shit

244
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,728
had every lgb-teen in the world
up vought's ass.

245
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,689
You got me my chance.

246
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,662
You know what would've
been better, though?

247
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,569
Actually busting me out.

248
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,362
I think that would've been way harder.

249
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,746
Merde! That hurt!

250
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,127
I have done my part.

251
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,255
Yeah, I am.

252
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,842
Nina was right.

253
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,053
My papa, he put a chain around my neck.

254
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,306
And all that fucking changes
is who holds the other end.

255
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,920
What do you see?

256
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,097
Soldier boy is homelander's fucking what?

257
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,265
Homelander's father.

258
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,392
Biologically, at least.

259
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,435
So put them in a room together,

260
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,105
- are they gonna fight or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

261
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,024
Soldier boy's been, uh, weird.
But butcher...

262
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,828
If there's a snowball's chance
that butcher can take down homelander,

263
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,070
he's gonna take it.

264
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,573
I don't care what your orders are,
I'm starlight,

265
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,201
and I'm telling you that you need
to evacuate the tower now.

266
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,162
Because soldier boy
is alive and he's real,

267
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,598
and he's gonna f...

268
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,249
Oh, fucking, you fucking stupid..

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,001
Fuck.

270
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,170
There are a couple thousand people
in that building.

271
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,299
I mean, if he pulls a herogasm,

272
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,142
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

273
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,470
Then we take down soldier boy
before he gets to homelander.

274
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,889
And save butcher.

275
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,893
Y'all two fuck us over,

276
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,104
and now you want to be
motherfucking Teresa?

277
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,357
- I know. And-and I'm sorry...
- Hughie.

278
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,984
Some people are just past saving.

279
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,193
He don't want to be saved.

280
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,130
He could've dragged me
down with him, but he didn't.

281
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,447
There's still something good.

282
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
Deep, deep...

283
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,119
Deep inside.

284
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,495
Balls deep.

285
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,789
Perhaps.

286
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,499
Bonjour, petit hughie.

287
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,917
We save everyone.

288
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,295
Even if they don't deserve it.

289
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,048
Especially if they don't deserve it.

290
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,683
Whoa, that brings me back.

291
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,813
Used to sneak my dad's Manhattans
when I was a kid.

292
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,899
I didn't have to Nick nothin'
from my old man.

293
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,860
He used to get me and me little brother
iagered just for the hell of it.

294
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,364
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

295
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,618
- The old man still around?
- Arse cancer.

296
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,081
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

297
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,878
You ever see the soldier boy story?

298
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,047
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

299
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,966
We lost best picture
to an American in Paris that year.

300
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,637
At least I got to ass-fuck Jane Wyman
in the coat check.

301
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,724
About a poor kid
from the streets of south Philly.

302
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,064
Discovers he's got incredible powers
to match his heart of gold.

303
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,442
It's all bullshit.

304
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,611
Blimey, you don't say?

305
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,447
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

306
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,616
I went to boarding school.

307
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,119
Got kicked out of boarding school.

308
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,705
Because I was a fuck-up.

309
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,458
But he made sure I knew it.

310
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,626
Use the belt, did he?

311
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,378
Never laid a hand on me.

312
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,713
He couldn't be bothered.

313
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
Said I was a disappointment.

314
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,554
Not good enough to carry his name.

315
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,518
So I went to his golf buddies
in the war department,

316
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,105
and they get me into Dr. Vought's
compound v trials.

317
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,857
I became a superhero.

318
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,108
Strongest man alive.

319
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,694
Fucking ticker tape parades
when I came home.

320
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
And what did the old man say then?

321
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,495
He said I took a shortcut.

322
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,711
That a real man wouldn't have cheated.

323
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,845
Mmm.

324
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,972
What about you, you got kids?

325
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,974
It's complicated.

326
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,268
I always assumed I had a few out there.

327
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,896
Somewhere.

328
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,025
I always wanted 'em.

329
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,696
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

330
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,742
Homelander ain't yours. Not really.

331
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,694
- He's the only blood I've got left.
- It don't matter.

332
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,080
You didn't name him, didn't raise him.

333
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,293
Vought grew him in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

334
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,838
He's the fucking reason
they left you to rot with the ivans.

335
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,590
Look, mate.

336
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,553
We had a deal.

337
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,819
I'm gonna get some air.

338
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,502
Sharpen it for a thousand hours,

339
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,671
still won't cut soldier boy's skin.

340
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:29,348
So... you were on his team. You knew him.

341
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,476
What was he like?

342
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,984
Come on.

343
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,694
Nobody's all bad.

344
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,160
He's my father.

345
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,330
I didn't believe him at first.

346
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:57,626
I ripped apart the company archives,
and... it's true.

347
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,046
It's true.

348
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,384
They lied to me my whole life.

349
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,554
Surprise.

350
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,726
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

351
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,772
Now, well, I...

352
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,611
I'm not sure I want to.

353
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,866
It's funny, you know,
everyone thinks of you as this, uh...

354
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,701
Unreadable sphinx.

355
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,495
A mystery.

356
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,999
Not me. I see through that mask.

357
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,170
I mean, literally, I can see your face.

358
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,963
Your battle scars.

359
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,342
The crooked old smile of yours.

360
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,718
I know when you're happy,

361
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,930
sad, telling the truth.

362
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,349
Lying.

363
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,144
Did you know?

364
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,814
That I had a father out there?

365
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,193
Alive this whole time?

366
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,212
Fuck.

367
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,841
Why didn't you tell me?

368
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,964
You should've told me.

369
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,553
[Gulps gasps}

370
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,604
D-D-Don't worry, earving.

371
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,940
We are so proud of you.

372
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,778
Soon you'll be in the sweet embrace

373
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,531
of c-c-c...

374
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
Christ the lord!

375
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,226
Fuck me. I figured you was dead.

376
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,355
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots were, motherfucker?

377
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,523
Back up.

378
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,986
Where's soldier boy?

379
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,238
You on that temp v shit, butcher, huh?

380
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,991
What happens if I pull this trigger?

381
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,701
Go on, do it.

382
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,036
Hey, mm, mm, stop.

383
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
Mm!

384
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,874
If soldier boy goes through with this,
thousands will die.

385
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,501
Help us stop him.

386
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,878
This ain't a bloody kinder care
we're on about, son.

387
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,172
Its vought fucking tower.

388
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,590
Becca worked in the tower.

389
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,301
You shut your fucking cake hole, frenchie.

390
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,639
No. No!

391
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,936
No, my cake hole will remain open!

392
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,189
You will never command me again.

393
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,459
- I am done with your cruelty.
- Okay, frenchie...

394
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,818
I deserve respect!

395
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,154
And we all deserve paid vacation days,
and a dental plan!

396
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,531
We-we-we heard you.

397
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,410
You could've let me die from the v,
but you saved me.

398
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,622
In the shittiest way possible, but still.

399
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,376
I don't think you want to do this.

400
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,087
I think you want me to pull you back.

401
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,381
Like Lenny used to.

402
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,471
- Maeve, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

403
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,601
Butcher's right. Homelander needs to die.

404
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,979
That's it. Whatever it takes.

405
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,607
I really thought
that deep down you were a hero.

406
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,319
Well, you were wrong.
There's no such thing.

407
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,114
This is not gonna happen.

408
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,367
Annie, I don't want to hurt you.

409
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,327
But I will.

410
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,374
All right, you lot.

411
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,667
In the safe.

412
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

413
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
In the safe.

414
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,222
Let's go.

415
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,602
Hey, not now. Not like this.

416
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,534
Hang about.

417
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,746
Tinker bell needs power for her powers.

418
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,501
I'm starlight and I'm telling you
that you need to evacuate the tower now.

419
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,586
Why?

420
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,504
Because soldier boy is alive and he...

421
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,506
We ran it through
the voice thing-a-ma-Bob.

422
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,801
It's really her, so, you know,
I think we should probably evacuate.

423
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,487
Nobody's evacuating anything.

424
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,263
We have to project strength.

425
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,683
Right. No, that's smart. Strength.

426
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,353
Okay, so my angel fish...
That's what I call analytics...

427
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,315
We think soldier boy's coming for noir,
last member of payback, right?

428
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,983
So we should use noir as bait.

429
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,107
And that way it draws
soldier boy directly to the...

430
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,912
Hey, is everything...
Is everything okay with noir?

431
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,164
He was keeping secrets from me.

432
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,377
You know, when the company first
rolled me out in front of the cameras,

433
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,172
they told me...
I was gonna get my very own team.

434
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,718
I wanted so badly for that team
to be the family that I never got.

435
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,680
And then I got you.

436
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,475
I've-I've always tried to help, sir.

437
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,852
What, like when you ran away
from herogasm?

438
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,771
Or maybe when you fucked an octopus?

439
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,191
You really want to help?

440
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,585
Sir...

441
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,713
That's sort of treason.

442
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,964
Big word.

443
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,302
Anything you need, homelander.

444
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,304
Sir.

445
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,599
Ashley, take off that wig.

446
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,727
What wig?

447
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,204
Hmm.

448
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,956
And then there's you.

449
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,794
How could you kill one of your own kind
in cold blood?

450
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,547
You are going to tell the world

451
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,635
that we are the one and only true justice.

452
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,059
Noir was worth more
than all of you put together.

453
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,314
You're not my family.

454
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,441
I don't need any of you.

455
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,734
Remember that.

456
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,618
On the record?

457
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,704
If Dakota Bob taps me for vp,
I'd be honored.

458
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,039
Off the record?

459
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,209
I'm expecting good news
at the prayer breakfast.

460
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,746
Fuck.

461
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,712
Ooh.

462
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,258
They got a really big head start,
but... I know a way in.

463
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,717
Then what?

464
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,720
'Cause from where I'm standing,
we're fucked with no grease.

465
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,722
No plan and no knockout gas.

466
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,474
- Where do we get some more?
- We don't.

467
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,143
That was the only one.

468
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,649
There is one lab in New York...

469
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,527
That might be stocked
with the things I need.

470
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,280
And as fate would have it,
we are headed there, so...

471
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,523
- You're joking.
- We're gonna break into vought tower,

472
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,076
while you go to the lab
crawling with armed guards

473
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,430
and you're gonna cook up
the world's most dangerous neurotoxin

474
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,332
with, what, a little moxie
and a little Mr. Wizard know-how

475
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,128
while we hold off
homelander and soldier boy?

476
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,839
Oui.

477
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,761
It's good enough for me.

478
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,846
Hmm.

479
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,556
Me, too.

480
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,937
Monsieur lait de mere?

481
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,482
The most important shit of my life,

482
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,985
and I'm counting on coked-out eurotrash.

483
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,782
Shit's baffling.

484
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,972
The prisoners you liberated here,

485
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,474
most of them were nearly dead.

486
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,808
They owe you their lives.

487
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,101
I'm not here to take credit.

488
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,325
These boys here, they're the real heroes.

489
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,648
What the jerries did here is unforgivable.

490
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,983
But [promise you, I'm gonna serve them up

491
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,194
some good old-fashioned American justice.

492
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,072
Scorched earth, eh, William?

493
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,657
Scorched earth.

494
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,121
Where's noir?

495
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,585
He's dead.

496
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,547
I killed him.

497
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,132
Why?

498
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,176
Because he didn't tell me about you.

499
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,721
I'm alone.

500
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,433
I just want to talk.

501
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,272
I know what it's like to have your team
betray you.

502
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,692
But with you and I together...

503
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,820
They wouldn't stand a chance.
Nobody would.

504
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,994
Unless we kill each other first.

505
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,414
That's true. But why?

506
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,040
What, because he says so?

507
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,542
He's nothing.

508
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,918
He's human.

509
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,004
Don't you listen to this fucking twat.

510
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,214
He ain't your kid.

511
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,341
Yes, I am. I am your son.

512
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,759
I am your blood.

513
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,429
That's all that matters.

514
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,015
Maybe.

515
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,235
Ryan.

516
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,323
This is my son. Ryan.

517
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,407
Your grandson.

518
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,619
Hi, grandpa.

519
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,330
You see?

520
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,249
You have a family. You have him.

521
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,545
And you have me.

522
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,845
It's a shame that I've missed...

523
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,431
So much.

524
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,727
I wish I could've raised you
and taught you,

525
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,145
father to son.

526
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,814
Me too. That's okay.

527
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,316
We're not alone anymore.

528
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,692
We have each other.

529
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,865
Maybe if I'd raised you...

530
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,118
I could've made you better.

531
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,750
And not some weak, sniveling pussy,

532
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,211
starved for attention.

533
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,423
But there's no fixing that now.

534
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,591
Vveak?

535
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,178
- I'm you.
- I know.

536
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,058
You're a fucking disappointment.

537
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,685
Leave him alone!

538
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,270
- Get out of here, Ryan!
- Please, stop!

539
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,873
- Get out of the building! Now!
- Butcher, stop!

540
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,232
- Please!
- You can't.

541
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,109
- You can't do this.
- Stop! Please!

542
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,237
Don't do this. Don't do this. Don't.

543
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,745
Ryan, get back upstairs. Right now.

544
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,958
Ryan!

545
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,131
You little shit.

546
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,144
Ryan. Hey.

547
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,338
What the fuck are you doing?

548
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,841
- Not the kid.
- I thought you said blood didn't matter.

549
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,485
Thought that was the whole fucking point.

550
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,510
He's my wife's son.

551
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,765
Wait, homelander fucked your wife?

552
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,350
And you want to save the brat?

553
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,519
The hell's wrong with you?

554
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,146
I made a promise.

555
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,564
So this is it.

556
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,067
Everything you wanted,
he's right fucking there,

557
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,235
and now you blink?

558
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,361
Stand down.

559
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,654
Fuck you.

560
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,575
You're weaker than he is.

561
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,622
Hey.

562
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,958
- Dad.
- Yeah. I'm right here.

563
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,627
You're okay.

564
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,135
Hey, asshole.

565
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,765
Not now, Maeve. We have bigger fish.

566
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,141
Idont

567
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,687
I said, not now.

568
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,571
Maeve, stop.

569
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,240
Maeve...

570
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,709
C'est le paradis.

571
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,609
Testing, testing, testing.

572
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,761
Okay, that's loud. Uh...

573
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,606
Attention. There has been a terrorist
threat called into the building.

574
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,799
Please leave as quickly as you can.

575
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,060
This is not a drill,
this is not this is not a test.

576
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,080
- Please evacuate quickly.
- Where are you going, Ashley?

577
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,731
With you, Ashley. To the helipad?

578
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:04,277
Yeah. So, the sikorsky's actually reserved
for svps and higher.

579
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
Do not trample anyone
on the way out.

580
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,907
Sorry, Ashley.

581
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,075
Leave as quickly
as you can. Thank you.

582
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,843
Freeze! Show us your hands!

583
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,638
J" it can cut you like a knife j“

584
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,766
j" if the gift becomes the fire j”

585
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,310

586
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,937
j” and what will be j“

587
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,147
j" she's a maniac j“

588
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,025
j“ maniac on the floor j“

589
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,012
Aah! Aah!

590
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,015
Aw, fuck!

591
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,832
J“ she's a maniac j“

592
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,835
j“ maniac, I sure know j“

593
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:49,799
j“ and she's dancing
like she's never danced before j“

594
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,969
j“ she's a maniac j“

595
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,638
j“ maniac I sure know j“

596
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,270
j“ and she's dancing
like she's never danced before j“

597
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,400
j“ maniac, maniac, I sure know j“

598
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,783
I've got the novichok. Huh?

599
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,956
Now... go.

600
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,961
Aah!

601
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,049
Yeah! Fuck your shield, bitch.

602
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,258
Oh, no.

603
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,219
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,339
You ain't no hero.

605
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,968
You're just another racist piece of shit
we can't seem to get rid of.

606
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,761
This is for my family.

607
00:44:56,027 --> 00:45:00,740
I'm not going back in that fucking box!

608
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,158
You'll kill everyone.

609
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,278
Shit.

610
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,876
Are you hurt?

611
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,337
Ryan, look at me.

612
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,609
Dad...

613
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,322
I want to go.

614
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,494
Let's leave. Please.

615
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,913
I want to leave.

616
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,790
Ryan.

617
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,134
Please.

618
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,468
She was one of america's
greatest superheroes.

619
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,804
A role model for little girls everywhere.

620
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,391
A strong, proud lesbian
who pioneered the way for others

621
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,684
to show the world who they really are.

622
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,561
And she made the ultimate sacrifice

623
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,981
when she stopped Russian-radicalized
soldier boy and saved us all.

624
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,907
We drained the fluid, but, uh...

625
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,117
Mr. Butcher?

626
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,702
Sorry.

627
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,414
Attempting further treatment
would significantly impact

628
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,541
your quality of life without...

629
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,626
Necessarily extending the time you have.

630
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,257
Uh, sir, no smoking.

631
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,636
- How long I got?
- Months.

632
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,140
Twelve. Eighteen, on the outside.

633
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,982
Hmm.

634
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,278
Well, you can kindly fuck off, then.

635
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,916
You know,
for the longest time, Janine, I...

636
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,752
I didn't want to bring you into this.

637
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,881
But you know what?

638
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,676
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

639
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:35,598
Truth is, superheroes aren't always good.

640
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,851
One of them, soldier boy...

641
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,397
Killed a lot of our family members
a long time ago.

642
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,902
It makes me sad.

643
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,823
Sometimes it makes me mad
when I think about it.

644
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,414
But...

645
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,750
Your granddaddy,

646
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,546
he spent his entire life
fighting to get justice.

647
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,550
And now I do, too.

648
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,929
I just want you to know
that you should be proud.

649
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,100
Your granddaddy...
Now, he was a real hero.

650
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,022
You're my hero, daddy.

651
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,777
Thank you.

652
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,493
Hello?

653
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,954
It's me.

654
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,623
Are you there?

655
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:47,962
Oh, god.

656
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,214
Well, you, uh...

657
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,300
You look like shit.

658
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,010
Fuck off, smurfette.

659
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,557
You gonna be okay?

660
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,059
Yeah, slowly, painfully,

661
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,646
like every other powerless schmuck
in america,

662
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,023
thanks to soldier boy.

663
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,904
Question: Should I get a pirate patch

664
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,156
or the Sammy Davis glass eye?

665
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,033
Oh, the pirate patch, no question.

666
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,243
You ready?

667
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,161
- Hey.
- Hey, Elena.

668
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,915
Where will you guys go?

669
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,710
I don't know, somewhere
homelander won't find me.

670
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,837
A farm, ideally.

671
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,672
She's from modesto.

672
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,924
She was a future farmer of america.

673
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,051
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,180
Thank you.

675
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,517
For everything.

676
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:49,356
First time your prissy ass
showed up at the tower...

677
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,567
Crying in that bathroom...

678
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,528
You saved me.

679
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,406
Truth is, you... you don't need me anymore.

680
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,783
I could jump.

681
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,786
But you can fucking fly.

682
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,425
You're like a walking
hallmark card. Enough.

683
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,888
Bye.

684
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,562
J“ when are you gonna come down? J“

685
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,857
j“ when are you going to land? J“

686
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,944
j“ I should have stayed on the farm j“

687
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:39,615
j“ I should have listened to my old man j“

688
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,994
j“ you know you can't hold me foreverj“

689
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,956
j“ I didn't sign up for you j“

690
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:52,628
j“ I'm not a present
for your friends to open j“

691
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,340
j“ this boy's too young to be singing j“

692
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,761
j“ the blues j“

693
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,556
j“ ah, ah-ah, ah-ah j“

694
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,185
j“ ah-ah-ah, ah j“

695
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:12,064
j“ so goodbye yellow brick road j“

696
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:15,401
j“ where the dogs of society howl j“

697
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,239
j“ you can't plant me in your penthouse j“

698
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,659
j“ I'm going back to my plow j“

699
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,247
j“ back to the howling
old owl in the woods j“

700
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,834
j“ hunting the horny-back toad j“

701
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,337
j“ oh, I've finally decided j“

702
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,923
j“ my future lies j“

703
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,551
j“ beyond the yellow brick road... j“

704
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,221
- you don't know the real Kevin.
- Mmm.

705
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,348
And you wouldn't like him if you did.

706
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:53,772
J“ ah-ah-ah, ah j“

707
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,450
You sure you want to do this?

708
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,003
I don't need it.

709
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,589
I don't. The suit never gave me any power.

710
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,216
And vought sure as shit didn't.

711
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,683
It's always just been me.

712
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,566
- Uh, Annie?
- Mm-hmm?

713
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,444
You know, we're in a historic building.

714
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,029
- You need to double-knot...
- Okay.

715
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,655
And bag your trash,

716
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,241
if you're gonna be working here.

717
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,578
Butcher isn't gonna like it.

718
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,955
Butcher can suck my shit.

719
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,042
Oh, from now on, this is a democracy, huh?

720
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,086
I say you're one of the boys.

721
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,131
Me too.

722
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,243
Oh, fuck.

723
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,665
After the tragic drowning
of presumptive vp candidate Lamar bishop,

724
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,751
we go live to the singer campaign
in sioux falls,

725
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,337
where Dakota Bob just announced
his new running mate.

726
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,840
What would you like to say
to the American people?

727
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,969
As the next vice president,
I will work hard

728
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,430
to provide a safe and secure future
for all citizens,

729
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,474
on both sides of the political divide.

730
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,561
And that's why I am so proud
to have her on my team.

731
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:03,443
Singer! Singer! Singer! Singer!

732
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,406
Singer! Singer! Singer! Singer! Singer!

733
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,490
Well...

734
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,080
That bitch

735
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,958
has definitely got to go.

736
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,380
Let's go!

737
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,759
- Come on!
- Fuck you. Yeah!

738
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,595
- Hey, there he is, there he is.
- Hey, hey!

739
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,179
Fuck you and your lies!

740
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,642
Fuck starlight! Fuck starlight!

741
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,770
- Fuck starlight!
- Homelander!

742
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,611
Hi. Good to see you.

743
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,905
I love you guys.

744
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,656
You are america.

745
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,283
True patriots.

746
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,744
Hey, do you want to meet someone?

747
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,245
Someone very special to me?

748
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,330
- Yes.
- Yeah?

749
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,414
- Yes!
- All right.

750
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,707
Come on down here, buddy.

751
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,335
The kid!

752
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,713
All-righty, everyone.

753
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,549
This little guy here

754
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,218
is my son, Ryan.

755
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,662
- You have a son?
- That's so awesome.

756
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,350
- Yeah, he's a chip off the block.
- Fuck you, fascist!

757
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,571
- What the fuck? He's a kid!
- Who did that?

758
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,243
- What the fuck, iibtard?
- Fucking idiot!

759
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,290
Yeah...

760
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,125
Yeah!

761
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,836
Yeah!

762
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,547
Fuck yeah!

763
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,719
Fuck that piece of shit.

764
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,055
- That's how Americans do it!
- All right.
