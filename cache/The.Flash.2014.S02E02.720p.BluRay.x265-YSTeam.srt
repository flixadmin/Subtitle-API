1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:06,131
BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,176
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,228
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,809
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,736
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother, but in doing so,

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,359
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,443
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,574
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,952
BARRY: Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,871
- No!
- The man who saved Central City.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,582
Why did you wanna kill me?

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,162
He promised he'd take me home...

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,713
- Who?
- Zoom.

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,006
Wells killed my mother.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,131
I don't know anything anymore,
especially who I can and can't trust.

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,177
S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

17
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,097
People can'tjust waltz
in and out of here.

18
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,344
Exactly.

19
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,890
Stay where you are.

20
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,517
My name is Jay Garrick.
And your world is in danger,

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,767
Barry Allen.

22
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,101
Please, just let me explain.
I mean you no harm.

23
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:00,401
How do you know my name?

24
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,731
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow.
Cisco Ramon. Detective Joe West.

25
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,409
Enough! That part about "explaining"
needs to happen right about now.

26
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,328
This world is in danger.

27
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,201
What other worlds are there?

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,454
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

29
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,581
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,254
I'm sorry. A breach?

31
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,876
Yes. A portal, connecting our two Earths.

32
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,551
And what precisely is your concern?

33
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,254
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

34
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,635
But then, a different Al Rothstein
tried to kill you.

35
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,888
Atom Smasher.

36
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,264
That man was from my world.

37
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,311
If he got through the breach,
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

38
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:42,235
Okay. So, Jay,
how exactly do you know all this?

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,985
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

40
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,283
They called me the Flash.

41
00:01:55,531 --> 00:02:00,037
JAY: Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,246
Zoom?

43
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,090
I've heard that name before.

44
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,842
Atom Smasher, he said
Zoom sent him here to kill me.

45
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,718
Who is this guy?

46
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,180
He's a speedster, like you and me.
And fast.

47
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,182
Maybe the fastest of all, but evil.

48
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,765
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

49
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,780
We were engaged
in our fiercest battle ever,

50
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,199
racing throughout my city,
but I wasn't fast enough to stop him.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,777
(SCREAMS) Zoom had me beaten.

52
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,487
(SCREAMING)

53
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,406
He was about to kill me, when suddenly,

54
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,209
there was a blinding light,
and the sky split open.

55
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:44,338
A breach, between my world and yours
caused from the Singularity.

56
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,091
It pulled me in

57
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,265
and I somehow ended up in your world.

58
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,514
Powerless. Unable to return home.

59
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:58,971
What do you mean?

60
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,431
I lost my speed.

61
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,853
How?

62
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,933
I'm not entirely sure.

63
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,235
So, you've been in Central City
for six months.

64
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,907
Why haven't you come to see us before?

65
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,907
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.
I didn't know who you all were.

66
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,158
Took me that long
to piece it all together.

67
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,788
So that's how you know our names.
You've been following us.

68
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,252
Look, I know how this sounds.

69
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,420
The existence of another Earth,
you, another Flash?

70
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,051
It all came as an unexpected shock
to me, too.

71
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,548
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

72
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:39,182
There is.
We're gonna do some tests on you.

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,433
See if you're telling us the truth.

74
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,393
Because if you're not, this Zoom

75
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,986
is not gonna be your only enemy.

76
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,454
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

77
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,157
Where the hell am I?

78
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,667
(DISTORTED) You wanna go home?
You only have to do one thing.

79
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,000
- What's that?
- (DISTORTED) Kill the Flash.

80
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,307
So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been
the Flash on your world?

81
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,884
Not long enough to call me "Mister."

82
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,139
(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

83
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,389
Please, it's Jay.

84
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,682
Jay, of course.

85
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,310
On my world, I've been the Flash
for about two years.

86
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,733
And how did you get your speed?

87
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,062
I'm not really sure. I was at my lab
trying to purify heavy water

88
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,821
without any residual radiation
when there was a blinding light.

89
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,276
Uh, I fell into a coma.

90
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,737
When lwoke up, I could run
almost as fast as the speed of light.

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,954
Sorry, did you say "lab?"
Are you a scientist?

92
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,082
Well, certainly didn't work at a place
like this but yeah.

93
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,415
I had a respectable solo operation.

94
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,341
Part-time chemist. Part-time physicist.
Part-time superhero.

95
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,588
Hmm.

96
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,343
I can forget that
superhero part now though, huh. (CHUCKLES)

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,930
Is any of this possible? A breach
to another Earth? It's not, right?

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,853
The contrary. Just recently,
the many-different-worlds theory proposed

99
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,103
interaction with parallel universes
was plausible.

100
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,934
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

101
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,394
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

102
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,694
It doesn't add up.

103
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,488
I'm gonna be honest here.
I don't understand

104
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,406
what the hell any of you
are talking about.

105
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,829
So, Jay is saying he's from,
like, a mirror world.

106
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:25,375
Or a parallel universe,
that's very, very similar to ours.

107
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,499
Multi-verse would be
a more apt description.

108
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,338
Nope. Not helping.

109
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,257
- Bless your heart.
- Okay, see if this helps.

110
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,975
This is our Earth.
Let's call it, Earth One.

111
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,851
And this second Earth,
let's call it, Earth Two.

112
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,605
This is where Jay claims to be from.

113
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:56,360
And these other Earths,
three, four, five, to infinity.

114
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,079
All of them are nearly identical to ours,
and, uh, they all exist at the same time,

115
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,499
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

116
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,795
For example, uh, the Joe West
on Earth Two, your doppelganger,

117
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,750
he might not be a detective. He could be
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

118
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,257
And you, the Barry Allen here
is the Flash,

119
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,055
but over there,
he could be an electrician.

120
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,432
So I'm assuming that
the people on all these other Earths

121
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,012
work to make money to pay bills and such?

122
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,939
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

123
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,189
I'm heading back to the station. Call me
when this makes a little bit more sense.

124
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,691
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around the whole idea of time travel.

125
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,983
(CHUCKLES)

126
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,113
There is one problem that remains.

127
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,286
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

128
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,488
there is a breach
somewhere in Central City

129
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,120
that we need to find. And close for good.

130
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,125
Yeah, but how do we find it?
We don't even know what to look for.

131
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,004
Well, I suggest we put our heads
together and come up with a solution.

132
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,721
Not literally, of course.
Those days are over.

133
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,723
What'd you find?

134
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,225
Well, Jay's heart rate
is extraordinarily low.

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,182
And he does have
regenerative capabilities.

136
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,143
Other than that,
I'm not seeing any evidence

137
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,728
of the speed force in his system.

138
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,656
We don't even have proof that he's
a speedster, much less from another Earth?

139
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,324
- Not necessarily.
- What does that mean?

140
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,153
Well, Jay doesn't know this,
but while I was testing

141
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,490
his heart rate, blood pressure
and motor responses,

142
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,701
I also measured his autonomic reactions
while we were talking.

143
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,582
You gave him a lie-detector test?

144
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,000
And he passed it.

145
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,545
What if he's not a good guy,
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

146
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,427
Keep running tests.
See what else you can find out.

there may be positions available

on your anti-meta-human task force.

Yeah. Everybody quit.
There is no task force anymore.

who's interested in being on it.

Me.

00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,750
You do realize that meta-humans

157
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,252
- have super-powers, right?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,629
And even if they didn't,
you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

159
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,007
Because I'm a woman?

160
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,803
I didn't mean to imply that.

161
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,427
Good, because I know
how difficult this job would be,

162
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,350
but I think I'm an excellent candidate.

163
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,928
I triple-majored at Hudson
in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

164
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,937
I'm in prime physical condition. And,
I rated top of my class in marksmanship.

165
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,769
Your class? You don't even have
your stripes yet.

166
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,604
Soon. Been on thejob seven months, sir.

167
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,654
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

168
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,903
Detective Thawne, yes.
I know that he died,

169
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,451
and the one before him,
Fred Chyre, died, too.

170
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,950
But the one before, that's not dead,
just transferred.

171
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,998
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

172
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,741
Listen, Officer...

173
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,371
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

174
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,544
Yes, Spivot. The answer's no.

175
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,716
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.
Please, just an interview.

176
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,418
You just had the interview.
Didn't get the job.

177
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,808
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

178
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,144
I get it, kid. You're doing
what you think you have to.

179
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,312
But you'll all realize soon enough
that this, the tests,

180
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,154
it's unnecessary.
I want to help you, Barry. Not harm you.

181
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,282
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

182
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,908
If what you told me about Zoom is true,
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

183
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,158
instead of locking me up in here,
you better start listening.

184
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,745
Because if Zoom is involved,
you are going to need

185
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,498
a lot more than just me
at your side to stay alive.

186
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,663
CISCO: Barry, there's a fire at the
waterfront. Fire Department's en route.

187
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,331
I'm on my way.

188
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:43,957
Be careful.

189
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,184
(HONKING)

190
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,350
(SIRENS)

191
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,860
(CHATTERING)

192
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,364
That was the Flash!

193
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,615
(PANTING)

194
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:20,461
That was a big fire.
(PANTS) It's out, Cisco.

195
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,336
Copy that. See you in a bit.

196
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,171
(PANTS)

197
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,801
(GRUNTS)

198
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,135
(GRUNTING)

199
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,472
I thought it'd be harder than this.

200
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,230
(GRUNTS)

201
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:58,412
Barry? Hello? Are you there?

202
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,251
- What was that?
- THE FLASH: I don't know.

203
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,503
But we need to find out.

204
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,676
- Barr.
- Hey.

205
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,048
What are we dealing with here?

206
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,883
(SIGHS) Well, definitely a meta-human.
Got a pretty solid look at him

207
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,094
between punches
and he was, like, made of sand?

208
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,764
- Sand? Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

209
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:22,101
These walls are too porous
to pull any prints.

210
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:25,601
I can't even get one off the boat.
But check this out.

211
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,067
There's gasoline burns everywhere.

212
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,400
Water didn't go off.
Sprinklers weren't working.

213
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
This was arson.

214
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,243
Excuse me, Barry Allen?

215
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,038
- Yeah.
- Hi.

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,788
Two days in a row, Officer.
What a coincidence.

217
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,959
Or kismet,
if you believe in destiny or fate.

218
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,042
- I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
- Hey.

219
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,092
I'm really excited to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.

220
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,922
- Excuse me?
- Your forensic reports.

221
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,556
I read them sometimes. Who am I kidding?
All the time. I've actually read them all.

222
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,976
(CHUCKLES)

223
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,480
Wow, I don't think
that I've read them all.

224
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,640
They're always so detailed, you know.
They really paint a picture

225
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,152
like you were somehow actually there
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

226
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,654
Thank you.

227
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,322
Uh, anyhow, I found, uh, something.
Well, I think I found something.

228
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,578
It's just a theory,
but I would like to show you.

229
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,826
Great.

230
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,332
So, this right here
is the point of origin of the fire.

231
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,995
And look. I don't know
a sand blaster on the market

232
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:30,091
that can make a cut that precise. So,
I think a meta-human may have done this.

233
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,509
Here. I took a sample for you.

234
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,591
Uh, there's also some fingerprints
on the back of the pipe.

235
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,097
Should've gone into CSI work.

236
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,846
I love the science,
but out here's where all the action is.

237
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,811
- Isn't that right, Detective West?
- (CHUCKLES)

238
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,184
The answer's still "no," Officer...

239
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,438
- Spivot.
- Spivot.

240
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,687
Yeah.

241
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,019
What was that about?

242
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,153
I'm trying to join
the anti-meta-human task force.

243
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,355
Ah.

244
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,484
But you heard him.
Hey, he's kind of like your dad, right?

245
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,036
So, do you have any advice
on how I can crack his "no" code?

246
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,662
Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock

247
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,114
- since I was 11.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

248
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,370
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

249
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,707
- Deal.
- All right.

250
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,039
- It was nice to meet you, Barry.
- Yeah, you, too.

251
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,294
(CLEARS THROAT)

252
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,006
CAITLIN: His blood pressure is low,
his heart rate is low,

253
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,558
his oxygen levels are impressive.

254
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,724
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

255
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,014
No, but he's certainly
in the physical specimen range.

256
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,559
- In more ways than one?
- Hmm?

257
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,857
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.
That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you.

258
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,072
BARRY: Found it at the crime scene.

259
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:43,365
I mean, it's gotta be
from the meta-human that attacked me.

260
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,573
Huh.

261
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,618
- What is this stuff? Sand?
- (SIGHS)

262
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,711
It's not sand. It's human cells
whose myosin-two protein

263
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,913
have migrated to the cells' periphery.

264
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,923
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

265
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,756
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

266
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,921
giving them the appearance of sand.

267
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,597
Mmm, how do you know this?

268
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,592
They belong to a meta-human
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

269
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,229
I know you're new here,
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

270
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,148
The whole naming the bad guys thing,
that's myjam.

271
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,937
But you know what?
I'm gonna let you have that one,

272
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,894
'cause I actually kind of like it.
I'm not mad at that one.

273
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,149
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

274
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,943
Oh, uh, sorry. lt was all we could find.

275
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,322
I was gonna say 'cause it looks
a lot smaller on you, right?

276
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,615
(CHUCKLES)

277
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,081
I gotta do this thing.

278
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,626
So, who is this Sand Demon?

279
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,460
I don't know his name,
but I know how to stop him.

280
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,466
You know what,
I think we'll be fine on our own.

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,674
Look, Barry, I don't know what else
I can do to prove to you I'm on your side.

282
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,142
I've been poked, prodded, I even
subjected myself to a full body scan.

283
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,471
I was being thorough.

284
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,975
Sand Demon's from my world.
Let me teach you how to stop him.

285
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

286
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,815
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

287
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,817
He must've sent Sand Demon here
to do the same thing.

288
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,822
Don't you get it?
Anyone close to the Flash,

289
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,653
all of you, are in a lot of danger!

290
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:05,955
All right. If you were so good,
you would've caught him already.

291
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,038
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

292
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,713
Whoa.

293
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,509
Hey, Beautiful Mind.
I think you need to take a breather.

294
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:23,804
(SIGHS)

295
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:27,384
After some lengthy calculations,
I believe I have discovered

296
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,855
the key to proving
the proposed breach theory.

297
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,514
Exotic matter.

298
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,816
Huh.

299
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,528
You mean like trans-dimensional energy.

300
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,571
Precisely. Exotic matter,

301
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,692
trans-dimensional energy
will theoretically leak

302
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,032
from one universe into another.

303
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,868
Now, if this breach
Mr. Garrick is talking about is real,

304
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,537
if there is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth...

305
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,707
We can make some adjustments and
upload an electrophotography program

306
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,921
to the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite

307
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,421
and essentially photograph
the exotic matter leak.

Thereby giving us
the locale of said breach.

309
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,429
Last time I saw the kit,
it was in the fabrication room.

310
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,722
I shall return.

311
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,102
- Oh-hoo-hoo!

312
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,688
Getting goosies. All right.

313
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,570
Let's see what you're made of.
It's too much.

00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:01,774
Hey.

319
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,278
I found our meta. His name is Eddie Slick.
We tracked those prints to his address.

320
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,657
All right. Where are you?
I'll meet you there.

321
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,413
- Too late, he made me.
- What? Joe!

322
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,258

(MAN GROANING)

324
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,641
So, can I be on your task force?

325
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,778
That look familiar?

326
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,989
- How about now? What's it look like?
- A fire.

327
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:55,657
There you go, genius. It's the fire
you started in the third ward last night.

328
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,834
Man, I didn't start
no fire there last night.

329
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,458
What, were you out of town?

- (SCOFFS)
- Well, let me guess.

331
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,712
You don't start fires anymore.
You've been rehabilitated.

332
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,381
Yeah, I've done it before. So what?

333
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,798
I didn't do this one.

334
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,054
I always start a fire
with somethin' that's hard to trace.

335
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,301
You know, like acetone or somethin'.

336
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,184
Or maybe you don't need to use
accelerants anymore.

337
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,811
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.
You know that, right?

338

What, you think I'm one of those
meta-human freaks?

339

I would've used 'em to get away from you?

- Why?

Jimmy, I need you
to confirm something for me.

345
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,083
So, Joe told me what you did.
I'm impressed.

346
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,376
(CHUCKLES) Oh, all I did was, you know,

347
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:44,915
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

348
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,917
and track Slick down from there.

How's it going with Joe?
Any closer to cracking his "no" code?

352
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,599
Are you kidding me?
He's like the permission Sphinx.

353

Or like a magic eight ball
with just one answer.

- To join your task force.
- No.

Well, maybe I can
put in a good word for you.

00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,780
That would mean a lot to me, Barry.

- Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
- lt's me.

Okay, so Slick wasn't in Central City

363

the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

364
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,250
He's lying.

365
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,303
He's a dirt bag and an arsonist,
but he's not lying about this.

366
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,592
He's not a meta, Barry.

367
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,927
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

368
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,310
Do you think it's possible
that the Slick in there has a...

369
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,098

broadcast from a Star City vigilante

has spawned a massive outcry...

373
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,780
Catchy.

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,818
I hate it
when they put a color in their name.

about the Sand Demon?

We don't even know anything about Zoom.
Or what is Zoom? ls Zoom even real?

Not yet, but we know how to now.

that Jay is a speedster?

I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

412

Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells.

413
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:13,458
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people,

414
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,167
because you believed in them.

415
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,135

they will follow your lead.

They'll do what you say.

But if they think
that you don't believe in them,

it won't be long
before they don't believe in you.

why you're so hell-bent I'm not?

to see your ugly mug around here again?

00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,066
Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer.
A woman that I know.

00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,480
And you need my help?

to fall apart if he becomes dehydrated.

- Exactly.

He creates a diversion,
then strikes when you're distracted.

Okay. Then what do we do?

446
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,923
We use your speed to get to him
before the distraction can happen.

who can slip through my fingers?

from the energy he creates when he runs.

00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,092
Irony is, I didn't want Patty to have
anything to do with the damn task force

462
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,713
in the first place.
And she gets taken because of me.

463
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,717
No, no, no.
This isn't your fault, all right?

It's hard not to think that.

You can't beat him.
I don't care what powers you have.

00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,834
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

471
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,416
Is that why you need to build
that concussive bomb?

00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,343
Yeah. I know what it is. I'm a cop.
I've seen one before.

Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

They only highlighted the worst parts
of who you already were.

Maybe not.

any draw upticks on the electrical grid.

Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid.

I figured out where Patty is.

501
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,444
And how, exactly, did you do that?

502
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,280
Just a hunch.

503
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,413

You'll get it. I believe in you.

The last person who helped me like this
was a man that I looked up to. Idolized.

00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,130
He taught me how to get faster,
how to get stronger,

00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,248
and I were attacking a speedster
on two fronts,

525
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,121
I would probably wanna slow you down,

526
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,828
like, by using a concussive bomb,
or something like that.

527
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,501
That's a good thought.
He's actually used one on me before.

528
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,000
His body absorbs the blast,
so it doesn't affect him.

it doesn't mean it's a worse one.

so thank you for all your help.

And for being so patient with me.

Anytime, kid. You're a quick study.

how to toss lightning, believe me.

Who is this guy?

610

No one knows. He showed up around
the same time as when I got my powers.

611
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,144
Killed a lot of people in my world.

612
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:10,199
I spent about two years tracking him down,
but he was too smart.

613
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,403
Too quick. He's always one step ahead.

614
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:18,663
You really think he'sjust
bringing these guys here to kill me?

615
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,496
Zoom was obsessed with destroying me.
Now he wants to destroy you?

616
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,751
Yeah.

617
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,922
He needs to be the best.

00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,554
And he will do whatever it takes
to ensure he's the only speedster.

619
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,681
In any world.

- JOE: Officer Spivot.
- Detective.

621
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,307
- You're supposed to be home resting.
- I'm okay, sir, really.

622
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,815
Look, I'm sorry you got mixed up
in all this mess because of me.

623
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,771
It's not your fault.

624
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,365
Do you really think you have
what it takes to be part of my task force?

625
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,112
I know it, sir.

626
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,242
Well, I always check the jacket
of anyone I'm considering for it.

627
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:00,416
In my research on you, I found out
we got a mutual acquaintance.

628
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,456
Mark Mardon.

629
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,507
I need you to be honest with me here.
Why do you want to do this?

630
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,760
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

631
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,762
He had a little shoe shop
down on Chesterfield.

632
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,724
It was a cash business,
and one night, he went to Fairfield Bank

633
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,277
to make his weekly deposit,
and the Mardon brothers showed up.

634
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,572
While he was waiting in line,
Mark shot my dad

635
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,403
in the face for a few hundred dollars.

636
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:42,367
Then, a few months later,
Mark and his brother got powers.

637
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,586
Two murderers got super powers.

638
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,539
So that's why I'm here, sir.

639
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:50,920
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

640
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,132
'Cause there's some bad people out there
and they can do anything.

641
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:02,432
And I may not have powers,
but I want to stop them.

642
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:07,230
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

643
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,400
Monday, 8:00 a.m.

Don't be late.

645
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,159
But, late for what?

Hi.

650
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:43,599
Been a long time.

651
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,733
Yeah, it has.

652
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,945
Why are you here?

653
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,655
Because you didn't return my calls.
And I wanted to see you.

654
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,659
And our daughter.

655
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,422
Any progress with the electrophotography?

656
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,922
The satellite picture
of the city's still rendering.

657
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,005
While we wait,
care to tell me what's going on with you?

658
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,340
What? Nothing.

659
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,717
Two hunches in one day.

Slick's locale and that he'd be using
a concussive bomb to thwart Barry.

661
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,811
Do I need to inform you of the odds
of such a prediction?

662
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:40,068
Something's happening to me.
I'm starting to perceive things.

663
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:44,746
Horrible things. lt started after
Wells killed me in the other timeline.

664
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,411
It came back
when Atom Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

665
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,963
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

666
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:58,257
I get a vibe, and then a vision
of something that's already happened.

667
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,338
And then it's gone.

668
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,347
That's how I knew where Slick was.

669
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,898
Cisco, this is amazing. We have to
study this. Figure outjust what to do to.

670
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,474
No, no, no, we're not doing any of that.

671
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,150
And we're certainly not
telling anybody either.

672
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,273
Cisco, lwould think
you'd be the one most intrigued

673
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,900
with knowing exactly what this is
and how it works!

674
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,827
I'm seeing things I don't want to see,
and knowing things I don't want to know.

675
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,277
I just want it to stop.

676
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:26,739
Professor, I don't want anyone
to know about this.

677
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,282
Not yet.

678
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,331
It's okay to be afraid, you know.

679
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,376
Wells told me this was in my future,

680
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,798
that he gave me this power.

681
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,059
But everything he did was evil.

682
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,972
That's what scares me, Professor.

683
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,851
You have to promise me
that you won't tell anyone about this.

684
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,478
I promise.

Oh, wow.

00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,824
It appears that while we were indeed
successful in closing the Singularity,

688
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,003
- there was an unfortunate side effect.
- What are you talking about?

689
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,047
Using electrophotography, Cisco and I
were able to search Central City

690
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,253
for any signs of energy
entering our Earth from another dimension.

691
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,635
From any breaches,
as Mr. Garrick described them.

692
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:27,717
But of course,
there isn'tjust one breach.

693
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,429
There's 52 of them,
scattered throughout the city.

694
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:36,143
Uh, these breaches are pockets of time
and space, folded into and upon itself.

695
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,197
But the most significant breach of all
appears to be this one.

696
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,822
And where exactly is that located?

697

It's here. Inside S.T.A.R. Labs.
