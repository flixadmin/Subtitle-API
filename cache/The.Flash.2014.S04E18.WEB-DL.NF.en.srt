- Yeah, smells like one too.

319
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,665
Guys, I think I figured out
DeVoe's plan.

320
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,042
He means to suffocate us
with BO and incense.

321
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,294
- Okay, well, this is the last
pocket dimension hotspot

322
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,713
on our list, so just...
do you see Gauss anywhere?

323
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,050

326
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,056
- Nope...
- Hm.

327
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,851
- I've seen the soul that
belongs to this man. [chuckles]

328
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,978
The dude's aura is a trip.

329
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,855
- Wait, so,
you know Edwin Gauss?

330
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,607
- Sure do.

331
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,153
'Round here, we call him...
the folded man.

332
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,323
- Folded man?
- He's everywhere...

333
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,410

334

search for Gauss.

Uh, stay in touch
over the comms.

340

my inner-penguin spirit animal

341

Don't touch anybody.

344
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,312
Okay, remember,
if we find Gauss first,

345
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,481
we might be able to put
an end to DeVoe's plans.

346
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,109
- Speaking of ending DeVoe...
- Not what I said.

347
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,402
- Allen, I'm just saying,

348
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,653
DeVoe's been ahead of us
at every turn.

349

His backup plans
have backup plans.

350
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,781
On the off chance
that we can't capture him,

351
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,284
shouldn't we be willing
to do whatever it takes?

352
