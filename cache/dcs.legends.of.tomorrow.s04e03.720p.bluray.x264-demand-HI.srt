Yes, of course, ma'am.

What kind of ripple effect
are we really looking at here, Nate?

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,871
Okay. Right now,
the Queen gets institutionalized,

the magic operations here.

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,318

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,119

In the meantime,

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,637
and they're compelled
to count every kernel.

160
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,915
Really? That sounds bizarre.
That's not true.

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,876
- Is that true?
- That's a stupid plan.

162
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,714
Have you got a better one, big man?

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,995
I don't do magic tricks.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,316
Oh, great. So the plan is no plan.
Is that you...

165
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,160
- Enough! Both of you.
- You know what?

166
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,360
It is 1977 in London town.
I'm gonna enjoy the sights.

167
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,239
Good luck with your magic problem.

168
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,715
Did you guys just
make Constantine leave?

169
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
We'll get back to you, Ray.

170
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,669
- Not your finest work, bud.
- He's gonna get us killed.

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,717
You just don't like guys with ties.

172
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,176
That's right. It's like a little flag
hanging from someone's neck

173
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,429
saying, "I'm a liar."

174
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,477
Look, I'll have
Zari follow him, all right?

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,950
But in the meantime,

176
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,096
you and I need to help Ray
find this magical creature,

177
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,874
so we can send it to hell
before this whole team falls apart.

178
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,838
- How's it going?
- Good.

179
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,956
Great.

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,160
[clears throat] All right.
This should be all of it.

181
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,830
These protocols were developed by Rip
and myself over the last six years.

182
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,997
- I did the drawings.
- Thank you, Gary.

183
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,754
So, your job is to just update

184
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,349
all of this for our new,
uh, magical fugitives, okay?

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,999
You got it, boss.
[clears throat]

186
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,198
And as we say at the Time Bureau,
the adventure is in the details.

187
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Have fun.

188
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
You okay?

189
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,560
Um...

190
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,711
I'm good. I'm good.

191
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,696
It's just... I know you guys
do things differently here.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,757
I just didn't know
it was so protocol-centric.

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,400
Look, I know you're used to
zooming around in a time machine...

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,896
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...with all your best friends,

196
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,673
shooting from the hip
and saving history.

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,395
- Always.
- But, you know,

198
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,917
the Bureau's not all protocols.

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,270
I'm listening.

200
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Come with.

201
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,436
Buckle up, Nate. It's Taco Monday.

202
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,830
Instead of Taco Tuesday?

203
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
Oh, we dare to defy.

204
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,754
- Whoa.
- Taco delivery.

205
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,672
Are you Mr. Green?

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,076
Oh, name's Gary.

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,039
Mr. Green's in the conservatory
with the lead pipe.

208
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,600
- Sorry. Bad joke.
- No, that was great.

209
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,990
Um... Yeah.

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
My name is Mona, by the way.

211
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Just kind of like <i>Mona Lisa</i>
without the Lisa, so it's just Mona.

212
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Cool.

213
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,834
Time Bureau. Ah.
Is that what this place is?

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,556
You know, they just never tell us.
What's a Time Bureau?

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,396
Uh... Um...

216
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,359
You know, like, daylight savings
and time zones and stuff like that?

217
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,476
We're in charge of that.

218
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,914
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

219
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,359
It's actually just one...

220
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,439
- Uh-oh.
- One per person.

221
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,994
Okay, bye.

222
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,316
Okay.

223
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,551
- Shh. Got it. Yeah.
- [Gary shushing]

224
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,713
What, did we forgot something
in the van?

225
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,632
No, I... Seeing as, um, I drove you guys
and you didn't pay me,

226
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,696
Uh, I thought maybe I could hang out
with you...

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
[in English accent]...blokes.

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
Down with the monarchy, right?

229
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,915
I didn't catch your name.

230
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,358
Rage.

231
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,949
- Rage?
- Yep, Rage. That's what they call me.

232
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,754
On account of all my various
rages, uh, against, um, the machine.

233
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,030
Oh.

234
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,077
I'd like to see some rage, Rage.

235
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,117
I'm Charlie. Come on in.

236
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Ha.

237
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,353
Guys, do you remember our driver?

238
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,036
Well, he goes by the name Rage,
because of his wicked rages.

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,072
Yeah? About what?

240
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Oh.

241
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,079
Disco music, right?

242
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
The Queen, obviously.

243
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,830
Doing chores in a timely fashion.

244
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,630
- We hate disco too.
- Yeah, hate disco. Hate it.

245
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,236
I had to move from New York
just to get away from

246
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,352
tight trousers
and platform shoes.

247
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,160
Do you know how hard it is
to walk in those?

248
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,954
- All right. Let's hear a rage then.
- Yeah, go on.

249
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,271
At this hour?
No, I don't like to force them.

250
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,592
You know, just let them
come naturally, but it'll happen.

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,912
What about you guys? You know, uh...

252
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,351
- What makes you tick?
- We're The Smell.

253
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,069
We're a band.
What more is there to say?

254
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,880
We're a bit more than that, Declan.

255
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,430
We're a movement.

256
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,155
We're gonna shock the system,
wake up all the drones.

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,674
Yeah, present company included.

258
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Oh. Oh!

259
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,478
Sorry, I got rice everywhere.
Sorry. You see that, Declan?

260
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
What?

261
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,196
The rice... The grains of rice,
they are everywhere.

262
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm sorry if you feel the urge to
have to pick up every single piece.

263
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,638
Mate, are you trying
the leprechaun test on me?

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,798
You know how hurtful
you're being right now? Deeply!

265
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,196
Declan's a bit touchy
about being ginger.

266
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,840
- You're all right, Rage.
- Well, Rage has got to leave.

267
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,437
We've got to plan
Operation Mum's Bum.

268
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,555
Mum's Bum. Mum-Mum's Bum? Hey.

269
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,240
Sounds fun. I could get into that.

270
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,755
Oh, we could use a driver.

271
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,039
- Can we trust him?
- There's only one way to find out.

272
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
[Nate] So, that's the big highlight?

273
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,760
Eating tacos one day before
the rest of America?

274
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

275
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh. Hey, there's a blip
on the magicometer.

276
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,117
It's from the Pleistocene period.

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,114
Clear your schedule.

278
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,519
We've got a report to write.

279
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Or, or, or...

280
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,955
[clears throat]
Or we can handle this ourselves.

281
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,189
Without approval?
That sounds dangerous.

282
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,393
You've got two, but I'm sort of
down to my last nipple.

283
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,120
Gary, Ava hired me
to optimize this department, okay,

284
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,238
and I can't do that
waiting three days for approval.

285
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,590
And we could be time bros.

286
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,709
- What?
- We could be time bros.

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,629
- Time bros?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,235
- Me and you?
- Mmm-hmm.

289
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,476
- Oh, but, um...
- We could re-heat your tacos later.

290
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,555
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

291
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,995
- This way.
- Okay.

292
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,272
[rock music playing on stereo]

293
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,309
Okay. Here we are.

294
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,349
Uh... Where are we?

295
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,078
St James's Park,
next to Buckingham Palace.

296
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,119
St James's Park, you say?

297
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,554
All right, Ray, we're listening.

298
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,714
The Queen's royal corgis are taking
their afternoon constitutional.

299
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,576
You're gonna nab
one of those little yippers

300
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,670
and bring him back to us.

301
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,096
Uh... We-we're not gonna
hurt the dog, are we?

302
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,032
No, we're gonna hurt the Queen.

303
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,080
She treats her dogs
to beef Wellington

304
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,560
while poor people are starving.

305
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,154
It's time to expose the hypocrisy.

306
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,597
Okay, yeah. No problem. Dogs love me.

307
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,750
[Sara] <i>Yes. Problem.</i>

308
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,880
They're the Queen's dogs.
They are gonna be guarded.

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,635
Question. Will the dogs
be heavily guarded?

310
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,434
Well, that's your problem.

311
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,920
It's time to see how far you'll go.

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,471
If you've got a rage stored up,
now is the time.

313
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,356
[scoffs]

Ray, we can hear you
gulping through the comms.

319
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,077
Do we really have to do this?

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,117
I mean, we know that
Declan's not a leprechaun.

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,237
Well, your machine says
one of them is magical,

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,835
so our job is to find them
and get it gone.

Gaining their trust
and betraying them.

326
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,279
We'll help you out with the corgis.

- QB.

Let's go, pups.
Pup-and-at-'em, Sparky.

333
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,240
You see that bench in front of you?

334
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
- [Ray] <i>Yeah.</i>
- Sit on it.

335
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
[Ray] <i>Okay.</i>

336
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,757
All right, Ray. I feel like
I should do, uh, something like, uh...

337
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,071
- Maybe a distraction?
- Just wait.

338
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,670
This would go a lot faster
if you'd just do your thing, Gordon.

Can we just nick his van already?

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,754
That's why we're here, innit?

346
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,990
Give him a minute.

00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,201
Mick, you were right.
It's just the dog walker now.

349
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,034
Go and ask for the corgi.

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,675
Ah. Excuse me, sir.

351
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,956
I, uh... I don't know
if this is royal etiquette,

352
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,874
but if it may please the Crown,

353
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,871
may I, uh, borrow one of those corgis?

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,116
Just take him.

355
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh.

356
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,841
There are those famous
British manners I've heard of.

357
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,990
Thank you.

358
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Good choice.

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,480
Well, how long do you think
the poor lad is gonna last in the clink?

He did it. He bloody did it.

This isn't a tattoo.
It's a statement.

You tell her you have four roommates
and sleep on the couch?

[Constantine] No, I didn't.

naked without a clever costume on.

Oh, I'm sort off of costumes
right now.

[Gary] Well, he dropped me, which sucks.

I mean, you know.

436
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,590
Why would you say that?

437
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,474
Oh, there's no shame in it.

438
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,796
You know, I used to just think
of you as Amaya's arm-candy,

439
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,112
so it's nice to know you're
more than just the guy Amaya dumped.

440

She didn't dump me.
We broke up to save the timeline.

Yeah, Constantine
let me down easy too.

Said it was about
the balance of good and evil.

443

Wait. Did she dump me?

444
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,074
Well, all I know is that she started
a family with another guy, real fast.

445
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,629
You tell me. But, hey, hey.

change up your scenery a bit...

- On three.
- Yes.

[whispering] Psst. It's me, Ray.
Look straight ahead.

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Talk straight into your newspaper.

463
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,714
No one will suspect a thing.

464

What do you got on them?

465

Gilly loves monkeys,

466

Ian's first language was Yiddish,

I'll have to off.

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,638
Well, it appears that
Charlie is our "myth-ery"

471
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
or fugitive.

472
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,630
Good.

473
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,473
We'll nab her and send her to hell.

474
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,118
Hell? What...

475
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,709
Look, all she's guilty of is
questionable hygiene,

476
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,634
playing bad music,
and pulling a couple pranks.

477
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,110
We started this mess,
we gotta take care of it.

478
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,190
All right, well...

479
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,536
Just give me some time to figure out

480
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,313
what her powers are
before we move on her.

481

You've got until the weasel
gets back.

What the hell is that on your arm?

483
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,870
It's my tattoo.

484
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,597
It's a corgi with a mohawk.
[laughs]

485

You've lost it, Haircut.

486
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,910
Finally lost it.

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,555
It's Rage, mate.

488
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,720
Were you and your mom close?

489
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,239
Just met her 20 minutes ago.

490

Died in childbirth.

Two for two. Sorry.

492
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,799
My dad used to call me "Killer."

493
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,439
Never let me forget what I did.

494
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,639
- Hmm. Father of the year.
- Mmm.

495
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
You wouldn't guess that
to look at him, would you?

[both chuckle]

You didn't just happen
to run into your parents, did you?

498
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,394
I've ruined a lot of lives,

499
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,515
and that bastard's just the first one
to call me out on it.

500

Listen, if you're going to wallow
in self-pity,

501

the <i>Waverider's</i> got a lot of rooms
for that.

502

I'm partial to the kitchen myself.

503

Oh, I'm not here to wallow, love.
[clears throat]

I'm here to fix it.

I'm gonna give him
the old Manchester Mengele.

- What?
- Back-alley vasectomy.

What happened?

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,195
Ball-kick paradox.

512
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,696
You can't kick your own dad
in the junk

513
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,456
because you'd erase yourself
from the timeline,

514
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,960
which means there would be
no one to kick your dad in the junk.

Bloody hell, I can't.

Get the hell out of my pub!

There's a lot of things

If that is your real name,

for stealing corgis.

00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,200
Wow.

632
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:03,160
Must be strange to completely change.

633
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,356
It is.

634
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,477
That's why I have to hold tight
to what I believe.

635
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,995
Strong drinks, loud music,
and screwing the system.

636
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,438
Otherwise I'd lose myself.

637
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,073
You're a pretty cool lady.

638
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,870
Or man. Or whatever you wanna be.

639
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,314
I wish the humans who threw me
in the slammer felt that way.

640
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,910
They just saw a magical creature
and panicked.

641
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,669
I'm so sorry.

642
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,435
Oh, don't be.

643
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,273
You're one of the good ones,
Just Ray.

644
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
[sighs]

645
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,878
Sara, I figured it out.

646
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,998
All right, Ray,
what are we dealing with?

647
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,434
[Ray] <i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

648
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,160
<i>She doesn't kidnap the Queen,
she becomes the Queen.</i>

649
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,197
- I knew it.
- He definitely said leprechaun.

650
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,075
[Ray] <i>So I have an idea.</i>

651
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,675
What if I just ask her to stop
impersonating the Queen?

652
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,479
History goes back to the way it was,

653
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,114
and we don't have
to send her to hell.

654
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,376
Ray, so far we've learned that

655
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,916
unicorns are homicidal maniacs
and fairy godmothers are psychopaths.

656
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,616
And they're supposed to be
the nice ones.

657
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,154
And these shapeshifting bastards,

658
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,550
they put the rest to shame.
We're talking killing sprees,

659
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,040
<i>world wars, you name it.</i>

660
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,536
Yeah, but she's not doing
any of that.

661
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,280
She's manipulating you.
Don't fall for it, mate.

662
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,317
Too late. He's got a tattoo.

663
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,233
Oh, please let it be a tramp stamp.

664
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,320
She's not hurting anyone.

665
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,631
Sit tight, Haircut.
We'll, uh, work this out.

666
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,753
[Ray] <i>Thank you, Mick. Maybe we could...</i>

667
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,710
He's in too deep.

668
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,990
For once, I agree with you.

669
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,119
Ray has no bloody idea
what he's dealing with.

670
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,793
Ray has been doing this a long time.

671
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,916
He can handle himself.

672
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,072
Sara, if this thing gets loose,
there is no stopping it. Trust me.

673
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,240
Zari, what do you think?
Has the shapeshifter gotten to Ray?

674
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,796
Yeah.

675
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,070
All right, then.
Squad save the Queen.

676

[dog barking in distance]

678
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,875
That's not the plan.

679
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,112
- Do you trust me?
- Of course.

680
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,714
- You are my friend.
- We gotta go.

681
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,910
What? Why?

682
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,434
Because my friends don't trust me.

683
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,199
Ray, we just wanna talk.

684
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,792
So your disco mates
think I'll come quietly.

685
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,430
Who are you, really?

686
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,800
Look, Declan was right.
I am a narc. I'm a magic narc.

687
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,760
I was sent here to capture you
and take you in, but...

688
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,120
- You ain't sending me back to prison.
- I'm not gonna do it.

689
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,236
[Mick] Haircut!

690
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
[sighs]

691
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
Then what are you gonna do?

692
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,440
[Ray] You told me that you wanted
to shock people and wake them up.

693
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,515
That's what I'm gonna do
to my own team.

694
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
You asked me who I really am?

695
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,316
I'm a punk.

696
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,799
Come on, Ray, open the door.

697
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Or we burn it down.

698
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
[Mick grunts]

699
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,558
Ah, lunch is here. Yes!

700
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,150
Hey, I have an idea for you guys.

701
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,471
- Who guys?
- You guys, the Time Bureau.

702
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
[Gary] Oh.

703
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,875
Sorry, that was supposed
to be top secret.

704
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,272
No worries, because I was thinking,

705
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,996
you know how time zones
go up and down?

706
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,390
Well, what about sideways?

707
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,914
Sideways time zones?

708
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,150
Huh? Like across?

709
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,896
So you wouldn't have
to change your clock

710
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,231
- when you took a solo...
- [both]...road trip across America!

711
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,518
- That's genius.
- Thanks.

712
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
What is happening?

713
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Sorry I have to do this.

714
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,319
[Nate] And have a nice day.

715
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,354
Okay, you got a sandwich.

716
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,389
I got a sandwich.

Pro tip. Bureau pays for lunch,

718
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,550
so make sure you eat enough
so you're not hungry again

until tomorrow.

720

You really do know
all the boring tricks.

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,959
I can see you're in a funk.
Is this still about Amaya?

722
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,919
Lay it on the Gare Bear.

723
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,593
It's okay to cry. In fact...

724
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,840
It's encouraged.

It's from our first mission together.

729
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,595
I wanted it to have
a special meaning for us.

- Sara?
- Mmm.

Maybe you should have put a tracker
in her comm.

00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>Bring it on! Come on down here!</i>

792
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,360
You can't just leave her
locked in there forever.

793
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,638
You are on thin ice in terms of
what we can and cannot do.

794
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,712
Those punks were
a bad influence on you.

795
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,840
Oh, well, maybe you just don't know
as much about me as you think you do.

796
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,599
You were an Eagle Scout,
former CEO of Palmer Tech.

797
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,912
Your favorite musical
is <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

798
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,559
You're allergic to cats and Grodd.

799
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,438
And you were knighted
by Queen Guinevere,

800
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

801
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,232
- Okay, so you know a lot.
- Yeah.

802
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,597
But you don't know that I was the man

803
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,592
who helped Nora Darhk
escape the Time Bureau.

804
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
You what?

805
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,959
She's not gonna
sleep with you, Haircut.

806
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,910
That is not why I did it.

807
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,911
I just...
I believe she can be a better person.

808
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,469
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's
a terrible, horrible monster,

809
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,440
but I believe she should be given
the chance to find out.

810
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,955
Everyone else on this ship
has been given a second chance.

811
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Why doesn't she get one?

812
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,240
[sighs]

813
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,197
Look, you better not be wrong about her.

814
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,079
But right now, we need to deal
with our current captive.

815
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,799
She cannot stay on this ship.

816
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,798
Yeah, especially not with Amaya's face.

817
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,036
It's freaking creepy.

818
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,034
You broke her, you fix her, weasel.

819
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,190
Make her not Amaya again.

820
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,918
Spell doesn't work like that, Womble.

821
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,030
I took away her power to transform.

822
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,036
It's like clipping an angel's wings.
You can't exactly unclip them.

823
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Whoo!

824
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,232
That was one surprisingly
strong little plant.

825
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,636
Surprisingly full of goo.

826
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,240
I like what you've done
with the place.

827
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,956
Sort of
a Little Office of Horrors theme.

828
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,671
Nate showed the plant who's boss,
Captain Lance.

829
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,513
- Oh, yeah?
- Although the plant did get in

830
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,398
- a lot of punches...
- Okay, Gar-Gar.

831
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,136
All right, let's leave a little
something to the imagination.

832
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,736
Speaking of, you should probably
change your shirt

833
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,880
before Ava gets back.
I can see where your nipple was.

834
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
And the handshake.

835
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,595
Oh.

836
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,956
You already found a new time bro.

837
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,190
He's growing on me.

838
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,920
Okay, but really, when are you
coming back to the ship?

839
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,118
There's a situation that I could
really use your input on.

840
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,318
[clears throat]
When I took this job at the Time Bureau,

841
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,029
I thought I was doing it
for my dad or even maybe

842
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,278
a little bit for Ava,
but, um, the truth is

843
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,278
I was trying to avoid the <i>Waverider.</i>

844
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,436
Why?

845
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,512
Because every room
I went into on that ship,

846
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,353
I was hoping she'd be there.

847
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,678
- Amaya?
- Yeah.

848
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,280
But I'm over it.

849
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,590
Amaya is no longer on the <i>Waverider.</i>

850
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,075
That's it.

851
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,077
I'm sorry.
You wanted to talk about something.

852
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Um...

853
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,557
No. It can... It'll wait.

854
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,190
Maybe a little Bureau time
is exactly what you need.

855
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,358
So I think you should stay here,

856
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,309
because I like to watch you grow.

857
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,471
- Mmm. Thank you, Sara.
- [Sara] Yeah.

858
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Hi.

859
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,790
Uh, wow...

860
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
[clicks tongue]

861
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,879
So, enough chit-chat.

862
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,320
Dinner? Drinks?

863
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,576
- Should we just get straight to it?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

864
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,360
What did I say about
professional boundaries?

865
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Sorry.

866
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,150
I mean, look at this place.

867
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,070
Can you please tell me

868
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,311
how do you keep five Legends
on a leash at once?

869
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,160
Very loosely.

870
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,597
Because sometimes
we pull you in the right direction.

871
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,114
Hey, you got a minute?

872
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,995
I just wanted to say, about the pub...

873
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

874
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,393
Listen, if you're here to have
some weepy heart-to-heart

875
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,960
end-of-the-mission hug fest

876
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,256
where you tell me that
my problems are your problems and that

877
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,590
happiness is just one friend away,
and all that bollocks,

878
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,149
don't bother, yeah.

879
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,072
Hey, you don't know me.

880
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,157
I wouldn't do that.
That would be lame.

881
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,230
Yeah, it would.

882
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,390
So, why are you here?

883
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
I wanted to give you

884
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
this surveillance photo
I took of you and your mom.

885
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,156
Thank you.

886
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,797
You know,
for not doing any of that stuff.

887
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,560
Yeah, anytime.

888
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Yeah.

889
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,080
[sighs]

890
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:31,355
I hate cops.

891
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
[Ray scoffs]

892
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,280
I am well aware of that, Mick.

893
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,432
Well, today we nearly became cops.

894
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,633
Yeah, but we didn't.

895
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,871
No. Thanks to you.

896
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,513
- Rage.
- Aw. Thanks, Mick.

897
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
All right, are you two plonkers

898
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,479
just gonna stand there
and stare at me?

899
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,756
Or is one of you gonna
pour me a bloody pint?

900
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,797
She definitely isn't Amaya.

901
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Bah!

902
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,756
No, but I do like her.

903
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,152
[theme music playing]
