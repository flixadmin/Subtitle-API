1
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,690
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,443
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,494
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:17,745
I know.

5
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:19,831
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,499
Perfect.

7
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,418
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:25,044
It's great.

9
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,338
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:30,008
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,135
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,679
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,348
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:38,558
Coming.

15
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,019
All right.

16
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,478
I'm ready.

17
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,206
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,332
Roz.

19
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,754
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,798
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,301
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,137
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,264
-What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,100
-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:24,395
-No, darling.
-it'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,814
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,776
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,736
We shouldn't be later than 1 :00.

29
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,656
-I'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,241
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,869
-Good night, sweetheart.
-See you in the morning.

32
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,423
-Victor, Illona.
-Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,176
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:55,552 --> 00:03:00,014
-Thanks so much for coming.
-We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,309
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,436
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,397
-Yes, he does.
-He does?

38
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,608
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:14,195
-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,906
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,534
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,453
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,468
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,306
Not a soul.

45
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,610
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,199
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,587
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,216
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,884
Really?

50
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,640
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,019
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,608
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,153
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 1 0 minutes.

54
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:38,988
Thank you.

55
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,081
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,708
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,838
You go and say hello, and
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,381
Good.

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,393
Nightingale.

60
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,353
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,897
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,192
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,946
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,489
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,908
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

66
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,165
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,251
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,171
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,673
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,426
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,888
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:49,142
You know what they say:
""Once a doctor, always a doctor. ""

73
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,646
Yes, or in my case:
""Never a doctor, never a doctor. ""

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,900
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,986
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,404
Cheers.

77
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,408
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,243
Be right with you.

79
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:10,121
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,125
... I'll be down at the Village
For two weeks at the Sonata Café.

81
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,003
-Stop by if you get a chance.
-I'll be there.

82
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,798
-it's great seeing you.
-Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,718
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:09,055
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,073
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,128
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,505
I'm American.

88
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,091
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:51,431
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:57,187
Didn't he wind up all by himself...?

91
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,148
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:04,110
...in some place with
a very bad climate?

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,239
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,034
A very good time.

95
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,289
Are you here with
anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,419
With my husband.

97
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,671
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:29,344
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,351
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:40,313
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,441
... I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:48,404
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,157
But it went broke.

104
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,869
What a shame.

105
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,082
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,001
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,423
Thank you.

108
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,236
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,783
My...

110
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:35,785
... Husband.

111
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,543
Don't you think one of
the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:48,381
... Is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:54,929
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:59,142
...who could have any man in
this room, wants to be married?

115
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:04,063
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,984
is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,571
As good as that.

118
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,157
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:18,995
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,999
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,546
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,009
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,763
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:40,725
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:46,397
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,191
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:52,612
-And you got something in your eye.
-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,533
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,244
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:04,624
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,711
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:12,465
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:17,178
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:21,182
...and be free to do what
they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,435
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,109
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,825
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,955
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:48,293
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,753
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,592
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,678
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,765
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:07,061
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:10,315
You're probably right.

146
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:16,112
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,323
Exactly?

148
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,328
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,788
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:29,459
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,754
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,631
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,675
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:42,180
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:45,683
Fine.

156
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:48,853
To be continued?

157
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,753
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,633
We had a little accident here.

159
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,385
What happened?

160
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,846
Well, she was...

161
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:27,517
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,520
What did she take?

163
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:35,024
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,068
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,031
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:45,869
Anything else?

167
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:50,790
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:52,959
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,629
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:57,964
What's her name?

171
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,341
Mandy.

172
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,769
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,733
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:21,321
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,114
You can hear me.

176
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:27,535
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,581
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,792
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:37,837
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,758
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:44,427
Good.

182
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,305
Good.

183
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:52,560
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,358
It's wonderful.

185
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,862
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:08,868
I haven't.

187
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:14,457
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,795
Do you like the period?

189
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,675
I do.

190
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,469
I adore it.

191
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,015
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,477
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:39,357
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,863
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,080
Maybe...

196
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,878
...not just...

197
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,463
...now.

198
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:24,777
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,697
Sorry.

200
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,833
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,003
Better.

202
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:56,059
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,603
You know that?

204
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,440
I know.

205
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,777
You're gonna be okay this time.

206
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,281
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:12,534
You understand?

208
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:20,875
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:24,254
I know.

210
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:36,641
Well, Victor...

211
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,395
... I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:43,314
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:47,235
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:48,903
Another hour?

215
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,825
Then have someone take her home.

216
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:01,374
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,504
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,507
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

219
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:12,135
Bill, I probably... .

220
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:16,472
I know I don't have to mention this...

221
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:19,642
... but this is just between us.

222
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,394
Of course.

223
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,146
Thanks.

224
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:48,796
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:55,553
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:55,762 --> 00:19:00,391
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:04,312
Yes...

228
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,357
...but will I?

229
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,692
Of course you will.

230
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:18,701
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,703
You don't, you know.

232
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,041
Yes, I do.

233
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,215
I must see you again.

234
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,636
-That's impossible.
-Why?

235
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,848
Because...

236
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,727
...I'm married.

237
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,044
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:53,379
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,508
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,343
-Sure.
-Thank you.

241
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,888
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

242
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,183
""'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,228
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. ""

244
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,984
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,407
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:24,786
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:27,622
Does this hurt?

248
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:43,221
Right there?

249
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,067
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,528
Very good choice.

251
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,614
""--before me...

252
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:07,078
...when I jump into my bed. ""

253
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,251
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,087
I've taken care of that.

255
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,048
Good.

256
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:23,386
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,265
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:15,480
Tell me something.

259
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:23,738
Those two girls...

260
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,201
...at the party last night... .

261
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,042
Did you...

262
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,420
...by any chance...

263
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:42,131
...happen to...

264
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,594
...fuck them?

265
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:50,557
What?

266
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:56,145
What are you talking about?

267
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,820
I'm talking about the two girls...

268
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:07,991
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:12,745
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,792
Who were they?

271
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:24,757
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:33,349
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,518
Wait a minute.

274
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:43,902
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:49,324
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:53,036
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:59,792
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:08,843
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:12,931
What did he want?

280
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,225
What did he want?

281
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,566
Sex...

282
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,570
...upstairs.

283
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:30,532
Then and there.

284
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,494
Is that all?

285
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,413
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:40,416
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,256
That's right.

288
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,883
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:54,055
Understandable?

290
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,100
Because you are a very...

291
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,311
...very beautiful woman.

292
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:04,774
Wait.

293
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,446
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

294
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:14,951
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:26:16,828 --> 00:26:21,166
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

296
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,631
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

297
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:35,638
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,642
So on that basis...

299
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:44,856
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:49,819
There are exceptions.

301
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:55,366
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,789
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:05,460
...I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:08,129
And because we're married...

305
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:12,634
...and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,886
...or hurt you.

307
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:26,606
Do you realize that
what you' re saying...

308
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:30,193
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

309
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,987
...is out of consideration for me?

310
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:36,241
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:39,369
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:42,163
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:45,792
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,628
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:51,422
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,843
I don't even know what
we're arguing about here.

317
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,262
I'm not arguing.

318
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:02,517
I'm just trying to find out
where you' re coming from.

319
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,477
Where I'm coming from?

320
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:13,653
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,991
...standing in your office naked...

322
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,869
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:22,871
Now, what I want to know... .

324
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,084
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you' re squeezing them.

325
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:32,422
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:35,216
It's all very impersonal...

327
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:39,012
...and you know there's
always a nurse present.

328
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:44,434
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:45,685
Exactly.

330
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:50,440
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

331
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:55,904
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

332
00:28:56,112 --> 00:28:58,364
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

333
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:02,869
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:09,250
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

335
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:13,713
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:15,840
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:22,889
If for no better reason...

338
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,392
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:32,065
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,526
What then?

341
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:38,154
I don't know, Alice... .

342
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:40,990
What then?

343
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:46,830
Women don't...

344
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:51,543
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:57,382
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,678
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

347
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:05,098
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,559
...and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:11,521
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:15,692
If you men only knew.

351
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:21,197
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

352
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:24,534
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,870
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:28,246
No, I'm not.

355
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:30,540
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,749
No, I haven't.

357
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,460
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:38,631
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

359
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,217
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

360
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:44,220
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,725
You are very, very sure of yourself...

362
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,226
... aren't you?

363
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:51,895
No.

364
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,397
I'm sure of you.

365
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,536
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:19,255
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:23,843
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:36,773
Do you...

369
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:42,612
Do you remember last
summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:52,622
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

371
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,999
...there was this young naval officer...

372
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:59,796
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:32:01,297 --> 00:32:02,340
No.

374
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:09,180
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:12,058
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:20,024
Well...

377
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:26,030
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:29,492
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:33,246
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:35,915
... to the elevator.

381
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,841
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:47,844
Nothing more.

383
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,313
But I could hardly...

384
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,524
...move.

385
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:12,744
That afternoon...

386
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,083
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:24,964
...and you and I made love.

388
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,555
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:37,727
...and we talked about Helena.

390
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,105
And yet...

391
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:44,943
...at no time...

392
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:48,863
...was he ever...

393
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:53,827
...out of my mind.

394
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,170
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:08,508
...even if it was only...

396
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,011
...for one night...

397
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:20,019
...I was ready to give up everything.

398
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,106
You.

399
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,151
Helena.

400
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:33,533
My whole fucking future.

401
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:37,412
Everything.

402
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:48,339
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:52,260
...you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:59,893
And at that moment, my love for you...

405
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,771
...was both...

406
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:11,196
...tender and sad.

407
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:24,876
I barely slept that night...

408
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:31,090
...and I woke up the
next morning in a panic.

409
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:37,180
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,018
...or that he might still be there.

411
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:49,567
But by dinner...

412
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:56,074
...I realized he was gone...

413
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:04,749
...and I was...

414
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,710
...relieved.

415
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:38,449
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,624
When did it happen?

417
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:54,966
I have the address.

418
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:57,093
Thank you.

419
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,061
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:18,615
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:15,213
-Hello, Rosa.
-Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:20,510
-How is Miss Nathanson?
-Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:21,803
Thank you.

424
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,361
Come in.

425
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:45,743
Marion...

426
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,414
Oh, Dr. Harford...

427
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:52,959
How good of you to come.

428
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,628
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,046
Thank you.

430
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,217
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

431
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,261
Your father was...

432
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:07,265
He was a very brave man.

433
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,517
Oh, thank you.

434
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:11,936
How are you holding up?

435
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,940
I'm a bit numb.

436
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:19,152
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:22,697
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:54,687
It's so unreal.

439
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,066
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:04,656
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,786
Then he had a little dinner...

442
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:13,498
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:19,629
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:24,092
...and when I went to see how he was...

445
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:26,678
...I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:35,687
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:43,069
From what you've said...

448
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:47,323
...I'm sure your father died
peacefully in his sleep.

449
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:51,327
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:58,501
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,254
...than his death itself.

452
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:05,800
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:41:08,011 --> 00:41:12,390
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:15,852
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

455
00:41:16,102 --> 00:41:18,938
...and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:26,529
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:30,992
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,244
A math professor.

459
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:39,876
We're going to get married in May.

460
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:45,840
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,054
Thank you.

462
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:57,352
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,646
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,484
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:14,077
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,932
Oh, my God, no... .

467
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:57,620
I love you.

468
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:01,457
I love you.

469
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,419
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:07,630
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:10,008
Marion, I don't think you realize--

472
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:11,509
I do.

473
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:16,764
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:20,518
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:26,608
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you' re saying.

476
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,819
I love you.

477
00:43:31,196 --> 00:43:34,115
We barely know each other.

478
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:38,786
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:40,705
I love you.

480
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:48,755
That's probably Carl.

481
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:52,091
Please don't despise me.

482
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:59,974
-Hello, Rosa.
-Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:44:01,643 --> 00:44:04,979
-is she in the bedroom?
-Yes, she is.

484
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:06,272
Thank you.

485
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:18,785
Come in.

486
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:25,291
Darling.

487
00:44:29,254 --> 00:44:31,339
I'm so very sorry.

488
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:33,800
Are you all right?

489
00:44:34,384 --> 00:44:35,885
I'm okay.

490
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:41,307
-Dr. Harford, good evening.
-Good evening, Carl.

491
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:44,435
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:47,564
-it's the least I could do.
-it means a lot to us.

493
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:49,023
Thank you.

494
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:56,739
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:00,743
Marion...

496
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,622
...your father was very proud of you...

497
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:09,919
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:45:11,337 --> 00:45:12,630
Thank you.

499
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,431
I'll show you out.

500
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,310
Good night.

501
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,652
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,363
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:21,950
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:46:22,158 --> 00:46:24,035
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,663
-Looks like the pink team.
-Look at this faggot!

506
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,623
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:31,167
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:33,962
-Your butt-brothers are back there!
-Prime cut of meat!

509
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:37,674
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:41,678
You should have tits,
you' re standing so close!

511
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,974
-I got dumps that are bigger than you!
-Come on, macho man!

512
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:49,435
-You want a piece of this, baby?
-Exit only, honey.

513
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:53,231
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:18,631
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,259
Ten past 12.

516
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:25,471
Going anywhere special?

517
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:28,892
No, I'm just taking a walk.

518
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,065
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,985
I'm sorry?

520
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:42,155
Have a little fun?

521
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,909
I just live right down there.

522
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:49,287
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:47:50,413 --> 00:47:52,624
Come inside with you?

524
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:58,880
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:07,847
You live in there?

526
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,310
By yourself?

527
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:15,271
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:18,233
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,069
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:23,613
It's okay. Come on.

531
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:25,448
Come on.

532
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:52,976
This is it.

533
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:58,648
That's a nice tree.

534
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:08,700
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:24,841
It's...

536
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,844
...cozy. It's a...

537
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,180
...cozy place.

538
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:32,724
It's okay.

539
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:52,952
Do you suppose we should
talk about money?

540
00:49:53,703 --> 00:49:55,205
Yeah, I guess so.

541
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:58,958
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:05,006
What do you want to do?

543
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:11,095
What do you recommend?

544
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:17,602
What do I recommend?

545
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:35,119
I'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:40,083
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,377
I'm in your hands.

548
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:47,841
And how does 1 50 sound?

549
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:51,344
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:59,310
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:08,069
Thank you.

552
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:09,279
Prego, Prego.

553
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:11,781
-Grazie.
-You're welcome.

554
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,243
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

555
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:00,872
Shall we?

556
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:20,600
Excuse me.

557
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:36,699
Is everything all right?

558
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:43,873
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,380
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:52:51,214 --> 00:52:53,091
It could be awhile.

561
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,719
Any idea how long?

562
00:52:57,554 --> 00:53:00,014
No, I don't really know.

563
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,142
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:09,440
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

565
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,504
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,276
Do you have to go?

567
00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:56,696
Do I have to go?

568
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,036
I think I do.

569
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,248
Are you sure?

570
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:15,632
Yes, I'm afraid so.

571
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:21,804
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

572
00:54:22,305 --> 00:54:26,684
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:34,150
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

574
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:35,819
No, it's all right.

575
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:39,864
-No, really. You don't have to.
-No, I want to.

576
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,409
Really?

577
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:47,956
Well, thank you very much.

578
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:33,877
Thank you.

579
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:51,686
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

580
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:54,731
-I'd like a table.
-Please follow me.

581
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:05,074
-Can I take your coat?
-Thank you.

582
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:08,244
Could I get you anything to drink?

583
00:56:09,412 --> 00:56:11,748
-I'd like a beer.
-Certainly.

584
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,761
One, two, one-two-three-four.

585
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:28,223
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:33,144
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

587
00:56:33,353 --> 00:56:37,440
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

588
00:56:37,649 --> 00:56:41,861
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

589
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:44,656
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

590
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,627
-Nick, that was great.
-Thanks.

591
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:01,339
-Nightingale.
-Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:05,093
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:08,346
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:12,141
-What are you drinking?
-A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:14,769
Thank you.

596
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:18,815
So what brings you out at this hour?

597
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:22,193
-I have a patient in the neighborhood.
-You live in the Village?

598
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:25,321
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

599
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,948
You're married?

600
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:28,950
Nine years.

601
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:32,328
-Any kids?
-Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

602
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:33,580
How about you?

603
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:36,416
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

604
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:38,001
You're a long way from home.

605
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:41,129
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

606
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:42,964
Thank you.

607
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:51,472
-is this your band?
-No, it's a pick-up band.

608
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:55,727
-Who do you normally play with?
-Anybody, anywhere.

609
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:58,438
I got another gig later tonight.

610
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:00,565
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:58:00,773 --> 00:58:02,484
They only get started around 2.

612
00:58:03,276 --> 00:58:04,486
in the Village?

613
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:10,116
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

614
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,576
You don't?

615
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:16,998
No. it may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

616
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:20,001
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,879
-A different place every time?
-So far.

618
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,215
What's the big mystery?

619
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:29,260
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

620
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:36,226
Nick, I'm sorry.
is there something I'm missing here?

621
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,106
I play blindfolded.

622
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:44,400
What?

623
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,822
I play blindfolded.

624
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,410
You're putting me on.

625
00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:57,080
No, it's the truth.

626
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:02,710
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:06,798
Oh, man.

628
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:12,303
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

629
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,347
...but never...

630
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:17,141
...never anything like this...

631
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,937
...and never such women.

632
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:32,448
Excuse me.

633
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:39,372
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:47,046
I know where that is.

635
00:59:54,637 --> 00:59:55,597
Right.

636
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:01,144
Well, I'm on my way right now.

637
01:00:01,895 --> 01:00:04,439
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
01:00:06,858 --> 01:00:08,151
What is this?

639
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:12,363
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,828
it's the password.

641
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:21,080
The password?

642
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:26,002
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:30,882
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

644
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:39,891
You know there is no way on earth...

645
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,853
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:48,191
-Come on, buddy, give me a break.
-Nick, I'll tell you what.

647
01:00:48,399 --> 01:00:51,653
I've already got the password.

648
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,740
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

649
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:59,536
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:06,417
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

651
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:09,587
...that I was prepared to do that.

652
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:13,258
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:15,760
Why not?

654
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:20,515
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:25,019
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:47,125
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:02,557
Yes? Who is it?

658
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:04,517
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

659
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:09,147
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

660
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:12,192
Who is it that you want?

661
01:02:13,776 --> 01:02:16,738
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

662
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:19,449
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

663
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:23,077
What's your name?

664
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,622
My name is Bill Harford.

665
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,041
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

666
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,960
You are Grenning's doctor?

667
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,298
Okay.

668
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,300
Just a moment.

669
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:54,567
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

670
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:56,361
Yes, I am.

671
01:02:56,861 --> 01:03:00,740
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:03,743
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:08,456
I wasn't aware of that.

674
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:14,003
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:15,839
Yes, I am.

676
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:17,215
Well, first of all...

677
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:22,345
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr.

678
01:03:22,554 --> 01:03:23,763
Milich.

679
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:28,143
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

680
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,354
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

681
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:35,233
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:03:35,441 --> 01:03:38,862
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,197
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

684
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,326
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

685
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:52,292
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

686
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,546
And I'd be happy to pay you
$ 1 00 over the rental price...

687
01:03:56,754 --> 01:03:58,423
...for the inconvenience.

688
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:01,551
A hundred dollars?

689
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:06,723
I don't think so.

690
01:04:10,185 --> 01:04:12,061
How about $200?

691
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:15,231
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:28,328
Come in.

693
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,418
Can't be too careful these days.

694
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:39,797
Please.

695
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,470
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

696
01:04:48,515 --> 01:04:53,478
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

697
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:56,981
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:03,404
I think we'll find something for you.

699
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:05,824
Follow me, please.

700
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:07,367
Good.

701
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:18,503
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:05:20,255 --> 01:05:22,257
-it's wonderful.
-Come.

703
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:25,593
So what color cloak?

704
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:28,763
Red, brown, red?

705
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,224
Black.

706
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,978
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:37,814
-I don't think so.
-Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:40,692
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

709
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,153
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:05:45,613 --> 01:05:47,115
May I take your coat?

711
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:52,287
-You are medicine doctor, yes?
-Yes, I am.

712
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:57,083
-I have some problem with my hair.
-Your hair?

713
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:59,335
It's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:02,463
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,674
Look at this. Here.

716
01:06:06,009 --> 01:06:07,135
You see?

717
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:09,012
And?

718
01:06:09,888 --> 01:06:12,140
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:14,350
What? You can't help me?

720
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,146
No. You should see a trichologist.
it's a hair specialist.

721
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:21,983
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:06:22,192 --> 01:06:23,902
So if you don't mind--

723
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,196
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:06:26,404 --> 01:06:27,697
I understand.

725
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:30,283
So black cloak?

726
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:36,623
Did you hear something?

727
01:06:39,918 --> 01:06:41,503
What is this?

728
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:53,014
What is it?

729
01:06:58,102 --> 01:07:00,063
What is this?

730
01:07:13,785 --> 01:07:16,454
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:18,790
Milich, I can explain everything.

732
01:07:18,998 --> 01:07:21,292
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:07:21,501 --> 01:07:23,294
I promise I'll kill you!

734
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:27,423
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:31,427
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:07:31,636 --> 01:07:35,265
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

737
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:39,853
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,856
-You will have to explain to police!
-To the police?!

739
01:07:43,064 --> 01:07:45,900
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

740
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:49,696
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

741
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:52,073
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:56,202
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:58,538
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:00,331
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:03,376
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:06,254
You will please stay here
until I return.

747
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:08,047
Let us out of here!

748
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,175
That's out of the question.

749
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:13,970
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,763
-Black?
-Black.

751
01:08:16,473 --> 01:08:20,101
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,520
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

753
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:23,646
Sorry.

754
01:08:24,272 --> 01:08:27,817
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,403
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

756
01:08:31,196 --> 01:08:33,907
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,974
Okay, that's $74.50.

758
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:27,562
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,273
There's 80.

760
01:10:30,773 --> 01:10:33,526
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:10:35,904 --> 01:10:39,282
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:10:39,532 --> 01:10:41,075
Just let the meter run.

763
01:10:41,326 --> 01:10:44,704
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

764
01:10:44,829 --> 01:10:47,499
-Okay?
-How long you gonna be?

765
01:10:47,749 --> 01:10:51,127
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 1 0 minutes.

766
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:54,255
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,525
Good evening, sir.

768
01:11:14,484 --> 01:11:15,777
Good evening.

769
01:11:16,444 --> 01:11:17,821
Can we be of any help?

770
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:21,407
I suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:23,201
If you'd like, sir.

772
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,452
Fidelio.

773
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:27,747
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:09,539
Good evening, sir.

775
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,124
Good evening.

776
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,001
Password, sir?

777
01:12:13,793 --> 01:12:14,794
Fidelio.

778
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,838
Thank you, sir.

779
01:18:22,245 --> 01:18:25,123
I'm not sure what you
think you' re doing.

780
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,542
But you don't belong here.

781
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:33,298
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.
