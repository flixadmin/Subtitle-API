and they know
that he'll support extradition,

and await being sent back to the us.

For Manuel noriega,
it was all about the money.

When bush was head of the CIA,
noriega pretended to be a commie hater

90
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:50,619
so the us would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.

91
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,456
When noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs

92
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,002
by siding with communists,
he switched teams.

93
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,172
So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "old pineapple face."

But, that was later.

For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset

his vest and he was dead within minutes.

155
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,149
For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...

156
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,736
Extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.

157
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:23,201
To mourn galan's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...

158
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,332
And in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,

159
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,919
a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.

- Home?

And you know why, fabio.

172

Probably because I've listened

So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

You remember when were cadets,

to lead the country's most important unit.

Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

If there is going to be a war,
I need the right tools.

All right.

it meant they could be trusted

It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.
