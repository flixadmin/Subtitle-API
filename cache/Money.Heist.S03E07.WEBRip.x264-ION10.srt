1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,630
- Good morning, daddy.
- Good morning, queen.

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,995
- Wanna fuck?
- Yes. You do too. Come look at this.

3
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,288
Look out there.

4
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,253
They're Brazilians. We haven't seen
a Brazilian boat in a long time.

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,083
The last ones that came were
Puerto Ricans or Guyanese people.

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,496
No idea.

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,293
They look friendly.

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,206
The CIA, FBI,

9
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,041
and Interpol also have agents
that look friendly.

10
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,075
Come on, man. They're tourists.
You can see it in their faces.

11
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,288
My love.

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,331
We need to socialize.

13
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,578
I'm serious.
Couples need a social life.

14
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,416
They go to parties, they go
to the movies, they dine out.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,290
They don't hang out with Kuna Indians
or play beach tennis every day.

16
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,375
- No.
- No, what?

17
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,288
No.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,130
- Please, come on.
- No. No way.

19
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,828
Tokyo, it's a safety measure.

20
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,998
Hey!

21
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,581
Hey!

22
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,706
Hello, my friends!

23
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:55,456
Rio! Rio! Rio!

24
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,001
Rio! Rio! Rio!

25
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,253
Rio! Rio! Rio!

26
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,503
Rio! Rio! Rio!

27
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,793
Rio! Rio! Rio!

28
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,501
Aníbal Cortés is walking

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,213
towards the Bank of Spain.

30
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:37,131
The Spanish police are handing over one
of the most wanted fugitives in the world.

31
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,998
It's been 44 hours
since the beginning of the robbery

32
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,883
and the police yield,
handing over Cortés.

33
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,538
He's the presumably tortured man.

34
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,375
The Professor's gang
is together again.

35
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,963
Rio is at the bank's door.

36
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,375
It's your turn.

37
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,246
Doors.

38
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,876
Helsinki...

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,710
- Green light.
- Move forward!

40
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,378
HOSTAGE EXCHANGE
AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

41
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,291
You're so handsome!

42
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,541
So handsome,
with a tie and all!

43
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,075
It's the only nice thing
the police did for me.

44
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,496
I can imagine.

45
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,326
You're so beautiful
in the red jumper.

46
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,576
How are you?

47
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,921
- Better.
- Yes.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,580
What the fuck are you doing
in the Bank of Spain?

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,711
We came to get you.

50
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,963
Everything is over.
You're going back home, friends!

51
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,711
All of Spain is with you!

52
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,828
Brave! You're so brave!

53
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,710
Don't worry.
You're with me now.

54
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,171
Let's see what Suárez can tell us now.
There he is.

55
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,540
Suárez, easy!

56
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,746
- I want to go back in!
- Calm down.

57
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,883
Give me more men! Explosives!
We were so close! I'm going to kill them!

58
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,668
- Calm down, please!
- Tamayo!

59
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,711
What's that idiot doing?

60
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,961
It's Arturo Román.
The Royal Mint's former director.

61
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,331
Close the doors!

62
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,286
That fucker!

63
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,383
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.

64
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,288
I'm Arturo Román.

65
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,995
Arturito?

66
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,665
A big applause! Come on!

67
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,578
You're Arturo Román, aren't you?

68
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,245
Of course.

69
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,293
I read your book.

70
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,128
You're fucking crazy!

71
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,541
You could be out there,
living the good life,

72
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,956
but you're here,
in the fucking lion's den.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,290
Do you know what a ruckus
you've raised out there?

74
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,875
Give Helsi a big hug!

75
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,918
You may be a war nutjob,
Helsinki,

76
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,078
but you're a sweetheart!

77
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,578
- Hi!
- Hi!

78
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,206
What should I call you?
Mónica?

79
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
No, Stockholm.

80
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,378
Okay. Brother!

81
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,125
What did you smoke
to come back here?

82
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,418
The life of a millionaire
is very boring.

83
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,540
Thanks, man.

84
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,291
That you're here,

85
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,333
after everything you've lost,
means a lot to me.

86
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,165
Little one!

87
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,788
- Little one! Let me give you a kiss.
- How are you, beautiful?

88
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,246
I couldn't be happier
even if I had given birth to you.

89
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
You're all fucking great.

90
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,580
Yes, we're great, but the one who pushed
us forward was your ugly girlfriend.

91
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,076
- If it wasn't for her...
- Stop that.

92
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,286
You'll have to excuse me,
but it's my turn.

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,210
I will be back shortly.

94
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,170
How are you doing?

95
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,503
Positive for halothane.

96
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,751
But there is no trace
of any other substances. We're fine.

97
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,333
I'm glad. They won a battle, not the war,
so cheer up, for fuck's sake!

98
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,043
Everyone, hear me!

99
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,125
This operation never happened.

100
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,998
- Understood?
- Really?

101
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,131
Not even a Burkina Faso commando
would do what we have done.

102
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,166
Show a little bit of respect.

103
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,246
This isn't going to escalate.

104
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,923
There are no victims,
we've gotten 40 hostages out,

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,710
so let's think about it positively
and let's move forward. Please.

106
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,831
Yes, yes, I'm positive. Look.
Very positive.

107
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,786
The problem is we never
learn the lesson.

108
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,075
That guy is like Einstein, and our four
GEOs broke into the Bank through a toilet.

109
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,286
We did what was necessary.

110
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,785
What did the Navy Seals do
during the search for Bin Laden's?

111
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,955
What did the Russians do
in the Dubrovka Theater?

112
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,291
Exactly what the handbook says.

113
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,543
How long did it take for us
to make this decision?

114
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,915
Twenty minutes?

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Because that guy had years
to decide how to respond.

116
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,633
Every move we make,
he knows how to counteract it.

117
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,038
These operations are always risky.
Always.

118
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,670
Unless you want to enlighten us
with a riskless proposition.

119
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,421
Not one,

120
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,076
at least three.

121
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,578
Antoñanzas, give me a donut.

122
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,288
Mónica.

123
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,418
- You look beautiful.
- I'm Stockholm.

124
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,580
Stand here.

125
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,171
Lift your shirt.

126
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,131
Raise your arms.

127
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,535
Why did you come, Arturo?
They could've shot you.

128
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,495
I don't care.

129
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,125
I stopped caring about
my life when...

130
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,826
when I lost everything.

131
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,503
Laura left me and
took the kids with her.

132
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,828
I live in an apartment that has
a kitchen in a closet.

133
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,245
I eat canned tuna.

134
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,500
And the boxes from the move
are still in the hall, but...

135
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,630
Well, I'm getting over it.

136
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,750
Little by little, Arturo.

137
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,995
Listen. I know I was horrible
to you and my wife.

138
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,166
I admit it.

139
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,291
I think about Laura constantly,
but...

140
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,125
Not as I much
as I think about you.

141
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,918
I always think about you.

142
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,791
About you and about our son.

143
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,581
Because he's a boy, isn't he?

144
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,166
Yes, he's a boy.
Put the jumper on.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,460
I know I've lost you, Mónica.

146
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,831
But I don't want to lose my son.

147
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,706
You lost him the moment you said
you weren't his father.

148
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,921
Put the jumper on, please!

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,460
But what did you expect?

150
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,378
Do you know how hard it is
for a married man with three kids to hear.

151
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,745
Look at the test.
My son is yours. I was scared!

152
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,791
Yes, I was scared shitless.

153
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,128
Who doesn't get scared
with something like that?

154
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,923
But it was only three minutes.

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,040
Three minutes. The time it took
for those terrorists to come

156
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,825
and start shooting at everyone.

157
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm asking you, please,
don't judge me on those three minutes.

158
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,496
I know I don't have any right
to appear out of thin air

159
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,333
and ask you to let me be
the father of my son.

160
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:09,963
I know.

161
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,876
But I want to see him,
that's all.

162
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,705
I don't know.
To touch him and know how he is.

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,540
And I swear I don't care where he is.
I can go to Brazil,

164
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,035
Romania, Burma, Thailand...
wherever.

165
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,415
He's my son
and I want to meet him.

166
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,631
Please.

167
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:39,041
You may have the right to meet him,
but I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

168
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,206
I will try, okay?

169
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,790
Thank you.

170
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,753
Thank you.

171
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,826
Some things never change.

172
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,665
What?

173
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,881
Look at what you do to me.

174
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,288
- Really, Arturo?
- Look how hard you make me.

175
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,495
This is the effect you have on me.

176
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,503
Remember when we did it on my desk?
You can't have changed that much.

177
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,583
Touch me again and you're dead.

178
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,495
You disgust me, Arturo!

179
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,576
You disgust me.

180
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,331
Disgust? I disgust you?

181
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,035
Shoot!

182
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,996
Shoot me here, because if you don't,
this is the only face your son will see.

183
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,173
You and Denver will go to jail
for a long time.

184
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,880
Arturito Junior will never know
who his mother was.

185
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,628
But he's going to call me Dad!
Me!

186
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,168
His legitimate father!
That's why I came, do you get it?

187
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,036
My son's name is Cincinnati.

188
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,245
And you won't see him
in your fucking life!

189
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,668
Helsinki, can you finish here?

190
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,125
Arturito.

191
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,325
Calm down.

192
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,920
You know,
a man takes care of a man.

193
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,536
Come on.
Take your clothes off.

194
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,456
This was the happiest moment
of the robbery.

195
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,535
It may even be
the happiest moment of my life.

196
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,245
But happiness is a lightning bolt.

197
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,711
An exhalation, and then,

198
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,378
you fall.

199
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,165
When you've touched the sky,
the fall is colossal.

200
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,501
We were all plunging
into an abyss,

201
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,713
even the Professor.

202
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,001
First thing, we're making
the same mistake we did

203
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,043
in the previous robbery,
which is trying to catch the Professor.

204
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,825
He's a professional deceiver.
We have to change strategies.

205
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,326
We need to focus on
what we know is inside there.

206
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,630
The gold.

207
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,748
If we figure out how
they plan to get it out,

208
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,253
then they will only be able
to negotiate their surrender.

209
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,383
And to do that,
we will interrogate every hostage!

210
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,920
Not even God gets to go home.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,710
I want to know if they're working.

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,630
How are they working?
For how long?

213
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,998
When? And especially...

214
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,418
Who are these two?

215
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,670
Because the new members are

216
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,790
the key to the plan.

217
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,456
And most importantly,
the reward.

218
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,830
Because they are giving out bills.
We're the state, don't we offer anything?

219
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,786
I want the biggest reward
in the history of the Western world.

220
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,583
Tamayo, what's the cost of a tip
that'd solve this?

221
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,996
I don't know.
Three million euros?

222
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,248
Is there a better offer?

223
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,333
- Three million and half.
- The bidding is open!

224
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,955
Martínez.

225
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
- Four million?
- Four million?

226
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,130
- Five million!
- Fuck, yes! Antoñanzas?

227
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,038
Six million.

228
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,875
Suárez, can you offer more?

229
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Six million going once,
going twice...

230
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Eight!

231
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,538
Eight.
They will eat our pussies.

232
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,876
If we round that amount up,
we're talking about ten million euros.

233
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,631
And that amount of money

234
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,958
would convince any Spaniard
to sell their mother.

235
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,875
Ángel?
Tell me some good news.

236
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,328
- We have something. They were seen.
- Yes!

237
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,076
A local Civil Guard sounded
a warning bell.

238
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,956
We've narrowed down the area
as much as possible.

239
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,831
The radio signal indicated
they were moving. They're around here.

240
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,956
- Where are you?
- Aracena, Huelva.

241
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,631
In a warehouse or something.

242
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,291
There's a van.
They've been here, Colonel.

243
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,825
It looks like
they abandoned it in a rush.

244
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,875
Do you think it could be a trap?

245
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,998
No, I don't think so.

246
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:15,826
I'm going inside.

247
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,916
There's nobody here.
Wait, wait.

248
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,036
Fuck.

249
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,541
Fuck, Colonel. This is like
a telecommunications headquarters.

250
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,035
There are screens
and radio devices everywhere.

251
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,330
I need the forensic team
and a UIT unit.

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,960
They had an accident yesterday
and some farmers helped them.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,460
They've confirmed their identity,
Colonel.

254
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,081
Good, Ángel. You can count on the army,
the police, and fucking everyone.

255
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,286
The hunt begins.

256
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,208
I have you, asshole.
I have you.

257
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,131
Colonel.

258
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,916
Give me a helicopter.
I will lead this hunt.

259
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,580
Let's do it.

260
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,923
Inspector,
they're talking to the Professor.

261
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,633
Rio, I need you to answer me
as precisely as you can.

262
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,960
Where were you held hostage?

263
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,285
In a cell.

264
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,035
A very small one.

265
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,880
As small as a coffin.
I couldn't even sit.

266
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,543
I was always on my feet.

267
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,538
- How many days?
- I don't know.

268
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,921
I lost count after four
or five days.

269
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,461
There was no natural light there.

270
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,211
Rio, can you keep answering?

271
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,038
Yes.

272
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,576
What did they give you to eat?

273
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,956
Some kind of lumpy paste.

274
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,825
Likely made with flour.
And coffee.

275
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,670
A lot of coffee.

276
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,420
Thirty, forty, fifty coffees a day.

277
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,285
I was all hyper.

278
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,418
Sleep deprivation.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,170
Do you think the coffee had
any other substance?

280
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Maybe.

281
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,670
It tasted horrible.

282
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,375
But I was drugged up.

283
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,075
While interrogating me,
they forced me to inhale some gas.

284
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,746
I don't know what the fuck it was.

285
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,376
But then at least,
I could get out of the cell.

286
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,075
And sometimes I could even sit.

287
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,750
Did they allow you
to get out of the cell...

288
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,325
- to do anything else?
- Not even to shit.

289
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,378
They left me there

290
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,251
for hours after I'd pissed
and shit in my pants.

291
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,751
Days.

292
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,325
I don't know.

293
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,126
Did they allow you
to wash yourself?

294
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,745
The closest thing was
when they hosed me down.

295
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,038
How was that, Rio?

296
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,496
First, they hang you naked
from chains.

297
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,456
Then, they use a pressure
hose on you.

298
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,380
If you want this to be over,

299
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,575
just tell us
where the Professor is.

300
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,290
That's what Alicia said constantly.

301
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,328
I swear to you, Professor...

302
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,825
that If I'd known
where you were...

303
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,995
I would've talked.

304
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,830
Anyone would have, Rio.

305
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,535
Anyone would have.

306
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,540
You were scared for your life,
weren't you?

307
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,920
I knew we weren't in Spain.

308
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,875
When the wind's direction changed,

309
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,165
I could hear the call to prayer
from a mosque.

310
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,960
I was completely sure...

311
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,293
that they were going to shoot me
and bury me in the desert.

312
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,460
Every day.

313
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,673
I woke up wondering
if that day was my last day.

314
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,378
All that is over, Rio.

315
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:35,168
Listen. I need you to tell me exactly what
happened when they took you out of there.

316
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,918
They put me on a plane.

317
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,826
And when we landed,
they put me in a car.

318
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,580
And they took me to
a military hospital.

319
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,128
And how did you sleep there?

320
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,078
I have never slept
so well in my life.

321
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,245
They gave me
a shot of something amazing.

322
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,375
And I didn't open my eyes
until this morning.

323
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,378
Alicia woke me up.

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
Well, what?

325
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,541
Where is my red jumper?

326
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
If they hand Rio over to us,
they will probably implant a mic on him.

327
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,791
So if we suspect anything, the key words
will be quick vacation.

328
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,956
Rest a little bit more.

329
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,001
Take a hot bath.

330
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,670
You deserve a quick vacation.

331
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,170
A GPS beacon in a tooth implant.

332
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,460
A mic hidden in the fat tissue,
in the skull, anywhere.

333
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,245
It doesn't matter the cavity,

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,670
we will teach you
how to extract it.

335
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,171
Any volunteers?

336
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,126
Not me. I can't.

337
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,378
Dopey,
you're scared of the scalpel.

338
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,918
No. I have principles.

339
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,535
I'm against animal cruelty.

340
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,463
But you're a soldier. You kill people.
What's the problem? I don't get it.

341
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,081
People are one thing,
animals are another.

342
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,378
I love animals.

343
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,788
The animal activist killer.

344
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,583
Can I believe in whatever I want
or are you going to tell me?

345
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,746
About loving animals?

346
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,041
- Yes.
- Well, yes.

347
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm going to tell you.

348
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,583
If you really love this pig,
slit it open and take the chip out.

349
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,416
And with all your love,
you eat it.

350
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,963
I won't open a pig up.

351
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,826
- I will do the same thing with a doll.
- No, Marseille.

352
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,206
A doll won't work.
We have to open real tissue.

353
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,331
This is the closest thing
there is to a human.

354
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,461
I was in a war.

355
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,131
With a dog at my side.

356
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,915
He was always with me.

357
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,878
People ran away.
The dog stayed with me.

358
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,293
Since then,
I promised myself...

359
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,211
- I won't open the pig up.
- Open the fucking pig! You're a hitman.

360
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,038
Stay away from me!

361
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:18,961
Push me again and I will slit
your tissue open from top to bottom.

362
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,581
Marseille.

363
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,666
The scalpel.

364
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,075
- You both, out of the room.
- Me?

365
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,745
It was his fault.
He doesn't want to slit the pig open.

366
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,673
Get out.

367
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,420
- If I go out, I will beat...
- Now!

368
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,881
Very well.

369
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,788
- The fucking pig.
- These guys...

370
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,541
Let's continue. I don't care

371
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,455
who does it, but we have 15 minutes
to locate the chip and start the surgery.

372
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,418
Tokyo, until we do surgery on Rio,
you all need to lead a normal life.

373
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,825
Lead a normal life
while robbing the Bank of Spain?

374
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,206
They can't suspect we know.

375
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:57,171
You have to talk to Rio about whatever
you need to talk about, unaffectedly.

376
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,170
Talk about how much you have missed
each other and do what feels natural.

377
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,708
Are you suggesting
I should sleep with him?

378
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,535
Because what Rio needs is a hug.

379
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,581
Not a good fuck.

380
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,130
The police know you're a couple
and you haven't seen each other in months.

381
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,496
It's crucial
they think they have access

382
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,583
to your privacy,
so they won't suspect anything.

383
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:23,921
Tokyo.

384
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,328
Tokyo.

385
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,496
They will do
what they have to do.

386
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:02,376
Really?
Was that really necessary?

387
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,918
They held that poor boy for two months
without any sleep in a hole,

388
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,671
shitting and pissing on himself.

389
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:11,001
He thought he was on death row
and now you use him like this?

390
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,463
It's the perfect time to get
a fundamental advantage, Raquel.

391
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,171
Fundamental in this whole war!

392
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,540
To control the mics and beacons
they may have implanted in him.

393
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,745
If they need to fuck, even if they aren't
in the mood for it, they must.

394
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,043
You didn't even realize
Tokyo didn't answer.

395
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,915
You're complaining more
than she is.

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,380
The problem is that I am here.
Isn't it?

397
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,418
And you would rather do this alone.
Like a lone wolf.

398
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,831
So let's be clear for once.

399
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,416
What's happening?

400
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
Sergio, look at me.
What's happening?

401
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,211
- What's up?
- I feel like I am betraying the gang.

402
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,463
What?

403
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,875
I'm disrespecting...

404
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:57,923
the robbery.

405
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,293
My brother could mix
a relationship with all this, I can't.

406
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,415
I find it impossible. I can't, Raquel.
I'm a chess player.

407
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,250
Bobby Fischer would've never faced Spassky
with his girlfriend at his side.

408
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,920
I am nobody's girlfriend.

409
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,380
I'm here because I know the police
a lot better than you

410
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,628
and a lot better
than anybody in this gang.

411
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,578
You know about protocols
and negotiations, just like I do.

412
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,625
I beat you at this game, Raquel.

413
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,830
You beat me at this game?

414
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,578
I must be stupid.

415
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,916
I thought we were in love.

416
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,668
Look. My mother and my daughter
are in the Philippines.

417
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,670
The police are looking for them.

418
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,500
I didn't ask you to come.

419
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,581
This is just revenge, isn't it?

420
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,625
Since the Philippines.

421
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,166
Since those nights you woke up
dreaming about your brother.

422
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:19,706
And Rio is just the perfect excuse
to avenge Berlin. Isn't it?

423
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,463
But do you know what?

424
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,786
You've already fucked up my life.

425
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,078
DON'T SAY ANYTHING

426
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,996
THEY'VE IMPLANTED YOU
WITH A MIC

427
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,461
FOLLOW MY LEAD

428
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,125
What color do you think
my underwear is?

429
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,625
Burgundy.

430
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,538
Black.

431
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,375
And you don't always wear them.

432
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,538
What?

433
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,126
Bingo.

434
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,581
Antoñanzas,
is something going on?

435
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,173
No, sir.

436
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,793
WE'RE GOING TO DO SURGERY ON YOU

437
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:17,076
Rio and I were always
honest while fucking.

438
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,290
But you don't always want
to hear the truth.

439
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,671
Tokyo...

440
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,125
I can't be with you.

441
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,630
I thought a lot about it...

442
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,126
and I realized
I've always followed you

443
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,583
like a lapdog.

444
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,875
In that cell,
I learned that I'm strong.

445
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,995
I was afraid before.

446
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,631
I was afraid of a life without you.

447
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,750
On the island,
after three days...

448
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,833
I was out of my mind.
It's a shitty feeling.

449
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,083
I don't want to be
like that again.

450
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,376
Rio.

451
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,133
Tokyo, you need this.

452
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,880
- No.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

453
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,038
I really am, but I don't want to live
on your roller coaster.

454
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,628
That's how my fall started.

455
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,131
Suddenly, I felt like an oil tanker

456
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,538
that reaches the end of the world
and plunges into the abyss.

457
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,285
And while you fall,

458
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,461
you can only look up

459
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,496
and see how what you loved the most
becomes smaller and smaller.

460
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,706
If I had known

461
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,791
that was going to be
our last fuck,

462
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,825
I wouldn't have allowed it
to reach its end.

463
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,078
I haven't loved anyone
like I've loved you.

464
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,790
And that's not much,
I'm 22 years old.

465
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,708
But it will still be true
when I'm 70.

466
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,745
Rio, don't leave me, please.

467
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,245
Please, don't leave me.

468
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,381
Do you hear me?
Don't leave me.

469
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,631
Don't leave me.

470
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,285
You will move on to
someone better than me.

471
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,495
You're very hot.

472
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,918
- And you're rich.
- No.

473
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,710
And in some years,
we will meet again.

474
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:20,671
And I will be with two or three kids
and grocery bags.

475
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,166
And you will be...

476
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,828
in a stunning convertible.

477
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,126
With a hot black guy,
a Brazilian. Yeah.

478
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,168
And we will drink wine
and laugh about this.

479
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,380
I want to go back to
the island with you.

480
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,668
Please, no.

481
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,496
Colonel,
a drone has located the Professor.

482
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,955
- Does it have a signal?
- Yes.

483
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,171
Put it on the screen.

484
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,038
Colonel Tamayo speaking. Do you copy?
Get closer.

485
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,325
EMERGENCY

486
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,078
Yes. Get closer.

487
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,706
Get closer. Closer!

488
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,251
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

489
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,625
No, no.

490
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,915
Shit. Go up, fuck, go up!
I want to see what exit he takes.

491
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,670
Locate the end of that road.

492
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,630
I have to talk to you about
the escape protocol.

493
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,958
Take those stupid pajamas off.

494
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,333
- Yes. I think the protocol can wait.
- No, tell me about it.

495
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,825
Take it as...

496
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:05,878
some kind of job training
under pressure.

497
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,076
Very well.

498
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,628
Point one.

499
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,538
Dispersion.

500
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,541
If we're located,

501
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,625
we'll have twice
the opportunities

502
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,628
if we separate,
and we have to do that...

503
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,330
very fast.

504
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,673
Raquel.

505
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,923
Be careful.

506
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,880
If they catch you,
I'll kill you.

507
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,131
A very good point one.

508
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,750
And point two.

509
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,416
Point two?

510
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,955
I am not hearing point two,
Professor.

511
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,540
Point two.
In the emergency bags,

512
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,625
we have to bring money,

513
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,035
a camouflage net,

514
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,328
a thermal blanket.

515
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,671
- A gun.
- A gun.

516
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,750
And water to survive
at least 72...

517
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,920
Seventy-two hours.

518
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,538
What's the name of point two?

519
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,125
You give everything a name.

520
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,040
Epicenter.

521
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,418
In everyone's mind,

522
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:03,326
there's a fixed idea,
which is the fugitive runs away.

523
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,543
But we won't run away.

524
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,380
We'll stay there.

525
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,035
We will stay still,
whatever happens,

526
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,580
within a 500-meter radius

527
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,876
of wherever we are detected.

528
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:20,036
- The epicenter.
- The epicenter. Very good.

529
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,205
We will be a few meters away from them,
but they won't see us,

530
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:27,791
provided that we hide during
the first four minutes.

531
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,535
How are we going to hide?

532
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,705
Seven or eight meters
off the ground.

533
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,961
At the top of a tree.

534
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,713
We will use the same hiding
technique as snipers.

535
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,671
A perfect camouflage.

536
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,790
The class is over.

537
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,420
Raquel, you should be
in position already.

538
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,130
I know, but I have a problem.

539
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,788
What's wrong?

540
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,251
There are soldiers.
I won't have enough time.

541
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,833
No. Stick to the plan.

542
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,170
Raquel!

543
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,288
There they are!

544
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,285
Get closer.

545
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,075
Shit!

546
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,171
I want the forensic team there!

547
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,080
We've caught them in their undies,
gentlemen.

548
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,036
I'm sure that ambulance
is full of evidence. Come on!

549
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,670
Raquel, I'm two kilometers
to the west of the epicenter.

550
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,250
There are military officers everywhere.
Did you get to the top of the tree?

551
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,043
- No, I had to improvise.
- What?

552
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,625
There's a farm 400 meters south
from your position.

553
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,538
No. That's the first place
they'll check.

554
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,665
- I don't have any other option.
- Raquel?

555
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,995
The Ministry of the Interior
has just announced

556
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,963
the biggest reward in history.

557
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:15,381
Ten million euros for any information
that helps capture the Professor

558
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,128
or dismantle the robbery.

559
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,626
Public support is one
of the police's biggest worries...

560
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,080
Every hostage says...

561
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,495
this guy took some hostages
to help him.

562
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,245
He said they were going to work in
more than 65 degrees.

563
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,415
They're melting the gold.

564
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,253
Melting the gold? How?

565
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,248
Fuck, Sierra. What have they set up
in there? A fucking forge?

566
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:45,416
An industrial oven is smaller
than a dishwasher.

567
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,420
They went into the Bank
with army trucks.

568
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,631
Fuck me!

569
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,710
They're melting the national
reserve! Why?

570
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,791
To get it out,
it makes the extraction easier.

571
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,166
They can shape it any way they want.

572
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,710
They can pass it through a drain

573
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,751
or get it out in their zeppelins
in the form of gold grains.

574
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,463
I don't know.

575
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,668
Let's go forward with your plan.
We're going after the gold.

576
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,833
They won't even get a grain out!

577
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,290
Gentlemen,
they must be around here.

578
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,173
Make the dogs smell the samples
we found in the van.

579
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,583
Look around the whole forest!
Leave no stone unturned!

580
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,286
Every building you find,
search it thoroughly! Okay?

581
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,625
Let's go!
