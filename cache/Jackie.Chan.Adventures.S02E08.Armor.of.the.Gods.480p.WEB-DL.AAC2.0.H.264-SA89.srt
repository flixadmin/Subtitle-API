1
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,915
(Coughs)

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,456
Oh...The armor
of the 8 immortals.

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,900
Hmm, doesn't seem
very special.

4
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,573
Ehh...Heh. Housekeeping?

5
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,849
Heh. Termites.

6
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,236
Daah!

7
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,210
Unh. Ohh.

8
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,480
Aaaahhhh!

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,819
Whoa!

10
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,425
Uh, pass the bok choy,
please?

11
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,259
Jackie!
Aah!

12
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,994
You are too loud!

13
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,996
Uncle, you are the one
who's yelling.

14
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,098
(Gasps)

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,901
You dishonor the only
known existing relic

16
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,502
of the 8 immortals.

17
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,437
You caused me to drop it.

18
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,641
(Gasps) You dishonor
your uncle.

19
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,576
Hey, Jackie.

20
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,378
Jade, what are you doing up?

21
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,313
"Old yeller"
is keeping us all up.

22
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,382
He hasn't slept in days.

23
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,384
Tohru, where is my tea?

24
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,753
(Snores) What?

25
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,422
(Continues snoring)

26
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,357
Aiyaaa!

27
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,259
Uncle, why won't
you sleep?

28
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,196
Because I have
demons on the brain.

29
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,164
I lay down,
and all I hear is...

30
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,632
Chi spell, chi spell,
chi spell.

31
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,234
Have you tried
counting sheep?

32
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,770
Demons always eat them.

33
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,173
Ah, well, thank you
for watching Jade.

34
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,076
Where are you going?

35
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,145
We must study
the immortals' armor

36
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,380
and discover
what magic it holds.

37
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,417
Now? It is 3 A.M., uncle.

38
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,018
You should really
try to sleep.

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,119
(Cell phone rings)

40
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,489
How can I sleep
with all this noise?

41
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,891
Yes?

42
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,459
Jackie, we've spotted
the dark hand.

43
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,527
I'm on my way.

44
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,895
Care to know
where you're going?

45
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,497
I don't care.
Anywhere but here.

46
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,032
Ok.

47
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,638
Whew. Uncle, I'm off to Spain.

48
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,206
I will call you
for the chi spell

49
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,509
once I find out which demon
we're dealing with.

50
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,979
Take the armor.
It could be of some use.

51
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,515
But you have to discover
what magic it holds.

52
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,253
How can I do that
if you take it with you?

53
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,255
(Stammers)

54
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,326
Festive.

55
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,663
I'm telling you,
Pamplona's famous
for somethin'.

56
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,298
It must be the paella.

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,035
Oh, the thing they
whack with a stick
till candy comes out?

58
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,437
That would be
a piata, ratso.

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,607
This is Spain, not Mexico.

60
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,877
(Grunts)

61
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,820
I know this place
is famous for somethin'.

62
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,491
Shendu: Soon
it will be famous for
the return of dai gui,

63
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,426
the earth demon.

64
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,730
No, it won't.

65
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,633
(TV plays quietly)

66
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,070
Uncle: Jade, TV is too loud.

67
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,772
(Turns down volume)

68
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,575
Still too loud!

69
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,843
Grrr...

70
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:16,715
I can hear the electricity
in the wires. Unplug!

71
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,152
(Sighs) I wish there was
a way to unplug <i> uncle.</i>

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,593
There's gotta be a chill-pill
potion in here.

73
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,841
Call uncle a lumberjack,
'cause he's gonna be
sawing logs.

74
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,147
Jade, the books
are laughing at me.

75
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,816
¶ Not for long ¶

76
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,184
tea, dear uncle?

77
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,885
Yes.

78
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,326
Blaaaah! Jade, this tea

79
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,663
tastes like it was brewed
with beard of goat.

80
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,265
One more thing--
it is bitter.

81
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,768
One more thing--
it is cold!

82
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,237
One more thing--

83
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,441
(yawning)

84
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,510
(Snores)

85
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,178
Hotcha.

86
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,050
Hmm...

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,092
-Hak foo?
-Here I am.

88
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,629
Chan!

89
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,368
Spanish mackerel technique!

90
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,004
Unh! Ohh!

91
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,211
Shendu: Stop him,
you fop.

92
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,213
I'm trying, you old dragon.

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,284
Aah!

94
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,887
Shendu: Without touching
the good magic.

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,295
(Both grunt)

96
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,469
Valmont: I've got it.

97
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,572
Shendu: No, you fool.
It's good magic.

98
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,311
Shendu: Get it.

99
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,613
Gorilla grip.
Ohh.

100
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,681
(People yelling)

101
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,349
Do you hear that, chan?

102
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,585
The earth demon
has been released.

103
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,654
How can that be
the earth demon,
you baboon?

104
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,557
The portal remains
to be opened.

105
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,992
(Yelling)

106
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,536
That's what Pamplona's
famous for--

107
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,938
(rumbling)

108
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,577
The running of the bulls.

109
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,720
Yaaahhh!

110
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,855
Shendu: The box!

111
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,656
Huh? What? Oh.

112
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,534
Yaaahh!

113
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,570
Uhh! Uhh! Ohh!

114
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,888
Hoo-aaahhhh!

115
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,494
Mouse runs through maze!

116
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,969
(Grunting)

117
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,974
<i>Hasta luego!</i>

118
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,980
Wha? Huh?

119
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,718
Mouse takes cheese.

120
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,760
(Snoring)

121
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,629
So...How deep
is the sleep?

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,067
(Clang)

123
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,938
Yea deep.
(Telephone rings)

124
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,841
- Uncle's rare finds.
May I help you?
- Jade?

125
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,910
Jackie! How's Spain?
You get a chance

126
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,612
to wear that smelly
old armor yet?

127
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,213
No, but I did
get a chance

128
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,049
to be bowlegged
and saddle-sore.

129
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,784
Let me speak
with uncle.

130
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,619
(Snoring)

131
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,054
Uncle's
taking a nap.

132
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,323
Oh, that's wonderful!

133
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,224
(Stammering)
No. Wake him up.

134
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,027
I need uncle
here in Spain
immediately.

135
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,829
Errrr...He...Uh...

136
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,898
Just went into the bathroom.
You know how he gets

137
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,800
when you interrupt
his private time.

138
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,068
I'll give him
the message.

139
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,103
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

140
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,439
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Earth demon?!

141
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,441
Uh, mm-hmm.
Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah.

142
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,509
Chi spell. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, ok.
I'll tell him.

143
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,045
And how long

144
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,448
does the deep sleep
spell last?

145
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,886
Wake up! Wake up,
wake up, wake up!

146
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:22,954
(Sighs)

147
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,155
(Snores)

148
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,925
We should have forced
uncle to count sheep.

149
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,161
Sheep! Tohru,
you are da bomb!

150
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,732
I'll use
the sheep talisman

151
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,267
to astro-project myself
into rip Van uncle's
dreams.

152
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,603
Where you will tell him
about the earth demon,

153
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,105
and he will
offer you...

154
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,439
A chi spell.

155
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,213
Incoming!

156
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,457
Whoa. Sheep again.

157
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,894
Jade. How happy
I am to see you!

158
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,529
You are?

159
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,499
You are
my favorite person

160
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,601
in the whole
wide world.

161
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,770
You're not uncle.
What've you done with him?

162
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,071
Heh heh heh!

163
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:16,174
Oh, oh, Jade,
you are such a card.

164
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,776
Heh heh heh.

165
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,177
(Uncle hums cheerfully)

166
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,645
Ha ha ha ha ha!

167
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,747
¶ Hee hee hee
hee-hee hee-hee ¶

168
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,948
it's only a dream.

169
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,384
It's only a dream.

170
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,486
Just give me
the ingredients
to cast a spell

171
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,788
against
the earth demon,
and you can go

172
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,790
back to being
all weird. Ok?

173
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,794
Oh, must I think
about demons?

174
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,861
Happy thoughts.

175
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,596
Only happy thoughts.

176
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,066
Uncle! I need
the chi spell! Now!

177
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,803
O...K...
Little miss cranky.

178
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,205
First you need the symbol
of the immortal

179
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,808
who originally defeated
the earth demon.

180
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,209
And that would be?

181
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,511
A flower!

182
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,612
Second...

183
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,614
(Yawning)

184
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,450
You need
the key ingredient

185
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,552
found
- in every chi spell--

186
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,720
hair of ewe.

187
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,822
Didn't know my hair
was so potent.

188
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,889
And third?

189
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,058
For that,
I must do research.

190
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,794
(Yawns) After a nap.

191
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,862
Uncle!

192
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:11,963
Uncle!

193
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,036
- Grrr!
- Well?

194
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,337
Grab Mr. happypants.

195
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,772
We're flying to Spain.

196
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,474
"Mr. happypants"?

197
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,443
But what if uncle
does not wake in time
to cast the chi spell?

198
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,414
We have a long flight
to catch up
on our <i> research!</i>

199
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,548
Black: Black.

200
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,649
Captain black.

201
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,551
I've been trying
to reach you for hours.

202
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,520
Sorry, Jackie.
Company softball game.

203
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,888
Guess who hit
a home run.

204
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,524
You did? Oh,
congratula--oh. No.

205
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,360
Listen, I need help
from satellite
surveillance.

206
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,529
I have lost
valmont's trail.

207
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,759
Shendu: So good to see you
out and about, dai gui.

208
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,629
Rahrr...

209
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,798
Too many flowers.

210
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Dai gui does not
like "pretty."

211
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,870
My kingdom
must be submerged

212
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,705
into the depths
of the earth.

213
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,775
Do not stand there!

214
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,143
Start digging!

215
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,045
D-d...Digging?

216
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,650
Shendu: We would be
most happy to assist,

217
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,152
burliest of brothers,
but...

218
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,221
We have other portals
to seek,

219
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,056
family to release.

220
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,257
Rahrrr...

221
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,293
Very well, then.

222
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,262
The dirty work
shall be mine alone.

223
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,342
Yaaahh!
Aaahhh!
Aaahhh!

224
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,052
Yaaahhh!
Aaahhh!
Aaahhh!

225
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,422
Hak foo: Antelope
flee raging bull!

226
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,990
Ratso: Land shark!

227
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,660
Hmm?

228
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,795
Bwaahh!

229
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,196
Gahh!

230
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeee-ohhhhh!

231
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,869
Yohh! Oh! Ow! Ow!
Oh, ow!

232
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,036
Gooww!

233
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,219
Rahrrr...

234
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,558
You are either
a very large grub

235
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,693
or this Jackie chan

236
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,296
of whom all demons speak.

237
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,498
Grub. Grub.

238
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,902
Consider yourself buried,
Jackie chan!

239
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,246
Yaaahh!

240
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,048
Nnaaahhhh!

241
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,716
(Panting fearfully)

242
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,431
What do I
have to lose?

243
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,137
If you have powers,

244
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,973
now would be
a good time
to demonstrate!

245
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,275
Look what <i> I</i> found.

246
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,148
Raahhrr!

247
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,384
Grub...Or flatworm?

248
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,487
Hah...Hah hah...
Hah--huh?

249
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,857
Hup!

250
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,994
Didn't feel a thing.

251
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,997
(Snoring)

252
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,899
We got all
the chi ingredients.

253
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,000
We're golden.

254
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,802
Good, because
it does not seem

255
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,271
the sleep spell
will wear off
anytime soon.

256
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,340
About that
little screwup, t...

257
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,409
Maybe Jackie doesn't
need to know about
sleeping beauty here?

258
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,379
But...How can Jackie
<i>not</i> notice?

259
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,451
Earthquake?

260
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,219
Earth <i> demon.</i>

261
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,488
Raahhhrrr!

262
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,559
Raaahhhrrr!

263
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,228
Unhh!

264
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,464
Arrhh! Yarhh!
Rahhrr!

265
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,101
Jackie!

266
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,406
Uncle!

267
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,141
Raahhrr!

268
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,577
Whoops.

269
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,678
Raahhrr!

270
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,080
Uncle!
- You look rested.

271
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,082
Did you bring
the chi spell?

272
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,484
(Snoring)

273
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,553
Yes!

274
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,055
Where is it? Ow!

275
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,357
Uh...Uncle needs
preparation time.

276
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,127
I will keep
dai gui busy.

277
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,237
Uhhhh!

278
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,438
Arrhhh!

279
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,078
I shall shell you
of that armor.

280
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,652
I bet that you
are soft inside...

281
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,220
Like a lichee nut.

282
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,556
Nnn...Uncle! Hurry!

283
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,859
Huh?

284
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,529
(Snoring)

285
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,998
Nnn...Gnhh...Duhh!

286
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,870
Uncle! This is
no time for a nap!

287
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,306
No sweat, Jackie.
We're just about
ready to chi.

288
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,908
<i>You</i> made the chi spell?

289
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,009
Talk later!

290
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,984
And now
for the hair of me.

291
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,388
Jade! The spell!

292
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,589
Hit it, t!

293
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,991
(Chanting like uncle)

294
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,960
(Chanting)

295
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,862
(Repeating)

296
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,799
Ohhh!

297
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,736
(Chuckles
embarrassedly)

298
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,938
Aim still needs work.

299
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,539
No portal has opened.

300
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,174
The chi spell
did not work.

301
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,977
Mmm...But...
I followed
the instructions!

302
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,213
Ohhh...

303
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,986
Dai gui does not
like flowers.

304
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,054
Oh, no!

305
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,255
(Uncle yawning)

306
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,157
(Yawning)

307
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,059
Good morning,
Jade!

308
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,827
Raahhrrr!

309
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,030
Aiyaaaahhh!

310
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,035
Uncle, we have
the ingredients.

311
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,170
What are we
doing wrong?

312
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,372
I see no hair
of ewe.

313
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,674
I keep plucking,
I'm gonna get
a bald spot.

314
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:08,379
No, Jade. Ewe.
A female sheep.

315
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,115
Well, there's
plenty of those...
In your dreams.

316
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,317
Wool?

317
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,191
(Frantic
chanting)

318
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,026
(Joins in
chanting)

319
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,028
(Chanting continues)

320
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,963
(Frantic chanting)

321
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,835
Uhh...Raaahhhh...

322
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,638
Uhhh!

323
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,740
Here comes my favorite part.

324
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,042
Dai gui: Nooooooo...

325
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,678
Ooooooo...

326
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,187
How are you
feeling, uncle?

327
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,222
Very well...
Thank you.

328
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:54,192
Except for
the demon screaming
in my face!

329
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,526
One more thing!

330
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,563
I told you the armor
was good armor!

331
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,031
One more thing!

332
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,467
You should never
question uncle!

333
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,838
You should've made
uncle's tea stronger.

334
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,440
He is still cranky.

335
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,641
I don't think

336
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,943
there's enough tea
in China

337
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,911
to simmer
uncle down.

338
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,147
But I'll take
Mr. sourpuss

339
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,149
over Mr. happypants
any ol' day.

340
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,825
Hey, Jackie.
How many hours a day
do you work out?

341
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,628
That really depends.
If I'm filming
the whole day,

342
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,663
at least an hour a day.

343
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,032
Nothing to shoot
for the next couple
of days,

344
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:38,336
then at least 3 hour
a day.

345
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,705
After you train
so hard...

346
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,040
Ok, I have to watch...

347
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,108
My diet.

348
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,345
Nothing...Important...
Than health.
