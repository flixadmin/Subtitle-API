00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,920
<i>If you're seeing this,
we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,520
<i>I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be,</i>

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>- but find me.</i>
- John, wait!

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
- Masher?
<i>- Has Astra released</i>

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,440
<i>the worst souls from hell onto Earth?</i>

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,040
I'm unkillable!

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,040
- I'm putting an end to this.
- Are you trying to go back to hell?

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,240
I'll return when the sigil
is complete.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,480
Ma'am, we caught him lurking outside.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
It seems you're having
a hard time staying away

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,040
from hell these days, John.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,440
Well, what can I say?
I'm a creature of habit.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,120
You might as well get used to it.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
You'll be living down here
soon enough.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
What do you want?

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,600
Oh, whiskey neat
and a steak well done.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,040
Oh, yeah, and all those souls
you released...

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,640
call them back.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,560
Look, there is enough evil on Earth

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
without you giving the damned
a second chance.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,640
Those damned souls
are making me rich, John.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,040
Any humans corrupted or killed
by them all belong to me.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,680
And after years of being
under the boot of the triumvirate,

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,120
it sure feels good
to grind my heel on someone else.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,800
- Masher?
- Jo-John...

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
Help me.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,400
John's better at getting his friends
into trouble than out of it.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,360
Something you should have known
when you squealed on me.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,040
- You don't have to do this, Astra.
- I like doing this.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,480
No, more. Please.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Astra, look, I came down here
for a friendly chat, all right?

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,440
Now, we don't have to be enemies.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
You're not my enemy, John.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
You're an important step
in my evolution.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
I crawled my way up
from the bottom,

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,080
and I finally have
some real power around here.

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,840
So, if you want to stop me...

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
You'll have to kill me.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,000
But really, what's the point?

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,960
My soul would just end up
back down here anyway.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
John.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,880
What happened down there?

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
I need a drink.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,920
- No, post-mission debrief?
- It's part of his process.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Come on, Gideon,
play the damn message again.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,840
<i>You can mistreat me
all you like, Mr. Heywood,</i>

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,640
<i>but I assure you there are no secret
messages hiding in my memory banks.</i>

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Everything okay, bro?

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,320
Yeah, I was just double-checking
something.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,440
Little help?

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
I think I'm starting to see things.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,840
I know what's going on.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,040
- You do?
- You get into my stash again?

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,120
Dude, no worries.
Sara's gathering the team.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,440
- Come on.
- Thanks.

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,440
And that is the truth of it,
mateys.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
Astra and this whole bloody mess
is on me.

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,000
And she can't be reasoned with.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
So, we need a more permanent solution
to stop her,

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,160
or she could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,040
Surely Astra can change.
She's still human, right?

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,600
I mean, even a Master
of the Dark Arts

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,960
must believe there's still
some good left in her.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Forget it, big man.

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Astra's lust for power,
it zapped the humanity out of her.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
Well, on the bright side,

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,640
at least the Encores
aren't our fault this time.

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,800
Hey, up top.

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Is there any point in sending
these Encores to hell?

71
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,240
It sounds like Astra would
just send them straight back.

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
Correct.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
Well, then, until we find
a more permanent solution,

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,280
we'll house the Encores on the ship.

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,320
We're gonna need a bigger pantry.

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
Hey, Cap,

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
{\an5}normally I'd be all for rolling up
my sleeves and pitching in,

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
{\an5}but I gotta take shore leave
for my pop's birthday.

79
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
And Nate's coming with me.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,320
- I am?
- You are?

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
{\an5}My parents are always
asking questions about my life.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,200
{\an5}He could pretend to be
one of my biz school professors.

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
I still can't believe
that you haven't told your parents

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,000
the truth about what you do.

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
{\an5}You mean that
I'm a time-traveling superhero

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,200
{\an5}who stole the family heirloom?

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,200
{\an5}Okay.
Yeah, stick to business school.

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
We'll be back
before you can say Timequake.

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
Don't jinx it.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}<i>Too late, Captain.
A new Timequake has been detected.</i>

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
{\an5}<i>You are needed on the bridge.</i>

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,200
What are we looking at?

93
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,400
The epicenter of the Timequake
is in Los Angeles, 1947.

94
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
{\an5}It's the Golden Age of Hollywood

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,360
{\an5}and the height
of organized crime in the city.

96
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,760
The real golden age.

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
{\an5}All right, people, we're gonna
need two teams for the...

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,040
{\an5}Sorry, honey.
I think I'm in your spot, aren't I?

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,200
{\an5}Hey, don't sweat it, babe.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,000
As Ava was saying, two teams.
Ray, John, with me.

101
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
{\an5}Mick, Ava, QB from the ship.
Now, let's do it.

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
{\an5}You hear that?

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
{\an5}It's only my second official mission
with the Legends,

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
{\an5}and I'm already being trusted
with the football.

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
{\an5}Really?

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,480
{\an5}QB means staying on the ship
and doing nothing.

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,640
{\an5}Or it could mean providing the team
with vital information.

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,680
{\an5}Gideon, pull up a topographical
survey of the city, please.

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
How you feeling?

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
Great. I just needed
to get off the ship,

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,440
{\an5}- clear my head...
- As god willing.

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
{\an5}- I adore you.
- Happy birthday. My son.

113
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,360
{\an5}Your hair is long.
I can cut it if you want.

114
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,800
{\an5}Give him a break,
he just got here.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
{\an5}Guys,
this is Nathaniel Heywood.

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
{\an5}He's one of my professors.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh, we've never
had a professor over for dinner.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
{\an5}- What do you teach?
- Advanced Macroeconomics.

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
{\an5}Behavioral Economics...

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
- Hey, guys.
- Brace yourself.

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
{\an5}Z here. So I'm at my parents' house
celebrating my dad's birthday.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
After all, family is everything.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,200
{\an5}Speaking of which, it looks like
we have a surprise guest this year.

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,200
My brother, Behrad.

126
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,960
- Say hello, B.
- Hi.

127
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,760
{\an5}Anyways, guys, I gotta go.
Big love to the Z-Nation.

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
{\an5}Insert that clip
at the end of the current file.

129
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
{\an5}We'll start cutting tonight.

130
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,360
{\an5}You two can set up glam
in the bathroom for touch-ups.

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,000
{\an5}Hey, I thought this was supposed
to be a family party.

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,960
{\an5}Says the woman who just invited
her 48 million followers

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
{\an5}- into her house.
- It's 51 million. Try to keep up.

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,320
Zari, darling, isn't it marvelous?

135
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
Your brother brought home one
of his professors from grad school.

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,600
- Zari, Nate. Nate, Zari.
- Hi.

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
It's you.

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,960
I saw the video.

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,960
{\an5}Thanks for subscribing.

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,160
{\an5}You know, it's the fans that really
make all the hard work worth it.

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
What a weirdo.

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
{\an5}- Be polite, Zari.
- He's the one drooling on me.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Your sister is the secret woman
from the hologram message.

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,520
{\an5}- Secret what?
- I thought I was hallucinating,

145
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,840
{\an5}but Gideon was scrubbing
her memory,

146
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,480
{\an5}and there was a secret message
from your sister

147
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,760
{\an5}telling me to find her,
and she's the reason I came back.

148
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,640
Are you having a psychological break?

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,120
{\an5}No! I'm being serious.

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
{\an5}Remember when
we dented history at Heyworld?

151
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
Your sister is the dent.

152
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
The traces of magical energy lead
into this office.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
There's an infernal residue in here.

154
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
Sure is. Residue of a dead guy.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,800
Stand back.

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,040
{\an5}The victim was consumed
by <i>ignis inferni.</i>

157
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
It's hellfire.

158
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,520
Whoever did this to him
was not of this world.

159
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Well, looks like our killer
is the Encore.

160
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
{\an5}Bollocks!

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,760
{\an5}There's the ticket.

162
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,480
- Don't come any closer!
- All right, easy.

163
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,520
You can put the gun down.
We're here to help.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where's Webb?

165
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
He...

166
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,840
We are the "And Moore"
of Webb and Moore.

167
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
We work with Moore. Webb.

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
You must be Moore.

169
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Sure. That's me. Johnny Moore.

170
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,800
Sara is my secretary,
and this fella here...

171
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,280
- Has got a cop face.
- Oh, thank you.

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,400
Sergeant Palmer at your service.
I'm undercover.

173
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,640
Tell Webb to call me when he's back.

174
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,880
He's on holiday. Vacation.

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,440
Which leaves me
handling your case, Miss...

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Hill.

177
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Jeanie Hill.

178
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
I hired your partner
to protect me from my boyfriend.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Oh, well,
you're in good hands, ma'am.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,320
Give me a break, Johnny Law.
Half the PD is in Bugsy's pocket.

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,640
- Bugsy as in...
- Benjamin Siegel.

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
Doesn't like it
when you call him Bugsy.

183
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
But here's the kicker.

184
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,120
He died last week.

185
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,960
And now he's back from the dead.

186
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,800
<i>And he's more dangerous than ever.</i>

187
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,520
<i>He took over a joint
on Sunset Boulevard</i>

188
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,040
<i>called the Blue Iguana.</i>

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,560
<i>Playground of gangsters
and the Hollywood elite.</i>

190
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,520
<i>Whatever vice floats your boat,
that's where you'll find it.</i>

191
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,840
Ladies and gentlemen...

192
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
Welcome to the Blue Iguana.

193
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Now, have fun. I insist.

194
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,560
If you don't,
I just might have to shoot you.

195
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
Mr. Siegel.

196
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
Big smile for the camera, Mr. Siegel.

197
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,240
Just cleaning up
a little bit of crumbs.

198
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Please, Miss Hill, continue.

199
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,760
I was there when Bugsy
was assassinated by a mob hitman.

200
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Saw the whole thing.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,720
But then, the very next day,
lover boy shows up on my doorstep,

202
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,960
takes me to his club
like nothing had happened.

203
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
And that's just the biscuit.
Here comes the gravy.

204
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,040
He's different now.

205
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,120
More ambitious and fearless.

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,440
I want to leave him, but I can't
because I know he'd kill me.

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,160
Look, Miss Hill, we can protect you
from your boyfriend.

208
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,520
But you're gonna need
to get out of town for a few days,

209
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,640
stay in a motel.
Things could get messy.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,320
But I don't have any money.

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
Bugsy takes care of all that.

212
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
How can I ever repay you?

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,000
No, need to worry about that.

214
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
We just want to make sure
you're safe.

215
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,280
Secretary Sara,
can you show Miss Hill the way out?

216
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,920
Well, she took you
for an easy mark, Raymondo.

217
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,880
What?
She was absolutely terrified.

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Sara?

219
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,480
Jury's still out on the missus.

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
But it sounds like we need
to pay a visit to the Blue Iguana.

221
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,360
All right, this is more like it.
Feels good to be back in the field.

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,640
Ava, what's your status?

223
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
- Beer.
- Rory and I are just sidling up

224
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,680
to the bar now.
We're gonna keep an eye on things.

225
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm seeing two zones of egress.
Back door's a gray zone.

226
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
Front door's got about four guys
sitting around it,

227
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
which quite frankly feels
like overkill.

228
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
What do you think, Mick?

229
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
I think you need to relax.

230
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,560
Ray, are you ready to grab Bugsy
when he comes out?

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Ready and walking the beat.

232
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
Gotta say, feeling pretty spiffy
in this uniform.

233
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,480
Bugsy's drawn himself
quite a crowd of ass-kissers.

234
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
Yeah, and judging
by the cheap threads

235
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,120
and conservative haircuts,
I'd say they're politicians.

236
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Well, if it isn't
our damsel in distress.

237
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,280
It's gonna be kind of hard
to protect her from her beau

238
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,840
when she's hanging on his arm.

239
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,720
I knew it.
She's as bent as a nine bob note.

240
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Let's go.

241
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Not so fast, sister.
What happened to getting out of town?

242
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
You think a cab ride could get me
away from what Bugsy's got on me?

243
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,960
You and the rest of town,
by the looks of it.

244
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Look...

245
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,760
Ever since Bugsy came back,
he gets whatever he wants.

246
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
And everyone answers to him.

247
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,400
- Politicians, studio heads...
- Even the cops.

248
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,000
Then tell me, how did he get
so much juice so fast?

249
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,680
By using America's favorite pastime,
of course.

250
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,920
Blackmail.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,120
He's got a secret stash
of compromising photographs

252
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
he uses against all of them.

253
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,800
And what does
that have to do with you?

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,080
Everything.
I'm in those pictures.

255
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,880
Bugsy used me as bait to lure men
and women into his trap.

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
When I first moved here
from Shaker Heights,

257
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,440
I thought I was gonna be famous.

258
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,960
And sure, I became famous,
all right.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Just not the right kind of famous.

260
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,240
I can't leave without those pictures.

261
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,880
Satisfied?

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,680
You know, if Bugsy
likes honeytraps so much,

263
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,240
why don't we give him
a taste of his own medicine?

264
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
I couldn't help but notice you,
and I gotta tell you,

265
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,120
I like the way you walk.

266
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,760
I learned to do it all by myself,
Mr. Siegel.

267
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,240
Oh, please. Benjamin.

268
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,440
- Sara Lance. At your service.
- Lance?

269
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,680
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

270
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,280
Well, I don't know yet.
Just trying it out for size.

271
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,600
You know, even if it fits,

272
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm a little curious
about the price tag.

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,640
Well, if you have to ask,
it's probably too expensive.

274
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,600
I take what I want.

275
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,960
Does that make you a thief,
Mr. Siegel?

276
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,600
I am a lot of things,
Miss Lance.

277
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,120
And I am especially a thief.

278
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,880
Well, then let's stop
all the tiddlywinks

279
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,600
and get straight
to the big reveal, shall we?

280
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,480
Now, I'm a reporter
for a new gossip rag,

281
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,280
and I've got some dirt
on half the city councilmen

282
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,080
and the new archbishop.

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,680
It's in my car.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you say we go out back,

285
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,720
and you can take a peek
what's in my trunk?

286
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,880
I say,

287
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,960
you keep talking like that,

288
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,240
I just might follow you anywhere.

289
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,600
Ray, I'm outside with...

290
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,000
Benjamin. Car's this way.

291
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,120
You know, on second thought,
why don't we ditch the club?

292
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,360
- Let's get out from here.
- How about you and me,

293
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
we go someplace
with a little less company?

294
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,760
Actually, I think we
already have company.

295
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,320
Your eyesight's 20-20, doll.
Those are Mickey Cohen's boys.

296
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,120
But after going through hell,

297
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,720
I ain't afraid of nothing
on this Earth.

298
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,440
You might want to jump out
of the pot.

299
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,120
Water's about to boil.

300
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Drop the gun.
Put your hands in the air.

301
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,400
Stand down, son.
We'll take it from here.

302
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,920
It feels weird to be foiled
by the good guys.

303
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,440
What's the plan B?

304
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,520
Well, it looks like
you're going downtown, Sergeant.

305
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,280
Tomorrow is huge.

306
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,120
We're making a line
of dressy sneakers.

307
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,960
- It's gonna be so major.
- That's nice, dear.

308
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,720
So, Behrad, any girlfriends
we should know about?

309
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,640
No, Ma. There's not really much time
for dating, given all the coursework.

310
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,360
But you need to take your nose
out of your books on occasion,

311
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,000
otherwise you'll never find
a nice Persian girl to marry.

312
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Behrad...

313
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,920
{\an5}The next time you decide
to bring home a stalker,

314
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
{\an5}remind me to up my security.

315
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
By all means.
Add to your entourage.

316
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,680
How much does worshipping you
pay these days?

317
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,800
My team
is my extended family.

318
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
They help me manage a multi-platform,
multi-million-dollar brand,

319
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
and I didn't even have
to go to business school.

320
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
Is that the Air Totem in the...

321
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
Why, yes, it is, Professor.

322
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,560
How do you know
about our family heirloom?

323
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,200
Behrad told me.

324
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
Really? What did he tell you
about the Air Totem?

325
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,200
Just that...

326
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320
I was so broken up
when I found out it was stolen.

327
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,000
We keep the painting up
as a memento.

328
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,400
Even though it's lost, I feel like
it's still here with us today

329
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
in this very room.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,080
- Yeah.
- So, Sara,

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,200
do you want us back at the ship
for a post-mission debrief?

332
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,760
No. Mission ain't over yet.
I need you guys posted at the club.

333
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,120
<i>Keep your eyes peeled
and your ears open.</i>

334
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Great.

335
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
What?

336
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,840
You wouldn't understand.

337
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,840
That you were the boss of
a massive government organization

338
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,560
and now you do diddly-squat?

339
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,800
I take it back, Rory.
You just summed up my life perfectly.

340
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
Can I get a double?

341
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,360
Bugsy is gonna be pretty hard
to catch if he still has that gun.

342
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,160
Well,
we best get our hands on it pronto,

343
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,840
because only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

344
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,720
And that gun, it may be useful
in more ways than one.

345
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,800
Well, good thing
I have my best man on the job.

346
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Jeanie was right.

347
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,160
Bugsy really does have the LAPD
in his pocket.

348
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to get that gun.

349
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,800
Can I take those arrest summaries
off your hands?

350
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm on my way to records.

351
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,240
Sure.
That'd be super helpful. Thanks.

352
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,360
Tough to watch the department
kowtow to a gangster.

353
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,320
That's exactly what I was thinking.

354
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Good cops like you are hard to find.

355
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Name's Sullivan.

356
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,480
Palmer. Ray Palmer.

357
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah.
Well, see you around, Sergeant.

358
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,680
Officer Sullivan.

359
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
Can certainly set your watch
to that fine constable.

360
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,840
We need a plan B.
If Ray can't get this gun,

361
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
the last thing we need is

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,080
Bugsy blasting anyone else out
of existence.

363
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah, well,
maybe a stretch of the old legs

364
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,760
and some fresh air
will give us some clarity.

365
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
I think I know
how to get Bugsy's gun.

366
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,560
So, you got my message.

367
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Look, if this is about the money
your friend gave me,

368
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
I already spent it.

369
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,560
I knew you were on the grift
from the moment I laid eyes on you.

370
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,560
And I never once fell
for that Yankee accent of yours.

371
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,240
Well, all right, then.

372
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Well, now that we've dropped
the charades, tell me,

373
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
what is your angle?

374
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,560
I want to take Bugsy down.
Free this town from his sway.

375
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,360
The only way to do that
is to destroy his blackmail stash.

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Webb said he'd found it,

377
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,280
but I'm guessing Bugsy killed him
for snooping too close.

378
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,960
Well, that's bad news for Webb
and good news for me,

379
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
because I know where the stash is.

380
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,800
Well, aren't I the luckiest girl
in the world?

381
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,400
What do you want in exchange?

382
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
I want Bugsy's gun.

383
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,520
You're looking to ice Bugsy?

384
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
No, that bloke's not worth it.

385
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm aiming at the person
who brought him back.

386
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,320
Then we have a deal.

387
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
You get your guy,
I get my freedom.

388
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,040
Now, how exactly are you planning
on stealing Bugsy's prized weapon?

389
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
When we kiss,

390
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll press my hand against his chest,

391
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,520
and then I'll run my hand
all the way down his body,

392
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,200
and then I'll grab it, like this.

393
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,200
- Do you want to know a secret?
- No.

394
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,000
I just turned in my keys
for my place in D.C.

395
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,960
Yes.

396
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,240
Everything I own
is now stuffed inside

397
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,600
a Time Bureau
softball league duffel bag.

398
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm essentially homeless, Rory.

399
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,160
Congratulations.
You're part of the team.

400
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm a vagrant, a vagabond.

401
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
No job, no rent, no kids...

402
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Perfect.

403
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,000
I had so many responsibilities
at the Time Bureau.

404
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,320
People needed me.
You get it?

405
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,040
You see that clown
sitting over there?

406
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,760
The one riddled
with responsibilities.

407
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,440
Look at him. He's miserable.
And he's welcome to it.

408
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,800
I just can't get over the fact
that nobody needs me to do anything.

409
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
Wait.

410
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Nobody needs me to do anything.

411
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,800
<i>You two still at the Blue Iguana?</i>

412
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,920
Yes, Captain.
Just following orders.

413
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,960
Great. I need you and Ava
to create a diversion.

414
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,880
Clear the place out. I'm gonna draw
Bugsy back to the club,

415
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
so we can capture him.

416
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
I can do that.

417
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,440
Always a pleasure, Chief.
The lobster was excellent.

418
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,160
- Stop right there, Mr. Siegel.
- What's the problem, Officer?

419
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,840
I, I just need to search you
before you leave.

420
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,200
This is highly irregular.

421
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,000
Actually, it's quite regular.

422
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,040
A new directive just came down
from Deputy Chief...

423
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Wiggum.

424
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,040
- It's just gonna take a second.
- What are you doing, son?

425
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,200
Mr. Siegel, call for you.
Sounds urgent.

426
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,920
- Siegel here.
- <i>Benjamin, darling,</i>

427
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,040
it's me, your new favorite source
for all things juicy.

428
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,360
Lance. What's the rumpus?

429
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,280
Must be pretty heavy
if you're calling me on the blower.

430
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,840
Well, something is going down
at your club.

431
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,000
Primo blackmail material.
Better leg it over here PDQ.

432
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
Sorry, guys.
Bugsy's leaving the station.

433
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,080
He still has the gun.

434
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,400
<i>Don't worry, big man.</i>

435
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,480
Got it covered.

436
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
You take care now, Mr. Siegel.

437
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,320
Hey, baby.

438
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,800
You back to working the beat,
Sergeant?

439
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,880
I was just admiring
Mr. Siegel's automobile.

440
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,360
- I guess crime really does pay.
- Not today it doesn't.

441
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,000
Because I'm gonna do
something about it.

442
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
You in, or what?

443
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,160
<i>Girl, I must warn you</i>

444
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
<i>I sense something strange in my mind</i>

445
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,640
<i>Situation is serious</i>

446
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
<i>Let's cure it
because we're running out of time</i>

447
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,400
<i>Tell them, girl</i>

448
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,440
<i>It's oh, so beautiful</i>

449
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,640
<i>Relationships, they seem
from the start</i>

450
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,640
<i>It's all so deadly</i>

451
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,920
<i>When love is not together
From the heart</i>

452
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,360
<i>It's driving me out of my mind</i>

453
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,960
<i>That's why it's hard for me to find</i>

454
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,920
<i>Can't get it outta my head</i>

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,760
<i>Miss her, kiss her, love her</i>

456
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,640
<i>That girl is poison</i>

457
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,480
<i>Never trust a big butt and smile</i>

458
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,920
<i>That girl is poison</i>

459
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
- What's going on in there?
- It's awful.

460
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,960
The worst thing
I've seen in my life.

461
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,920
And I was there
when the <i>Hindenburg</i>went down.

462
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,120
<i>She's driving me out of my mind</i>

463
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,520
- That's my girl.
<i>- That's why it's hard for me to find</i>

464
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
<i>I can't get it outta my head</i>

465
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,680
- You know, what I'm talking about.
- What now?

466
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Sing it with me, girl.

467
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,920
We wait. And hope that John gets
that hell gun before Bugsy gets here.

468
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
<i>That girl is poison</i>

469
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,440
- Right.
<i>- That girl is poison</i>

470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
See you at home, baby.

471
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,120
I got to go. Something's stirring.

472
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,720
- <i>Girl, I'm a warrior</i>
- What is all this?

473
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
You bring me all the way down here

474
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,120
just so I can watch some
no-name dame

475
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
humiliate herself on stage?

476
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,920
First of all, she is not a no-name.
That is my girlfriend.

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,560
And second,
she's not humiliating herself.

478
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
- Yes, she is.
- She's enjoying herself.

479
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,920
So, this was just a lousy trick
to get me down here?

480
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,720
- There's no dirt, is there?
- The dirt is you.

481
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
You're supposed to be dead.

482
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,000
Instead, you're blackmailing your way
to the top.

483
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,880
After I came back,
I realized that violence and murder,

484
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,160
that only gets you so far.

485
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,800
Information.
That's the real power in this world.

486
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Well, whatever your deal is,
you're screwing up history,

487
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,200
and it is my job to stop you.

488
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,840
So, you don't have to go to hell,
but you can't stay here.

489
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Oh, I ain't going anywhere,
Lance.

490
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,040
Jeanie!

491
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,880
<i>Never trust the one...</i>

492
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,720
Should we tell her
the mission is over?

493
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,720
No, let her finish.

494
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
<i>Sing</i>

495
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
So embarrassing.

496
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,200
<i>Dragon Girl.</i>
Is this when you became famous?

497
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,840
Yes. First agent when I was 11.
He was a real piece of work.

498
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,760
Eventually I took control
of everything.

499
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,000
Can I ask you something?

500
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,000
When you first saw me,
did you feel like we met before?

501
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Maybe. I meet a lot of fans.

502
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,440
No. I mean,
we met in another life.

503
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
- Yeah, I totally got that vibe.
- Oh, so it's not all in my head.

504
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,840
I feel like I've been living out
this Taylor Swift song,

505
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,400
but it feels crazy good.

506
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,560
We're definitely connected somehow,
but something feels off.

507
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,440
I think the you I remember
wasn't a professor.

508
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,960
Come on. I know Behrad's
been lying to my parents

509
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,280
about business school for years.

510
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,720
I only want to make sure

511
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,520
that he's been taking really
good care of our family's totem.

512
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
Which he has been.

513
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,120
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

514
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
You, dude, we're cutting the cake,

515
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,040
and they're asking
for the special guest.

516
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Come on.

517
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,440
Chill, B.
Your friend and I were just talking.

518
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,560
- Sure you were. Let's go.
- Good talk.

519
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,040
- Bye, Professor.
- I warned you.

520
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,360
Bye. Stop pushing.

521
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
{\an5}How did you figure out
what these numbers meant?

522
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,200
Well, I spend more time in graveyards
than I care to admit.

523
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,600
Elysian is a common moniker for them.

524
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,520
And those numbers,
they represent a specific location

525
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,320
for a particular gravestone.

526
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,000
There's something here.

527
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
Let's see, shall we?

528
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
That's it.

529
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,480
Well, aren't we a pair
of jammy bastards?

530
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,600
Now, it's time to destroy it.

531
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,840
Forget the matches.
Step away from the briefcase.

532
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh, hold on now, love.

533
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,560
We're all on the same side here.

534
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
There's only one side I'm on,
John.

535
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,760
And that's mine.

536
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,880
You told me you wanted
to destroy that stash

537
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
so that you and everyone else
in the town could be free.

538
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, but I figured why destroy it
when I could just use it for myself?

539
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm sick and tired of
people taking advantage of me.

540
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,520
With this briefcase, I'll finally
have some real power around here.

541
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,000
Look, I understand your anger,

542
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,240
but as soon as
you touch Bugsy's dirt,

543
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,000
then you'll have a target
on your back, just like him.

544
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
But if you leave now...

545
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,040
You can start over,
have a new life.

546
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,040
Look, you don't have to do this,
Jeanie.

547
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,200
Just walk away.

548
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,400
Walk away?

549
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,880
Do you really expect me
to give up this power

550
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,600
after being so powerless
my whole life?

551
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
You know, what?

552
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
You're right.

553
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,120
Who am I to tell you
what to do anyway?

554
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,760
See? It's working already.

555
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,840
Okay, what do we do now?

556
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,080
Once Bugsy's girl gets back
to her car with the stash,

557
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
we're gonna take care
of the whole situation.

558
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,960
Take... What do you mean,
"take care of"?

559
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,800
You really are a straight arrow,
aren't you?

560
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Wait a second.

561
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,720
You want to destroy the stash
and Jeanie along with it?

562
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Why?

563
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,640
She's just collateral damage.
It's the cost of war.

564
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,200
You're a police officer.

565
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,720
Did you ever hear the one about
the last good cop in Los Angeles?

566
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,600
It didn't end well for him.

567
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,400
How's this for an ending?

568
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,600
- Get out of the car. Now.
- You sure you want to do that?

569
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,880
If you were coming
all the way to Burbank

570
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,240
just to meet up with your mobster
friends and kill Jeanie,

571
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
why even bring me along?

572
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,120
Because we needed a fall guy.

573
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,280
Come on, boys.
Drinks are on the LAPD.

574
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,480
Well, I guess this is
where we say goodbye, Johnny.

575
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,280
It's been swell.

576
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,960
Five bullets left.

577
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
Use them wisely.

578
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,640
No. No.

579
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Jeanie!

580
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,400
John! Jeanie!

581
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,840
Jeanie.

582
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,160
Jeanie! Jeanie, no!

583
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,400
They killed her.

584
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,720
Forget it, Ray.

585
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,800
It's Burbank.

586
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,000
Hey, holding cell still works.

587
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,560
Who are you people?

588
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,680
- You communists?
- Idiots.

589
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,880
I know you're probably
pretty confused, Mr. Siegel,

590
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,840
but you might as well
make yourself comfortable

591
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,440
because you may be here for a while.

592
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,280
I should blast you straight
to oblivion,

593
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,480
you dumb bastard.

594
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,720
You made Jeanie's life miserable,
and now she's dead because of you.

595
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,960
I may have corrupted
a wannabe starlet,

596
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,240
but you, you created a real monster.

597
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,720
Astra Logue.

598
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,200
You know, what?
It's funny that you mention her.

599
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
I was just about to go and see her.

600
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,600
John, if you're about to do
what I think you're gonna do,

601
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
then you'd better be sure.

602
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,360
- Hand him over, big man.
- Go on.

603
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,920
That's it, big boy.
See, you're my ticket to hell.

604
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,120
Flesh become my flesh.

605
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
Soul become my soul.

606
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,640
Hades, firstborn of Cronus
and Rhea,

607
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,000
I call upon you.

608
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Light her up, big man.

609
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,640
- Hey, Astra says you're banned.
- Is that so?

610
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,040
You just can't stay away, can you?

611
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,960
Careful.
He's still got one bullet left.

612
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,320
I appreciate your concern, Benjamin,
but I'm not worried about him.

613
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,160
We're old friends,
aren't we, Johnny?

614
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,760
So, why don't you tell me

615
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,280
what you came all
the way down here for?

616
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,880
I came all the way down here
to tell you...

617
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,560
That I'm not giving up on you.

618
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,240
And even if it takes me till
the end of my days, I promise you

619
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,720
that I will find a way.

620
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,360
Another meaningless promise made
by the great John Constantine.

621
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
You've gone soft.

622
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,520
Not that soft.

623
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,800
This one's for Jeanie.

624
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,840
I'll be seeing you around, love.

625
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
So, what happened down there?

626
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,280
- I need a drink.
- Not this time.

627
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,520
Is Astra...

628
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,560
When I got down there,
I was swarmed.

629
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Astra had the drop on me.
She knew I was coming.

630
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
- And the gun?
- Is gone.

631
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,640
We'll figure out another way.

632
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Yeah.

633
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,600
Hey, whatever really happened back
there with Astra,

634
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,040
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

635
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,560
What are you talking about, big man?

636
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,360
Just so you know,
if I had "taken care" of Nora

637
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,320
back when we all thought
she was evil,

638
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,480
we wouldn't be happy
and together right now.

639
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,080
I had the chance to pull
the trigger to end all this...

640
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,520
But I couldn't do it.

641
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,840
What's all your grinning about?

642
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,280
I'm just happy there
are still good guys out there.

643
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,200
Even if one of them is
a Master of the Dark Arts.

644
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,200
You know, you're wrong about me, Ray.

645
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,040
But I will save Astra, and you
should know it's just as much for me

646
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,840
as it is for her. All right?

647
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,640
Hey, don't give Ava a hard time
for getting on stage, all right?

648
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,080
I don't want her
to be too embarrassed.

649
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,960
She's not gonna remember a thing.

650
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,720
Well, hello!

651
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,360
Where's my invite
to this party, Mickey boy?

652
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,720
I spat in that.

653
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,800
Old prison habit.

654
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
I...

655
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,160
Cannot believe that I sang
in front of all those people.

656
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,080
I...

657
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,520
I was awesome.

658
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,480
I killed it.

659
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,280
And did you see my backup band?
They were like...

660
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,520
Please, please tell me
somebody got a video.

661
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,320
Actually, we...

662
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,200
And another thing.

663
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,680
Seriously, Sara, I love you so much.

664
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,920
Working that side mish with Rory
was way more fun

665
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,240
than running any stupid Time Bureau.

666
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,000
Like, responsibilities?

667
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,400
- Who needs them?
- Well, good, babe.

668
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm glad you had fun.

669
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,640
Just know there's no small role
on this team. Right, Rory?

670
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Right.

671
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,680
Okay. Night-night, sweetheart.

672
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,240
Look, there is more to Zari
than you give her credit for.

673
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,240
She's buried down deep inside
underneath all that fame.

674
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
You were getting played, man.

675
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,920
Don't feel bad.
She does this all the time.

676
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,880
- I know who you are.
- You do?

677
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,680
Yeah. The more we talked,
the more you looked familiar.

678
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,280
Then I realized
where I knew you from.

679
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,400
The <i>Waverider.</i>

680
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,760
What's a <i>Waverider?</i>No. Heyworld.

681
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,240
Tell me that's not you there
in the star-spangled outfit.

682
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,480
In fact, you were both there.
That's totally you, Behrad.

683
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
Can't believe
I never noticed it before.

684
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,560
What I don't get is
how Heyworld was 24 years ago,

685
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,840
but you two haven't aged a day.

686
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,800
- What the hell is going on?
- Zari, you've finally lost it.

687
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,360
You accuse me of being a fake,
but you're the one living a lie.

688
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,280
<i>- Mâmân. Bâbâ.</i>
- Okay.

689
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,640
- Just hang on.
- No, I will not hang on.

690
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,640
It's time they finally heard
the truth.

691
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,120
What the hell? Where am I?

692
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,280
<i>You are on a 22nd century Timeship.</i>

693
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,960
Designation W-R-2059.

694
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
Currently situated
in the temporal zone.

695
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,560
Hey, guys. Who's your friend?

696
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,680
- We can explain everything.
- Yeah. You better.

697
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,720
Who are you people?

698
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,840
Guys, meet Zari. She's my sister.

699
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,520
Help. Help.

700
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,160
- Help!
- That girl is poison
