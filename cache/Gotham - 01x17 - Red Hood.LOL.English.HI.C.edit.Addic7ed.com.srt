1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:01,879
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:03,304
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

3
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,919
I have some questions
regarding Wayne Enterprises'

4
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:06,320
business affairs.

5
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,057
Where's Jim?

6
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:15,596
Don Falcone thinks you
don't know how to run a club.

7
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,281
- (whistles)
- Hi.

8
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,719
He'll help you out.

9
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:19,853
Those people out there

10
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:22,589
<i>are using us as spare parts.</i>

11
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,825
<i>Unless we do something about it.</i>

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,293
Alfred, can you teach me how to fight?

13
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:27,494
Yes, I can.

14
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,329
<i>BULLOCK: Pretty handy for a valet.</i>

15
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:30,831
<i>ALFRED: Butler, mate.</i>

16
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:31,865
I'm a butler.

17
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:35,102
(tires screeching)

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,016
What the hell is that?

19
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,951
- I made it. Yeah.
- You made it?

20
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:06,887
- So what is it?
- It's a hood.

21
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:08,889
Thought it would, uh,
you know, spice things up.

22
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:10,357
When did we start wearing hoods?

23
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,726
- We didn't.
- W-Was I supposed to get one?

24
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,761
No!

25
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:22,002
(panicked shouting, gasping)

26
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,738
Ladies... And gentlemen,

27
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,473
we are not here for your money!

28
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:28,742
We're here for the bank's money!

29
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,511
So just stay cool and no one will get hurt!

30
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,381
Don't be brave!

31
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,249
Don't be frightened!

32
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:37,684
Just do what you're told!

33
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,419
This will all be over
quicker than that time

34
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,521
I hooked up with a
cheerleader on prom night!

35
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:42,789
(man chuckles)

36
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,224
What are you doing up there?!

37
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,926
Getting 'em fired up.

38
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,993
90 seconds.

39
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,529
Nice and easy, ladies and gentlemen!

40
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:52,432
You know, banks like this
one... Who are insured

41
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:56,503
to death, by the way... Steal
from us every single day!

42
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,673
'Bout time a few of us returned
the favor, don't you think?

43
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,875
60 seconds.

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,177
You're being great, folks! Almost done!

45
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,416
40 seconds.

46
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,551
(gunshots)

47
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,687
(people gasping, shrieking)

48
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,722
- (gun clicking)
- (chuckles)

49
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:17,357
Nothing!

50
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,960
Not a scratch! (cackling)

51
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,996
Th-Thirty seconds.

52
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,531
Let's get out of here!

53
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:30,403
You've been great, ladies
and germs, but we got to go!

54
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,439
(chuckles)

55
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,276
Did you see that?

56
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:39,199
- That guy missed me with, like, six shots.
- He was, old, nervous.

57
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,191
No, no, no, it's the hood. I'm telling you.

58
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:43,660
Damn it. We're cooked.

59
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:45,729
(sirens wailing)

60
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,734
Attention, citizens of Gotham!

61
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,002
What the hell are you doing?!

62
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,837
There you go, everybody!

63
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,372
(cheering, shouting)

64
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,108
Take back what's yours!

65
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,911
(cheering, shouting)

66
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:05,048
Follow me! Come on.

67
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,584
(clamoring)

68
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,430
(indistinct chatter, cameras clicking)

69
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,208
BULLOCK: Well,

70
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:33,577
we'll never know how much cash was lost,

71
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,513
but I just saw a bum eating
oysters at Madeline's.

72
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:39,783
Another freak in a mask. Awesome.

73
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,620
Is that guard blind or wasted?

74
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,789
Clyde refused to wear his glasses.

75
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,591
Said they made him look old.

76
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:50,227
Missing a man standing 20 feet
in front of you with six shots

77
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,595
makes you look old.

78
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,263
- Who tripped the alarm?
- I did.

79
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,799
Why aren't you out there, Detective?

80
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:59,236
This brazen audacity cannot be tolerated.

81
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,005
They didn't go for the
vault... just the cash

82
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,007
in the registers. And
the crew was in and out

83
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,909
in under two minutes.

84
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,711
The red-hooded man seemed nice.

85
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,079
Nice?

86
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,915
He wasn't stealing our
money... just the bank's.

87
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,450
Then he gave a lot of it

88
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,452
back to people in the street. Like...

89
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,255
Robin Hood.

90
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,924
Oh, great. This bank hires Communists.

91
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,460
Robin Hood stole from the
rich and gave to the poor.

92
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,795
These armed thieves only threw cash away

93
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,297
to guarantee their escape.

94
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:29,132
It's very different, ma'am.

95
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,667
The thief

96
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:33,158
in the back here, was he
always checking his watch?

97
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,205
Yes. He was counting down.

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
They knew what our response time was.

99
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,308
They'd done their homework.

100
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:40,277
Has the alarm been triggered
for any other reason recently?

101
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,312
- No.
- Well,

102
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,681
there was that time with the smoke bomb.

103
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:45,749
Smoke bomb?

104
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,218
A week or so ago, a
small flare or firework,

105
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,753
or something, was set
off by the Mortgages desk.

106
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,489
It tripped the alarm. We thought

107
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,558
it was just a kid's prank.

108
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,393
We're gonna need you to
find the surveillance footage

109
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:57,694
from that incident.

110
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,698
- (thunder crashing)
- (knocking on door)

111
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,734
(knocking continues)

112
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,582
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

113
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:23,820
Reggie?

114
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,356
Sorry for calling so late.

115
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,458
Forgive me.

116
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,860
Oh, my God, mate. How long's it been?

117
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,897
20 years.

118
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,934
I got picked up by the GCPD last night

119
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,204
for trying to sleep
under the Westbury Bridge.

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,473
- Here, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

121
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:47,377
One of the officers was
a Marine, back in the day,

122
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,546
so we got to talking. I told him

123
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,549
I was with Her Majesty's Special
Air Service back in the day.

124
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,017
So he took pity on me.

125
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,921
He says, "Why don't you look
up some of your old regiment,

126
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:00,924
you know, see if one of the
guys can... help you out."

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Well, you know...

128
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,730
I'm pleased you looked me up, Reg.

129
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,732
If anyone would've told me

130
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,035
this is where I'd find you,
I wouldn't have believed them.

131
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,220
I like it here.

132
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,507
It's good for me.

133
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,776
I can see that.

134
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,312
I've missed you, mate.

135
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,581
Missed your ugly mug.

136
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:27,884
Cheers.

137
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,517
What happened, Reggie?

138
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,858
Vanessa died.

139
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:37,594
11 years ago now.

140
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,597
I just couldn't find the energy

141
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:44,267
to get back out there after that, you know?

142
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,237
A year later, I lost the house.

143
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,406
Moved back to Gotham.

144
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,675
I've had a few jobs.

145
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,544
Nothing I'm proud of.

146
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,683
It was the drink, Alfie.

147
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,920
It was the drink.

148
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,455
BRUCE: Alfred?

149
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,159
Um, Master Bruce.

150
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,927
This is, uh,

151
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,729
Reginald Payne.

152
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,698
We served together, sir.

153
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,635
Very pleased to meet you, sir.

154
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,303
You were caught in the storm?

155
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,572
Reggie's had a run of
bad luck, Master Bruce.

156
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,908
I-I don't wish to be a nuisance. I just...

157
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:28,178
I hadn't seen Alfie in a very long time.

158
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,781
N-No, I'm glad you found us, Mr. Payne.

159
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:34,317
Please, feel free to
stay with us a few days.

160
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,487
That's very kind of you, but...

161
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:38,588
I insist.

162
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,024
Please.

163
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,330
MOONEY: Where are you taking me?

164
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,532
MAN: This way, Miss Mooney.

165
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,568
(moaning, shouting in distance)

166
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,697
Who chose these people?

167
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,732
Where'd you get them from?

168
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,645
(door shuts)

169
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,248
(lock clicks)

170
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,885
Sit, please.

171
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,258
Sit.

172
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,636
There you are, Mr. Red Hood.

173
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,571
Armed robbery perps dating back ten years.

174
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,907
I took out the dead ones
and the ones in prison.

175
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,241
A who's who of scumbags.

176
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,811
They were casing the place a
week before they took it down.

177
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,380
Set off the alarm then timed the response.

178
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,916
He looks pretty young.
He might not be in here.

179
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,190
You see that?

180
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,392
No, 'cause you took my glasses.

181
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,227
Right there, underneath his coat.

182
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,696
He's wearing a work shirt.

183
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,731
"Kleg's Auto."

184
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,703
Idiot. (chuckles)

185
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,738
(music blaring)

186
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,777
(chuckles)

187
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,946
"The Red Hood Gang"! (chuckles)

188
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,781
It's got a ring to it.

189
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,449
- No, it doesn't.
- See those people?

190
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,750
They loved me.

191
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,219
They loved the money you threw at 'em.

192
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,887
Thanks for that, by the way.

193
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,388
Shall we take it out of your share?

194
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,790
You guys don't get it.

195
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,459
We're not just five mooks
with shotguns anymore.

196
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,127
We're the Red Hood Gang.

197
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,597
Taking from the rich and
giving back to the poor.

198
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:02,465
Mark my words,

199
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,968
the people in this town,
they're gonna get me.

200
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,071
- Us.
- Will you shut up?

201
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,973
All that prancing around
could have gotten us killed.

202
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:12,242
You're wrong. That guard,
he was 20 feet away from me.

203
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,610
Not one shot got close.

204
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:14,511
Luck!

205
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:17,013
He looked r-real nervous.

206
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:17,914
It's the hood!

207
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,616
It's good luck. I'm telling you.

208
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,618
I feel like a totally
different person with it on.

209
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:22,986
Eh, sit down, will ya?

210
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:24,487
We need to go over tomorrow's score.

211
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,656
Nah, this sets us apart.

212
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:30,093
It's a piece of cloth...
Two holes cut out of it.

213
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,729
It's a symbol!

214
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,998
Whoever wears the hood

215
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,366
- should lead!
- (gunshot)

216
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:37,734
(grunts)

217
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,907
(grunting)

218
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,482
He's right.

219
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,785
Any objections?

220
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:07,625
So...

221
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,020
you're the one causing all of the fuss.

222
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,106
The one with the knife now.

223
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,174
This is your facility?

224
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,376
I manage it, yes.

225
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,544
But do you own it?

226
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,246
The doctor owns it.

227
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,050
Where are you going?

228
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,786
Back to the basement. We're done here.

229
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,754
Miss Mooney...

230
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,228
Take a seat.

231
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,197
I will talk to the doctor
and the doctor only.

232
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,900
He's away on a consultation in Gotham.

233
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,702
Then call me when he returns.

234
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,038
<i>He expressly asked me</i>

235
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,206
to attend to your demands.

236
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,810
His name.

237
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,412
I'm sorry?

238
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,248
The doctor. His name.

239
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,452
Dulmacher.

240
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:06,625
You tell Dr. Dulmacher

241
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,227
that the basement is mine.

242
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,430
No one will leave

243
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,299
unless I say so. It will remain that way

244
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,568
until he sits with me

245
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,703
and negotiates terms.

246
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,181
Perhaps...

247
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,817
you and I got off on the
wrong foot, Miss Mooney.

248
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,485
When was the last time

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,788
you had a shower? A
new set of clothes? Hmm?

250
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,157
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

251
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,258
(door opens)

252
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:43,128
Take Miss Mooney to my private bathroom,

253
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,631
and then pick up some fresh
clothes for her from storage.

254
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,300
Freshen up.

255
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,968
Come back to me.

256
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,537
And then perhaps we'll talk some more.

257
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,276
<i>COMEDIAN: So the mortician says</i>

258
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,745
to the waitress... No, the
waitress says to the mortician,

259
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,748
(clears throat) "He was always stiff."

260
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,950
MAN 2: That's it.

261
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,219
- Let's go.
- Wait. No.

262
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,156
Have a good night. See
you next week, sir. Okay.

263
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:15,026
- It's fine. We got, uh...
- Check, please.

264
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,362
- (whispering)
- COMEDIAN: cards.

265
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,830
Oh, okay. Um...

266
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,365
What's wrong?

267
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,634
Ah, Mr. Penguin. I mean
the Penguin. I mean...

268
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,669
- I...
- What is it?

269
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:27,239
We're out of booze.

270
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,709
What? Hello? Behind you,
there's a wall of booze.

271
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,178
Just colored water, sir. Always has been.

272
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:37,315
We keep the real stuff
down here, but we're out.

273
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:40,185
- So, duh, order more.
- We did.

274
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,353
It's just that...

275
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,022
GILZEAN: It's Maroni's booze.

276
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,058
And he's a little grumpy
with you these days.

277
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,230
He was hardly a fan of Fish, either.

278
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,167
Why did he sell her booze?

279
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,501
Business is business.

280
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,004
But he hates you with a passion.

281
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,407
- But he can't kill you, so...
- That's...

282
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,943
This is ridiculous. There's a
thousand places to buy booze.

283
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,945
That's where it gets complicated.

284
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,448
See, Maroni, he supplies
this whole side of town.

285
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,351
No one would dare cross him to help you.

286
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:14,386
(patrons booing, glass shattering)

287
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,387
Help...

288
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,555
WOMAN: Get outta here!

289
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,557
Thank you. Bye. Sorry.

290
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,258
- You're not funny.
- (patrons murmur, catcall)

291
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,728
(snickering): You must take
great pleasure watching me fail.

292
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,463
On the contrary.

293
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,399
I was with Fish

294
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,902
when we took this place off a
Chinese bookie nine years ago.

295
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,038
It was used for cock fighting.

296
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,207
Took forever to get the smell out.

297
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,544
My blood, sweat, and
tears are in this dive.

298
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,015
Well, if you'll excuse me,

299
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,185
it seems as though I need
to procure some alcohol

300
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,255
for my dwindling clientele.

301
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,758
Be careful.

302
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:57,095
You've seen what happens
when you cross Maroni.

303
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,374
GCPD!

304
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,417
Looks like they were here last night.

305
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:20,619
Hey.

306
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,287
Your hot doctor friend, Thompkins...

307
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,222
- Leslie.
- Whatever.

308
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,525
Give me the double D... "dirty details."

309
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,661
Don't leave anything out.

310
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,196
(chuckles)

311
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,264
Gotta hand it to you, partner.

312
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,565
You don't sit around moping.

313
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,268
You got right back up on the hobby horse.

314
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,969
Let's just hope you can
keep your head straight

315
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,971
whilst up there.

316
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,607
You had the purse. Now
you got yourself a nurse.

317
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,876
(chuckles)

318
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,880
Well, looks like I found our friend Floyd.

319
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,722
What? If I don't drink it, Forensics will.

320
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,527
GORDON: All right. This
was the guy with the hood.

321
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,195
He's wearing the same coat.

322
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,198
I wonder what he did to piss
off the rest of his crew.

323
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,401
Maybe they knew we'd catch up to him.

324
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,536
Well, he was the leader,
so it looks like we've seen

325
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,572
the last of the Red Hood crew now.

326
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:18,910
(people screaming)

327
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,713
Good morning, everyone!

328
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,150
(grunting)

329
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,520
Get off me! I got it.

330
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,021
Okay. We're not here

331
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,690
for your money.

332
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,758
We're here for the insurance!

333
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,561
I mean the bank's insured money!

334
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,996
60 seconds.

335
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,232
MAN: Hey! You gonna share a little
bit of that cash with us, Hood?

336
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,233
(others agreeing)

337
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,736
Th-Thirty seconds.

338
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,672
- (grunts)
- Come on. A lot of us

339
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,773
are hurting here.

340
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,908
(others agreeing)

341
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,777
Ten seconds.
L-L... L-Let's go!

342
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:53,912
Aw, fine.

343
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,615
(laughs)

344
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,884
(cheering, shouting)

345
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,355
So long, Gotham!

346
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,457
Sayonara!

347
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,256
And then there were four.

348
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,726
People are gonna hang out
in banks waiting for handouts

349
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,227
from these idiots.

350
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:21,396
We're never gonna catch a
crew no one wants us to catch.

351
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,497
Call me old-fashioned, but when crooks

352
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,632
become more popular than cops,

353
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,968
- that's anarchy.
- Think about it.

354
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,270
As long as somebody's willing
to put that red hood on,

355
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,972
this gang can go on forever.

356
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,240
ALVAREZ: Hey, guys.

357
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,042
Got somebody here you might want to meet.

358
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,777
- This is Mister...
- Chaing.

359
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,113
Chaing, right. He's an eyewitness.

360
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:39,681
From the bank?

361
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,349
I work at a restaurant a block away.

362
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:43,651
The Red Hood Gang parked
their van there this morning.

363
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,286
I was throwing out the trash

364
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,621
when they ran back to it.

365
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:47,822
You see their faces?

366
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,891
Just one... the fat one with the hood.

367
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:51,426
He took it off to drive.

368
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,763
- I'll get the sketch artist.
- Well, wait a minute.

369
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,499
Got the armed robbery files already opened.

370
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,101
Maybe he can look through them,
see if he recognizes someone.

371
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:02,637
Maybe that someone is a
known associate of Gus Floyd.

372
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:05,406
Only problem is records are kind of
old... he might look different now.

373
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,809
We could pull a few based
off Chaing's description.

374
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,011
Get ourselves a good old-fashioned lineup.

375
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:13,181
Wait. Wait a second. What's in it for me?

376
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,884
I got all these parking tickets

377
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,219
because my ex-wife is a crazy bitch.

378
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:20,789
We'll see what we can do.

379
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,365
(panting)

380
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,402
Training for a fight?

381
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,407
Just training.

382
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,042
Who's helping you?

383
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:43,311
Alfred.

384
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,646
Good choice.

385
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,015
Show me your stance.

386
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,257
Good.

387
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,725
Hit me.

388
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,360
(grunts)

389
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,863
Again.

390
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,733
- (grunts)
- And don't hold back.

391
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,435
You have a go at me, son.

392
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,103
(grunting)

393
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:09,904
(shouts)

394
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,574
Come on.

395
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,576
It should take more than
that to piss you off, son.

396
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,244
Come on.

397
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,512
Again.

398
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,080
Come on.

399
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,949
- (grunts)
- (shouts)

400
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:23,184
(Reggie laughing)

401
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,686
(grunting)

402
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,188
Now, now. Never lose your cool.

403
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,723
It'll get you killed.

404
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:31,292
Now, you want to hit me, right?
You want to hit me, right?

405
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,428
Okay. Take a swing.

406
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,630
Take a swing. Go on. Do it.

407
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,032
(grunts)

408
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:39,701
Somebody gives you a free shot,

409
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,135
you got to make it count.

410
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,637
You hit me as hard as you can.

411
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:44,305
- (grunts)
- Oh. Better.

412
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,440
Put your shoulder behind it.

413
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,041
Put your full body weight behind it.

414
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,209
Go on. Do it.

415
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:49,237
(shouts) (grunts)

416
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:50,879
Harder. Again.

417
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:53,047
(shouts) (grunts)

418
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,551
Again.

419
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:57,986
Come on. Do it again.

420
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,121
Put me on my back, son.
Come on, you can do it.

421
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,422
Come on. Again.

422
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,992
- You're so much bigger than me!
- Then use that to your advantage!

423
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:07,161
You hit me low. Hit me
in the knee, the ankle.

424
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,964
Forget about the gloves!
Use whatever's around you.

425
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Here. Here.

426
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,470
- Go on.
- ALFRED: Right!

427
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,972
That's enough of that.

428
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,610
Perhaps a shower's in order, Master Bruce.

429
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:27,120
M-Mr. Payne was just showing
me some alternative methods.

430
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,651
Yeah, I can see that, can't I?

431
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,187
Not methods that fit into our
curriculum, though, are they?

432
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,189
No, they're not; but they're effective.

433
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:37,292
Discipline, skill,

434
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,694
and hard work are effective.

435
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,167
How 'bout I start that shower for you, sir?

436
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,138
No.

437
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:58,469
(door opens upstairs, then shuts)

438
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,424
You ever raised a child before, Reg?

439
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,584
- No.
- Me neither.

440
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:09,991
Hardest job I've ever had to do in my life.

441
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:12,827
Nothing prepares you for it.

442
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:14,829
Listen, I'm sorry if
I overstepped the mark.

443
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:16,531
I was just...

444
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,499
It was obvious how much
you've helped him s...

445
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,234
No, he helped me.

446
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:25,907
I'm a better person for knowing him, Reg.

447
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,879
Let's keep our past where it belongs.

448
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,717
In the past.

449
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,471
(snickering): That's it? Just two workers?

450
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:00,675
This'll be easy. Make it quick, guys.

451
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,077
(sirens wailing)

452
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,718
Well, this is inconvenient.

453
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:12,353
WORKMAN: Whoa, Officer.

454
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:15,056
- Nothing going on here.
- That so?

455
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,891
Eh, your liquor license is out of date.

456
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,793
We're gonna be confiscating the shipment.

457
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,528
Hey, does Don Maroni
know you guys are here?

458
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:24,065
Walk away... before I run you downtown.

459
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,955
This town is truly going to the dogs.

460
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,605
- Evening, fellas.
- (Oswald gasps)

461
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,940
- (gun cocks)
- (mutters indistinctly)

462
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,276
(panting)

463
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,911
Why the smile, Butch?

464
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,413
First Maroni blocks our liquor,

465
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:39,947
and now the cops?

466
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,717
Oh, who, them? They're with me.

467
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,553
I always keep a few uniforms in the closet.

468
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:48,723
A lot cleaner than going in
guns blazing, don't you think?

469
00:22:50,393 --> 00:22:52,126
You're welcome, Oswald.

470
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:54,062
(chuckles)

471
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:56,097
(siren wailing in distance)

472
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,032
Nice work there.

473
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,033
How you doing, Mr. Gilzean?

474
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:00,034
GILZEAN: This over here, this...

475
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,803
OFFICER: Nothing to worry about.

476
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,056
You okay?

477
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:34,894
Of course.

478
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,897
Thank you for letting us stay here.

479
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,232
Sorry it got a little messy.

480
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,500
I was just about to go.

481
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:43,670
I like having you guys here.

482
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:48,274
(coughs)

483
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,309
Selina...

484
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,212
Come here.

485
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,451
You know, you're turning into
quite the beautiful woman.

486
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,354
No, I'm not.

487
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,257
Remove the dirt...

488
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,859
that old hood...

489
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,827
these ratty clothes...

490
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,072
I bet we find a princess undernea...

491
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,704
I have an idea.

492
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,910
Holy moly.

493
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,212
Take anything that fits you guys.

494
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:28,214
This is all stuff you've worn?

495
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,984
Most of it.

496
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,119
You sure must go out a lot.

497
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,654
I used to.

498
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,365
Come with me.

499
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,681
You're a true beauty.

500
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:06,352
Something you can use to your advantage.

501
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:10,490
Your appearance can be a weapon,

502
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:14,527
as powerful as any knife or gun.

503
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,533
Yeah?

504
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,507
What good's it done you?

505
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,213
(door opens)

506
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,822
BULLOCK (over speaker): All
right, backs to the wall.

507
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,424
Hold your numbers up.

508
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,459
No talking.

509
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,197
I thought they were
going to be similar types.

510
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,133
- They are.
- Uh-huh.

511
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:57,203
- Look closely, Mr. Chaing.
- I know how this works.

512
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,475
There, number four... The short, fat one.

513
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,832
- You're sure?
- That's your Red Hood.

514
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,413
Threw all that money away,
and I didn't get a cent.

515
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:10,083
Clyde Destro, 47 years old, conviction

516
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:13,052
for assault and armed robbery of a
convenience store three years ago.

517
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,888
- Let's book him.
- Wait a minute.

518
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:18,157
All we have is one witness outside
of the crime scene, that's it.

519
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:20,894
Now, Floyd was killed, so we know
they're turning on each other.

520
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,429
- Let Destro go?
- And tail him.

521
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,931
He takes us to the other gang members.

522
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,499
We use them against each other.

523
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:28,601
We catch the Red Hood Gang red-handed.

524
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:29,736
That's right.

525
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,170
Can I get a ride home?

526
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,141
My girlfriend will freak out
if I turn up in a patrol car.

527
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,212
(door opens)

528
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,815
Well...

529
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,485
don't you look lovely?

530
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,586
(door closes)

531
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,255
There's still business to discuss.

532
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,690
Of course.

533
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,191
The basement.

534
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,193
How do I resume operations?

535
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,863
We do have a business to run.

536
00:26:56,898 --> 00:27:00,300
Yes, you're stealing body parts.

537
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,535
- For who?
- Oh!

538
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,637
We have clients...

539
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:07,941
all over the world in need of such things.

540
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:11,878
Also, there's the doctor's

541
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,913
personal experiments.

542
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:21,872
You have such a presence,

543
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,156
Miss Mooney.

544
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:26,993
Such a gaze.

545
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,763
Your eyes...

546
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,199
will fetch quite a penny.

547
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:37,770
You will take nothing from me.

548
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:38,871
Really?

549
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,275
Because the way I see it,
you have two choices: One...

550
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,144
we kill you and your little
friends in the basement.

551
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,815
That's an inconvenience
but an acceptable one.

552
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,850
Or, two...

553
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,954
we take your eyes now

554
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,891
and see how long a blind girl
can survive in the basement.

555
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,831
You forgot option three.

556
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:05,732
(grunts)

557
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,735
- Stop her!
- (both scream)

558
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,746
- No!
- (spoon clinks)

559
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,676
(thud)

560
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,304
(thunder rumbles; Alfred
and Reggie converse quietly)

561
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,740
I picked something out from the cellar.

562
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,642
I hope that's okay.

563
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,871
Well, that's, uh, extremely kind of you,

564
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:36,907
Master Bruce, but I don't think that we...

565
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:41,144
that I'll be, uh, drinking this evening.

566
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,579
I'm sure it's perfectly fine to have

567
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:44,547
a glass of wine occasionally, Alfred.

568
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,549
I-I picked an old one.

569
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:48,818
Seems a shame to let them
gather dust down there.

570
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:54,190
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

571
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:00,797
It's a rather nice Burgundy,
actually, it's 1966.

572
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,700
Yeah.

573
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:05,568
It's one of your father's favorites.

574
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,904
(chuckles)

575
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:13,410
Why not, eh? Take a pew.

576
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,214
That's very kind of you.

577
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,483
- There you go.
- Cheers, mate.

578
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,090
Now, the idea, of course,

579
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:30,727
is to let it breathe for at least an hour.

580
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:35,765
Or not.

581
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,867
- (slurps)
- (laughs)

582
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:40,370
Ah. Delicious.

583
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,172
(laughter)

584
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,307
So he eventually opened his backpack

585
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,709
and he found the bloody snake.

586
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,777
We'd been waiting for it all night.

587
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:49,346
He didn't even flinch.

588
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,281
- What'd you do?
- Oh, you know,

589
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:53,950
I chopped its head off and
we ate the bloody thing.

590
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:56,252
- (laughter)
- He did.

591
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:57,387
What did it taste like?

592
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,956
ALFRED: Uh, a bit like, um, fast food.

593
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,358
(all laugh)

594
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,659
ALFRED: It was horrible.

595
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,295
It was horrible. It was disgusting.

596
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,997
BRUCE: So, um...

597
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,965
so, Mr. Payne, you were in the Air Force?

598
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,801
Special Air Service... SAS.

599
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,370
Best soldiers in the world,

600
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:15,538
if I'm being honest.

601
00:30:15,574 --> 00:30:17,941
So that means covert missions?

602
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:20,076
That's right.

603
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,811
Before a conflict, they dropped us

604
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:23,780
behind enemy lines.

605
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:27,917
We were quiet, precise, and deadly.

606
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,619
We never lost a man

607
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,654
and we always completed our missions.

608
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,009
Except that once, I guess.

609
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,995
Yeah, well, that's enough of
the old war stories, eh, Reg?

610
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,997
What one time?

611
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,000
REGGIE: There was a sandstorm.

612
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,336
We got separated.

613
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,738
Two of us were captured.

614
00:30:48,774 --> 00:30:50,840
You?

615
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,612
He fought 12 of them off
before they cut him down.

616
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,048
Didn't you, Alf?

617
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,118
I'm here now, aren't I?

618
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:03,486
That's all that matters.

619
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:04,954
(sniffs)

620
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,290
All right, gents, while I have to
say this has been absolutely lovely,

621
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,125
I'd like to,

622
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,227
I'd like to tidy up before I go to bed.

623
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:13,430
(scoffing):
T-T-Tidy up?

624
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:15,932
Mr. Yes Sir, No Sir.

625
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,468
Mr. Queensberry rules and discipline.

626
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:19,702
Thank you, that's enough.

627
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,742
Alfred's right... it's time for bed.

628
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,045
Good night, Master Bruce.

629
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:30,713
BRUCE: Good night. Good night.

630
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,749
Sleep well, son.

631
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:36,719
Why are you hiding from
him what you really are,

632
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:38,388
who you really are?

633
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:43,026
You're a war dog, Alfie.

634
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:46,029
You're a cold-blooded,

635
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:49,332
lethal war dog, is what you are.

636
00:31:53,572 --> 00:31:56,039
I found some fresh clothes for you, Reg.

637
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:58,141
I folded them and I put 'em on your bed,

638
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:00,510
and I've taken the liberty of packing you

639
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,813
a lunch for your travels tomorrow.

640
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,382
It's been really nice to see you, Reggie.

641
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,154
I see them, at night... when I'm alone.

642
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:14,424
The faces...

643
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:17,260
the faces of those we killed.

644
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:18,695
Do you?

645
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,031
I don't have to look for them, Reg.

646
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,503
They find me.

647
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:59,002
(startled shout)

648
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:01,271
(gasps, chuckles)

649
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:03,173
Holy crap.

650
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,908
You scared the snot out of me.

651
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,310
H-Had to see you.
I c-couldn't wait.

652
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,846
- Where were you?
- Out.

653
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,115
J-Just out?

654
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,350
What's it to you?

655
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:16,586
I need the hood.

656
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:17,587
What?

657
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,455
- No.
- M...

658
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,457
My-my girlfriend, sh-she
wants... she wants to leave.

659
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:24,494
She... she called me a loser last night.

660
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,896
Her ex is back in town. He's a b-bouncer.

661
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,498
I figured she-she sees me

662
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,834
in the hood, she's got... she's
got to take me s-seriously.

663
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,470
Did you ransack my place looking for it?

664
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,772
I need it, Destro.

665
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,308
They're talking about it on the streets

666
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:40,398
and in the news. She
sees me in it, and I'm...

667
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:41,851
No!

668
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:44,681
We have one last job before
we split up and skip town.

669
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:51,955
(gun cocks)

670
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,690
You have it on you, don't you?

671
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:56,759
You better use that thing

672
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,861
before I make you eat it.

673
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,165
(gunshot)

674
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,671
(door creaking)

675
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:14,043
- (gasping weakly)
- He's alive.

676
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,646
(stairs rattling)

677
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,047
Who shot you, Destro? Give us the name

678
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,049
- of the guy.
- I need an ambulance.

679
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:22,352
We'll get to that. Give us the
names of the guys in your crew.

680
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,220
I'm bleeding out.

681
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:25,521
Yeah, you're dying.

682
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:27,490
And, unfortunately, I'm
not getting cell reception.

683
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,691
You know what might help?

684
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,827
Giving us the names of
the guys in your crew!

685
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,161
GORDON: I need an ambulance.

686
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,030
Java Heights and Homewood, apartment 466.

687
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:37,233
I might need some pressure on this wound.

688
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:39,736
- Knock yourself out.
- (panting)

689
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:43,740
What do you got there, partner?

690
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:45,808
A stack of loan rejection
letters from the banks

691
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:47,277
that were robbed.

692
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,946
"Dear Mr. Destro, we regret
to inform you your application

693
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,547
for a loan has been denied."

694
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,217
"Mr. Destro, once again, we
must deny your application,

695
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:55,785
due to inadequate collateral."

696
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,620
What the hell would he need a loan for?

697
00:34:57,656 --> 00:34:59,289
Pastry shop.

698
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,557
Get out of here. You're a baker?

699
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:03,426
A damn good baker.

700
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:04,761
And they all turned you down.

701
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,896
So these are revenge robberies.

702
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:08,865
Banks don't care about people like me.

703
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,067
Or you, probably.

704
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:13,536
You have to force people to see you.

705
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,605
Otherwise, you're nothing.

706
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,074
There's a third letter here.
International Savings Bank

707
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,543
of Gotham... this was the next target.

708
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,545
Where's my ambulance?

709
00:35:35,794 --> 00:35:38,828
To new beginnings.

710
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,430
(sniffs)

711
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:42,231
I'm not trying to poison you, son.

712
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,067
Forgive me if I'm a little cautious.

713
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,935
If this club tanks,

714
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,771
Falcone's not gonna
trust either of us again.

715
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:50,940
I don't know about you,

716
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,943
but I'm done playing the sidekick.

717
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:58,981
To no longer being a sidekick.

718
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:17,100
Do you miss her?

719
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,169
I do.

720
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:21,571
(chuckles)

721
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:23,039
Even after everything she did to me.

722
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,343
Perhaps it's not our friends but...

723
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,545
our enemies that define us.

724
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:34,016
To Fish.

725
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:39,455
She got what she deserved.

726
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:48,097
(thunder rumbling)

727
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
(rattling, clattering)

728
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:01,577
(rattling, clattering continue)

729
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:10,686
You're stealing from us?

730
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:13,990
You could have just
asked me for money, Reg.

731
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:18,327
You don't know how hard
that is, Alfie... do you?

732
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,663
We gave you somewhere to sleep.

733
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:23,499
We put food in your belly.

734
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,868
I'm in trouble.

735
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,603
Real trouble.

736
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,672
I don't need a lecture right now.

737
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:37,079
What kind of trouble?

738
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:39,015
You don't want to know.

739
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,484
Right. Well, you put the bag down

740
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,486
and you leave.

741
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:46,289
Now.

742
00:37:46,324 --> 00:37:50,526
Did you bring a gun, Alfie?

743
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,929
No.

744
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:56,265
If there was any other way...

745
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:59,302
Oh, come on... there's
always another way, mate.

746
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,039
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,240
Sorry f...

748
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,742
(grunting)

749
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:10,313
I'm so sorry.

750
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,750
(coughs)

751
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:31,567
(no voice)

752
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:34,170
(dialing phone)

753
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:35,371
Th-This is Bruce Wayne.

754
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:37,340
I need immediate help at Wayne Manor!

755
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,641
My friend has been stabbed.

756
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:45,281
Alfred... Alfred, Alfred, look
at me... you're gonna be okay.

757
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:47,283
Alfred, stay with me.

758
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:49,652
(voice breaking): Please.

759
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,526
Alfred!

760
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:02,955
(tires screech)

761
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:09,055
There's only three of us.

762
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,189
I'm worried. If someone
makes a move in there...

763
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:13,226
Don't be.

764
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,260
I have this.

765
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:27,993
(tires screeching)

766
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:31,860
GORDON (over bullhorn): GCPD!

767
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:33,826
We have you surrounded!

768
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:37,860
This doesn't have to end
badly! Put down your guns!

769
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:39,260
Suck it, coppers!

770
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:42,093
(gunfire)

771
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,226
(laughing)

772
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,360
OFFICER (echoing): Man down! Man down!

773
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,726
(clicking) GORDON: Hold your fire!

774
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:00,727
OFFICER: Hold your fire!

775
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:02,726
Drop it!

776
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:07,093
It's over.

777
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:09,760
Yeah?

778
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:12,260
Don't be so sure.

779
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:14,093
(gunfire)

780
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:34,826
(sniffs)

781
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:45,493
I need a Danish.

782
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:50,593
(phone ringing)

783
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,626
Yeah.

784
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:59,226
Which hospital?

785
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,260
(monitor beeping steadily)

786
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,760
(voice breaking): I can't lose him.

787
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,760
He's all I have.

788
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:31,626
(crying)

789
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:47,326
REGGIE: He has nothing concrete.

790
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:51,793
Just faces, some dates,

791
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:53,793
some newspaper articles.

792
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:56,726
There's no grounds for an investigation.

793
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,193
Just... suspicions...

794
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:02,360
some cobbled-together theories...

795
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,026
Nothing.

796
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,193
WOMAN: Has he had outside counsel?

797
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,326
I don't think so.

798
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,726
WOMAN: And his caretaker, Mr. Pennyworth?

799
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:15,193
He's in the hospital.

800
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:17,793
WOMAN: For how long?

801
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:19,793
If he lives,

802
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:23,726
a few weeks, give or take.

803
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:27,860
Now's the time to make a move on the kid.

804
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,026
Thank you for your service, Mr. Payne.

805
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,892
I doubt we'll meet again.

806
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:49,293
He's just a kid.

807
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:53,093
A good kid.

808
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:57,374
Good-bye, Mr. Payne.

809
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:21,927
(mimics gunshot)
