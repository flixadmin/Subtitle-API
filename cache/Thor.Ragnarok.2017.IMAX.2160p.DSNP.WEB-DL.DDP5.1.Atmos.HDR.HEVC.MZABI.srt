1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,520
THOR: Now, I know
what you're thinking.

2
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,040
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured

4
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,720
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,280
It's a long story,

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,360
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,080
See, I spent some time
on Earth...

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,720
fought some robots,

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
saved the planet
a couple of times.

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,920
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,240
That's when I came across

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,080
a path of death
and destruction...

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,000
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,920
where I met you.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Hmm.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,760
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,440
Thor, son of Odin.

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,320
Surtur, son of a bitch.

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
You're still alive.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,960
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,760
I cannot die.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,640
Not until
I fulfill my destiny...

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,080
and lay waste to your home.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,760
It's funny
you should mention that.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,640
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
And you, Surtur,

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
are at the center
of all of them.

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,600
-The great prophecy...
-Hang on.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
-Hang on.
-

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,280
I'll be back around shortly.

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,360
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
Okay, so Ragnarok.

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,280
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,440
My time has come.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
I shall be restored
to my full might.

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,000
I will tower
over the mountains...

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,720
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
THOR: Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
I swear I'm not even moving.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
It's just doing this
on its own.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,160
-I'm really sorry.
-

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,800
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,360
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,680
A mountain!

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,880
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Odin is not on Asgard.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,720
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,760
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

56
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
Oh, that's a crown.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,680
I thought it was
a big eyebrow.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a crown.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,560
is rip that thing
off your head.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,400
But Ragnarok
has already begun.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,400
You cannot stop it.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,200
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,920
All will suffer,
all will burn.

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh, that's intense.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,800
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big...

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,320
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,240
where I bust
out of these chains...

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,160
knock that tiara
off your head,

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,640
Why fight it?

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,520
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,520
Hmm.

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,520
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
-Hmm?

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
And, now!

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,840
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,560
I make grave mistakes
all the time.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Everything seems to work out.

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Huh?

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
but I could really use
a fast exit.

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
Heimdall?

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
SKURGE: Heimdall was an idiot.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,680
This job should have
made him rich.

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,040
Now, the job ain't easy...

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
but it does have its benefits.

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,560
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,560
the Nine Realms has to offer.

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,040
I mean it's all mine
for the taking.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Behold...

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,080
my stuff.

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Ooh.

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm particularly fond
of these.

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,720
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

98
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,960
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,200
You see,
when you put them together...

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,240
they destroy.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,280
Heimdall, come on.

102
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,640
Stay!

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,240
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
-Heimdall?
-

105
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,480
Um... Skurge?

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,280
Is that important?

107
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
SKURGE: You girls
are in for a treat.

108
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,520
Girls!

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,840
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,040
Thanks for scaring away
my company

111
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,800
and drenching my workplace
in brains.

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Who are you?

113
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,880
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
We fought together
on Vanaheim.

115
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,640
Right. Where is Heimdall?

116
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,800
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

117
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,560
Traitor?

118
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

119
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
with negligence of duty...

120
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
but he disappeared
before the trial.

121
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Hard to catch a guy

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
who can see
everything in the universe.

123
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Sure.

124
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,520
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

125
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
What the hell is that?

126
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,920
MAN 1: Oh, brother.
This is it.

127
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I take my leave.

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
MAN 2: You fool,
you didn't listen!

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
MAN 1: I'm sorry.

130
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
Lady Sif, get help!

131
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Somebody, help!

132
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
MAN 1: Sorry
for all I've done.

133
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,240
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

134
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm sorry
I tried to rule Earth.

135
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,280
They'd be lucky to have you.

136
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

137
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
-I just couldn't help myself.
-I know.

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm a trickster.

139
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,640
So mischievous.

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,520
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

141
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,120
It was a wonderful joke.

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,440
'Twas indeed hilarious.

143
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,640
MAN 2: You are the savior
of Asgard.

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,960
-Tell my story.
-I will.

145
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
Build a statue for me.

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
We will build
a big statue for you.

147
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,160
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

148
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,280
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

149
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,120
I didn't do it for him.

150
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,960
I didn't do it for him.

151
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,840
No!

152
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,280
And so,
Loki died of his wounds...

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
giving his life for ours.

154
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,160
He fought back
those disgusting elves...

155
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,200
he brought peace to the realm.

156
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
Loki, my boy...

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
'twas many moons ago
I found you

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,160
on that
frostbitten battlefield.

159
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,360
On that day,
I did not yet see in you...

160
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Asgard's savior. No.

161
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,520
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle...

162
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,520
that melted
this old fool's heart.

163
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

164
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Father.

165
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
Oh, shit.

166
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Uh, my son, Thor,
has returned!

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,360
-Greetings, my boy.
-

168
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,040
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

169
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,360
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

170
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,360
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

171
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,840
THOR: Ah, indeed they should.

172
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
I like the statue.

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

174
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,600
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

175
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,720
Do you know what this is?

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

177
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

178
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,240
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

179
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
and destroy the whole planet.

180
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,040
Thank you, dear. Um...

181
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,760
So it's back to Midgard
for you, is it?

182
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Nope.

183
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,240
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

185
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
ODIN: That's just
a silly dream...

186
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,640
signs of an overactive
imagination.

187
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
THOR: Possibly.

188
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

189
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,280
And what do I find,

190
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,120
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,280
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

192
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
all while you, Odin,

193
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
the protector
of those Nine Realms...

194
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
eating grapes.

196
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,440
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

198
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

199
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Watching theater.

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,920
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,200
You're really gonna
make me do it?

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,640
Do what?

203
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
You know that
nothing will stop Mjolnir

204
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
as it returns to my hand.

205
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
Not even your face.

206
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

207
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,640
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

208
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,440
All right, I yield.

209
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Behold!

210
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,800
Thor...

211
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
-Odinson.
-No.

212
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,960
You had one job. Just the one.

213
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Where's Odin?

214
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

215
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
Everything was fine
without you.

216
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,880
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

217
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
-Ask them.
-Where's Father?

218
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
-Did you kill him?
-You had what you wanted.

219
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
You had the independence
you asked for.

220
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay. I know exactly
where he is.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,880
I swear I left him right here.

223
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
THOR: Right here
on the sidewalk,

224
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

225
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Great planning.

226
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
How was I supposed to know?

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,040
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

228
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,440
No? Then why do you dress
like one?

229
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,840
-Hey.
-I can't believe you're alive.

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,480
I saw you die.

231
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,200
I mourned you,
I cried for you.

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm honored.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
GIRL: Ask him.

234
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,680
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

235
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
-Oh, sure.
-

236
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,680
Start figuring out
where he is.

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,680
-GIRL: Oh, my God.

238
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
Sorry to hear
that Jane dumped you.

239
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,560
She didn't dump me, you know.

240
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

241
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,720
What's this?
What are you doing?

242
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
This isn't me.

243
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Loki.

244
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,760
Thor Odinson.

245
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,880
God of Thunder.

246
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
You can put down the umbrella.

247
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
So, Earth has, uh,
wizards now?

248
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,800
-

249
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
The preferred term is

250
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,320
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

251
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
All right, wizard.

252
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,360
Who are you?
Why should I care?

253
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
My name
is Doctor Stephen Strange,

254
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,760
and I have some questions
for you.

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,840
Take a seat.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Tea?

257
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I don't drink tea.

258
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
What do you drink?

259
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,680
Not tea.

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
So, I keep a watch list

261
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,640
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

262
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,520
that may be a threat
to this world.

263
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,200
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

264
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,840
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

265
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,240
Then why bring him here?

266
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,040
We're looking for my father.

267
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,600
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

268
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,240
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

269
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Promptly.

270
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,040
Great! Then I'll help you.

271
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,360
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

272
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,320
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

273
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
that he not be disturbed.

274
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,600
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

275
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,880
-Hmm.
-And you don't have a phone.

276
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,960
No, I don't have a phone...

277
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,880
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

278
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,040
It's called an email.

279
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,800
-Yeah, do you have a computer?
-No. What for?

280
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,040
-Uh-huh.
-Anyway,

281
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,720
my father
is no longer in exile.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,560
So if you could
tell me where he is,

283
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I can take him home.

284
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Gladly. He's in Norway.

285
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,840
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

286
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,880
requires any Asgardian
modifications.

287
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,640
Nope.

288
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Oh, we don't need that.

289
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Will you stop doing that?

290
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,040
I need just one strand
of your hair.

291
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Let me explain something.

292
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,880
My hair is not to be
meddled with.

293
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,880
We could have just walked.

294
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,440
He's waiting for you.

295
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
All right.

296
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,400
Don't forget your umbrella.

297
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Oh, yes.

298
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Sorry.

299
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
There we go.

300
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, yeah. Right.

302
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

303
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,400
You can handle him from here.

304
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Yes. Of course.

305
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,600
Thank you very much
for your help.

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Good luck.

307
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Handle me? Who are you?

308
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Loki.

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,040
LOKI: You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

310
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,800
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

311
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
Bye-bye.

312
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
Father?

313
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,840
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

314
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
Father, it's us.

315
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
My sons.

316
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
I've been waiting for you.

317
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,680
I know. We've come
to take you home.

318
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,640
Home, yes.

319
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Your mother, she calls me.

320
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Do you hear it?

321
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,840
Loki, lift your magic.

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,000
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

323
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,680
Frigga would have been proud.

324
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

325
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,840
I know that we failed you.

326
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
But we can make this right.

327
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,240
I failed you.

328
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,880
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

329
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,840
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

330
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
No.

331
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,200
It has already begun.
She's coming.

332
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
My life was all that
held her back.

333
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
But my time has come.

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,320
I cannot keep her away
any longer.

335
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Father, who are you
talking about?

336
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,920
Goddess of Death. Hela.

337
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,560
My firstborn.

338
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Your sister.

339
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
Your what?

340
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,760
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

341
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,120
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

342
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,280
Locked her away.

343
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
She draws her strength
from Asgard...

344
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,400
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

345
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

346
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
We can face her together.

347
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
No, we won't.

348
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm on a different path now.

349
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,240
This you must face alone.

350
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,360
I love you, my sons.

351
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Look at that.

352
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,320
Remember this place.

353
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
Home.

354
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Brother.

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
This was your doing.

356
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,400
So he's gone.

357
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,640
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

358
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
You must be Hela.

359
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

360
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,120
Really?
You don't look like him.

361
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,280
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

362
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
You sound like him.

363
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
Kneel.

364
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,920
Beg your pardon?

365
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Kneel.

366
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
Before your queen.

367
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,560
I don't think so.

368
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
It's not possible.

369
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

370
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Bring us back!

371
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
No!

372
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Loki!

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

374
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm Hela.

375
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm just a janitor.

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,040
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

377
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,800
How would you like a job?

378
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,720
Are you a fighter?

379
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Or are you food?

380
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm just passing through.

381
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,120
It is food.

382
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
On your knees.

383
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,200
-

384
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,560
-He's mine.

385
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Wait!

386
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Wait!

387
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
He's mine.

388
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,640
So if you want him,
you go through me.

389
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,280
But we've already got him.

390
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,880
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

391
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,920
-More food.

392
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,600
-Thank you.

393
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,440
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

394
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,680
I've got something special.

395
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,200
Hey! Where are you taking me?

396
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,840
Answer me!

397
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
Hey!

398
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,160
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

399
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,360
-Many apologies, your majesty.
-

400
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,680
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

401
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,360
I am Hela,
Odin's firstborn...

402
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,760
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

403
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,680
the rightful heir
to the throne,

404
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,240
and the Goddess of Death.

405
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,400
My father is dead.

406
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,520
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

407
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,600
We were once the seat

408
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,560
of absolute power
in the cosmos.

409
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,920
Our supremacy
was unchallenged.

410
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,160
Yet Odin stopped
at Nine Realms.

411
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,760
Our destiny is to rule over
all others.

412
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,720
And I am here
to restore that power.

413
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,880
Kneel before me...

414
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,960
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

415
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
Whoever you are...

416
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,400
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

417
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,800
Or we will show you no mercy.

418
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,440
Whoever I am?

419
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,120
Did you listen
to a word I said?

420
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,280
This is your last warning!

421
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,640
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

422
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,720
Fine.

423
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
SOLDIER: Charge!

424
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,640
Oh, I've missed this.

425
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,400
Still, it's a shame.

426
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,400
Good soldiers dying
for nothing...

427
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,680
all because
they couldn't see the future.

428
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,400
Sad.

429
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,560
-Oh, look, still alive.

430
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,840
Change of heart?

431
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,520
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

432
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,240
You evil demoness!

433
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,240
HELA: Let's go see my palace.

434
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,440
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Fear not, for you are found.

435
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
You are home,
and there is no going back.

436
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,920
No one leaves this place.

437
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,800
But what is this place?

438
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,080
The answer is Sakaar.

439
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,200
Surrounded
by cosmic gateways...

440
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,120
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.

441
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,080
It is the collection point

442
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,800
for all lost
and unloved things...

443
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,800
like you.

444
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,640
But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.

445
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
You are valuable.

446
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,080
Here you are loved.

447
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
What the hell?

448
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,320
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.

449
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,520
He is the original,

450
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
the first lost
and the first found...

451
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,000
the creator of Sakaar...

452
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,320
and father
of the Contest of Champions.

453
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,840
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.

454
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,160
You are the property
of the Grandmaster.

455
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,920
Congratulations!

456
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,520
You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.

457
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,160
Prepare yourself.

458
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,280
Prepare yourself.

459
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.

460
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,520
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

461
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,360
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

462
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
It is a he.

463
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Yeah.

464
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,120
I love when you come
to visit, 142.

465
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,760
You bring me the best stuff.

466
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,880
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

467
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,680
about Scrapper 142...

468
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,200
what do I always say?

469
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,280
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

470
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Trash.

471
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,200
No, not trash.

472
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,680
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

473
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,120
It doesn't start with a "B."

474
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Booze hag.

475
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

476
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,760
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

477
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,960
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

478
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,960
You say that every time
she's here.

479
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

480
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
A contender.

481
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,880
A what?

482
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,160
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

483
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

484
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Pay this lady.

485
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,640
Just wait a damn minute.

486
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm not for sale.

487
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,200
Man, he's a fighter.

488
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,600
I take 10 million.

489
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Tell her she's dreaming.

490
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

491
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,560
You'll pay for this.

492
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,120
No, I got paid for this.

493
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,520
-Here's what I wanna know.
-

494
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Who are you?

495
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,360
I am the God of Thunder.

496
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,840
-Wow.

497
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,960
I didn't hear any thunder,

498
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,080
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

499
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,640
We've located your cousin.

500
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
Uh, oh, good!

501
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

502
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
There he is.

503
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,480
Hey, cuz.

504
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,320
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

505
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,800
Hi.

506
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,320
-GRANDMASTER: Hmm.

507
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,480
So...

508
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Please.

509
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,320
Yeah.

511
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
Carlo...

512
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,000
I pardon you.

513
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,560
Oh, thank you.

514
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Thank you.

515
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,840
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

516
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,880
-

517
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
Help me.

518
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,160
Oh, my God!

519
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,520
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

520
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,520
Wow.

521
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,480
Oh, the smell.

522
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
What does it smell like?

523
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,520
-Burnt toast.
-

524
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,360
What happened to my manners?

525
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,160
I haven't
properly introduced myself.

526
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,200
Come on. Uh, follow me.

527
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,640
-My name is Grandmaster.

528
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,640
I preside over
a little harlequinade

529
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,160
called
the Contest of Champions.

530
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,840
People come from far and wide

531
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
to unwillingly
participate in it.

532
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
And you, my friend,

533
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,040
might just be part
of the new cast.

534
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,280
What do you say to that?

535
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

536
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
I'm going back to Asgard.

537
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,280
-Ass-gard.
-

538
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
One, two, three, four.

539
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,840
LOKI: There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

540
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,160
At that moment,
I let go.

541
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,400
Loki?

542
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,480
Loki! Loki!

543
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,920
-Over here. Over here.
-

544
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,400
-Excuse me one second.
-Loki!

545
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,360
-

546
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,560
-What?
-You're alive?

547
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,360
-Yes, of course I'm alive.
-What are you doing here?

548
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

549
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

550
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

551
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,720
-Get me out of this one.
-I can't.

552
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,200
-Get me out. What?
-I can't.

553
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
I've made friends
with this man.

554
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
He's called the Grandmaster.

555
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,560
-Oh, he's crazy!
-I've gained his favor.

556
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,280
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

557
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

558
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I just got here.

559
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
What are you
whispering about?

560
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Time works real different
around these parts.

561
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,200
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

562
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
But here on Sakaar...

563
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,080
In any case,
you know this, uh...

564
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,520
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

565
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,920
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

566
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,840
I've never met this man
in my life.

567
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,600
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

568
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,760
Is he any kind of a fighter?

569
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,240
You take this thing

570
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

571
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,120
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

572
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,280
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

573
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,600
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

574
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,960
Asgard.

575
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

576
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,800
their freedom they shall win.

577
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,640
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

578
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,160
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

579
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,960
That's what I call, contender.

580
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

581
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,120
Ah! Loki!

582
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

583
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
-Over here.

584
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,480
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

585
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

586
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,000
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

587
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

588
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

589
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,000
But don't let that
intimidate you.

590
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,480
You don't need to be afraid

591
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,120
unless you're
made of scissors.

592
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

593
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
joke for you.

594
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,480
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

595
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,360
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

596
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,440
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

597
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,280
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

598
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

599
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

600
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,000
So hardly anyone turned up,

601
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,680
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

602
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,360
As punishment, I was forced

603
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,800
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

604
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,320
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

605
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,200
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

606
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
I don't know
if you'd be interested

607
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,640
in something like that.

608
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,360
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

609
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
How did you...

610
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

611
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

612
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,360
This doesn't make any sense.

613
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

614
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,360
The only thing
that does make sense

615
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,840
is that nothing makes sense.

616
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,360
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

617
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Doug has.

618
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Doug!

619
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Our luck, Doug's dead.

620
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
That's right.

621
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,360
Everyone who fights

622
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

623
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,560
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

624
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,400
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

625
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,440
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

626
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,400
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

627
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

628
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,880
Yes, I am.

629
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,960
Gonna fight him, win,

630
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,360
and get the hell out
of this place.

631
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,840
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

632
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
See you later, new Doug.

633
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,400
Does no one remember me?

634
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,440
Has no one been taught
our history?

635
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,600
Look at these lies.

636
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,760
Goblets and garden parties?

637
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,720
Peace treaties?

638
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,760
Odin...

639
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,480
proud to have it...

640
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,040
ashamed of how he got it.

641
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,600
We were unstoppable.

642
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,640
I was his weapon
in the conquest

643
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,120
that built Asgard's empire.

644
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,280
One by one,
the realms became ours.

645
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,640
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

646
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,480
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

647
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,520
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

648
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,320
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

649
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,280
-Odin's treasures.
-Fake.

650
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,000
Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

651
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,800
Or weak.

652
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

653
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,520
That's not bad.

654
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,320
But this...

655
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The Eternal Flame.

656
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,600
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

657
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,080
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

658
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,600
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

659
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,080
I've missed you.

660
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,800
I've missed you all.

661
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
THOR: Odin...

662
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,120
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

663
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,640
where the brave
shall live forever.

664
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,440
Nor shall we mourn
but rejoice...

665
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,120
for those that have died...

666
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,440
THOR AND LOKI:
...the glorious death.

667
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,840
Hurts, doesn't it?

668
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
Being lied to.

669
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,560
Being told you're one thing

670
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,480
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

671
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,320
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

672
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,280
This place is disgusting.

673
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

674
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,160
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

675
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,680
It took me time
to win his trust.

676
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,280
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

677
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,840
What I'm telling you is,

678
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,640
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

679
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
Perhaps, in time,

680
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,480
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

681
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,880
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

682
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,040
Our sister destroyed
your hammer

683
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,520
like a piece of glass.

684
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,320
She's stronger than both of
us. She's stronger than you.

685
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,800
You don't stand a chance.

686
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,160
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

687
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Fine.

688
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,840
I guess
I'll just have to go it alone.

689
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Like I've always done.

690
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,040
Would you say something?

691
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,280
Say something!

692
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,640
What would you like me to say?

693
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,200
You faked your own death...

694
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,000
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

695
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,720
stranded him on Earth to die,

696
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,360
releasing
the Goddess of Death.

697
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,200
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

698
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,200
further than the past
two days?

699
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,320
You know, I haven't seen this

700
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
beloved champion
he talks of...

701
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,560
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

702
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,920
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

703
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Don't let me down.

704
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,760
KORG: Piss off, ghost!

705
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,880
He's freaking gone.

706
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
KORG: Oh, yuck!

707
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,520
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

708
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,080
Guys, can you clean up
the weapons

709
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,400
once you finish your fight?

710
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,560
Disgusting slobs.

711
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, Thor...

712
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,520
wanna use a big wooden fork?

713
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
No.

714
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,120
Yeah, not really useful.

715
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,120
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires

716
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,760
that were huddled together.

717
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,240
I really wish I had my hammer.

718
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Hammer?

719
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,320
Quite unique.
It was made from this

720
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,400
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

721
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,440
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

722
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,000
it gave me the ability to fly.

723
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
You rode a hammer?

724
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,800
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

725
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,440
The hammer rode you
on your back?

726
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,240
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

727
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,920
and it would pull me
off the...

728
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,080
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

729
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,920
The ground. It would pull me
off the ground,

730
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,800
up into the air,
and I would fly.

731
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Every time I threw it,

732
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,960
it would always
come back to me.

733
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,480
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

734
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,920
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

735
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,120
and that losing it

736
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,960
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

737
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,160
That's a nice way
of putting it.

738
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,120
I said they're mine.

739
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,560
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

740
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,120
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

741
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,320
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

742
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,000
They are hard to perish.

743
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
Asgardian?

744
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,280
Hey. Hey.

745
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Hey.

746
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,000
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

747
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,120
Asgard is in danger.

748
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,040
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

749
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,360
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

750
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,000
until I found out that
you were all women.

751
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

752
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,240
I love women.

753
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,840
Sometimes a little too much.

754
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,120
Not in a creepy way,

755
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,920
just more
of a respectful appreciation.

756
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,480
I think it's great
that there is

757
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,600
an elite force
of women warriors.

758
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,240
It's about time.

759
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,840
Are you done?

760
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
WARDEN: Lord of Thunder,
you're up.

761
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,160
Please, help me.
I need your help.

762
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Bye.

763
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,480
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

764
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,040
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

765
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,840
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

766
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,040
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

767
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,240
-

768
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,200
Bring him in for processing.

769
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,360
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

770
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,720
BARBER: Now, don't you move.

771
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,560
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

772
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,640
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

773
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,400
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

774
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,200
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

775
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,880
Please! No!

776
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,080
No!

777
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,200
Wow! Look at
all of you.

778
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,920
What a show! What a night!

779
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Who's having fun?

780
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,920
Please, I'm your host.

781
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,400
Big round of applause

782
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,320
for all of our
undercard competitors...

783
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,280
who today died so gruesomely.

784
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,640
Good sports.

785
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,480
What a show! What a night!

786
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,880
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.

787
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,760
And now,
without further ado...

788
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,280
it's main event time.

789
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,680
Making his first appearance,

790
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,280
though he looks
quite promising...

791
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,480
got a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.

792
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,480
I'll say no more,
see what you think.

793
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

794
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,480
Lord of Thunder.

795
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.

796
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,320
Okay, this is it.

797
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,800
Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.

798
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,840
-

799
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,200
GRANDMASTER: He is a creature.

800
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,680
What can we say about him?

801
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,280
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.

802
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,960
I feel a special connection
with him.

803
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,960
He's undefeated.

804
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,800
He's the reigning.

805
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,280
He's the defending.

806
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
Ladies and gentlemen...

807
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
I give you...

808
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,520
Uh-oh.

809
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,720
...your Incredible...

810
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,400
Hulk!

811
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,400
Yes!

812
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,200
I have to get off this planet.

813
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,680
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

814
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,240
-

815
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,200
Hey!

816
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,080
We know each other.

817
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,400
He's a friend from work.

818
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,360
Where have you been?

819
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Everybody thought
you were dead.

820
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,640
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

821
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,800
I lost my hammer.

822
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,920
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

823
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,640
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

824
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,960
He's up there.

825
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,120
Loki! Look who it is!

826
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

827
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,720
but I'm happy to see you.

828
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,400
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

829
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
THOR: Banner.

830
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,560
Hey, Banner!

831
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
No Banner. Only Hulk.

832
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,680
What are you doing?

833
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,640
-It's me. It's Thor!
-

834
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,320
Banner, we're friends.

835
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,400
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

836
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,320
-Here we go.

837
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,320
What?

838
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,200
Hey, big guy.

839
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,040
The sun's getting real low.

840
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,720
That's it.
The sun's going down.

841
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,400
I won't hurt you anymore.

842
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,040
No one will.

843
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Yes! That's how it feels!

844
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,400
I'm just a huge fan
of the sport.

845
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,520
All right. Screw it.

846
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,720
AUDIENCE: Oh!

847
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,400
I know
you're in there, Banner.

848
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,440
I'll get you out!

849
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,680
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

850
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,080
I told them we were friends!

851
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,360
-

852
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,360
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

853
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,000
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

854
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,240
Another day, another Doug.

855
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,400
HELA: What is that noise?

856
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,360
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

857
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,440
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

858
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,760
Tell me about yourself,
Skurge.

859
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,440
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

860
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,600
Right, yeah,
I'll just stop you there.

861
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,440
What I meant was...

862
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,280
what's your ambition?

863
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,760
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

864
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,560
Recognition.

865
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,200
When I was young...

866
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,120
every great king
had an executioner.

867
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,280
Not just to execute people...

868
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,080
but also
to execute their vision.

869
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,880
But mainly to execute people.

870
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,080
Still, it was a great honor.

871
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,640
I was Odin's executioner.

872
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,960
And you shall be
my executioner.

873
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,480
Let's begin our conquest.

874
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,440
Skurge, where's the sword?

875
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,520
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

876
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,520
Those people you mentioned,

877
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,640
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

878
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,360
round them up.

879
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,680
Excuse me.

880
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,200
Sorry about that.

881
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,600
These bloody things
are everywhere.

882
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,040
Come on.

883
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,600
You'll be safe here.

884
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,240
-

885
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
Are we cool?

886
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,400
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

887
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,280
So how long
have you been like that?

888
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,000
Like what?

889
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,880
Like this. Big, and green,
and stupid.

890
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,160
Hulk always Hulk.

891
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,360
How'd you get here?

892
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
Winning.

893
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,960
You mean cheating, huh?

894
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,360
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

895
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,800
How'd you arrive here?

896
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Quinjet.

897
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,520
Yes. Now,
where is the Quinjet now?

898
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,360
That's naked.

899
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,200
-He's very naked. Hmm.
-

900
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,040
It's in my brain now.

901
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
Quinjet.

902
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,880
Yes!

903
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,520
I'm getting us out of here.

904
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,120
This is a terrible,
awful place.

905
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,040
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

906
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,560
Hulk stay.

907
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,080
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

908
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,640
We must prevent Ragnarok.

909
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,080
Ragnarok?

910
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,920
The prophesied death
of my home world.

911
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,360
The end of days,
it's the end of...

912
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
If you help me
get back to Asgard...

913
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,960
I can help you
get back to Earth. Huh?

914
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Earth hate Hulk.

915
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,920
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

916
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,520
You're one of the Avengers.

917
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,760
One of the team,
one of our friends.

918
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,240
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

919
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,600
You're Banner's friend.

920
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,920
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

921
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,280
Banner's friend.

922
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
-I don't even like Banner.
-

923
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,280
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

924
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,280
Thor go. Hulk stay.

925
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,680
Fine.

926
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,280
Stay here.

927
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,440
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

928
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,120
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

929
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,120
Smash you.

930
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,600
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

931
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,920
-I smashed you.
-Yeah, sure, sure.

932
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,800
-Baby arms.
-What?

933
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,280
Baby.

934
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,800
Moron! You big child.

935
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,120
Thor go!

936
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,960
-I am going.
-

937
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,120
-

938
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,360
Thor go again.

939
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,440
Thor home.

940
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,960
Hulk trains.

941
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,280
That's great. Have fun.

942
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,160
-Hey, big guy.
-Angry girl.

943
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,480
What have you been up to?

944
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,840
HULK: Winning.

945
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,360
Heimdall, I know
you can see me.

946
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,520
I need you to help me.

947
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Help me see.

948
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,840
I see you,
but you're far away.

949
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,960
What's going on here?

950
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,600
Come see for yourself.

951
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,800
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

952
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,880
built by our ancestors.

953
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,680
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

954
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,880
You're talking
about evacuating Asgard?

955
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,960
We won't last long if we stay.

956
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,960
She draws her power
from Asgard

957
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,160
and grows stronger every day.

958
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,440
Come on.

959
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,880
Hela is ravenous.

960
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,240
If I let her leave,

961
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,040
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

962
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
We need you.

963
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,560
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

964
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,680
where the hell I am.

965
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,240
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

966
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,360
-Which one?
-The big one.

967
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,600
Thor sad.

968
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,080
Shut up.

969
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,920
Thor sad.

970
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,840
I'm not sad, you idiot.

971
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,920
-I'm pissed off!
-Oh.

972
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,600
Angry. I lost my father.

973
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,280
-I lost my hammer.
-

974
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,040
-You're not even listening.
-Whining and crying.

975
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,280
Cry like baby.

976
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,120
Don't kick stuff.

977
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,640
You're being
a really bad friend.

978
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
You bad friend!

979
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,320
-You know what we call you?
-No.

980
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,240
We call you
the stupid Avenger.

981
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,240
What, are you crazy?

982
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,480
Yes.

983
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,960
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

984
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,760
No. Mmm-mmm.

985
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,840
I'm sorry I said those things.

986
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,960
You're not the stupid Avenger.

987
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,080
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

988
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,160
It's okay.

989
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,560
You just can't go around
throwing shields

990
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,800
at people.
Could have killed me.

991
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,080
I know. I'm sorry.

992
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,840
I just get so angry
all the time.

993
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,960
Hulk always, always angry.

994
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,520
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

995
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,560
We're just
a couple of hot-headed fools.

996
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,640
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

997
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,360
We're kind of both like fire.

998
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,520
But Hulk like real fire.

999
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,960
Hulk like raging fire.

1000
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,320
Thor like smoldering fire.

1001
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,720
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

1002
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
Hmm?

1003
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,720
Angry girl.

1004
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,320
What's going on?
What are you...

1005
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,240
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

1006
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,840
when someone's hiding
all the way across

1007
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,240
the universe and wants
to be left alone.

1008
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,040
-We need to talk.
-No, you wanna talk to me.

1009
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,920
I need her to stay.

1010
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,080
Stay?

1011
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,760
Block.

1012
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,160
Stay.

1013
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,800
-Please.
-Please.

1014
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,560
All right.

1015
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,640
-Here's the deal.
-

1016
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,920
I'll listen to you...

1017
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,960
till this is empty.

1018
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,760
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

1019
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,440
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1020
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,920
Wow.

1021
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,440
-Finished. Bye.
-

1022
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,440
Odin is dead.

1023
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,080
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1024
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,440
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1025
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,000
I'm going to stop her.

1026
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
-Alone?
-Nope.

1027
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,440
I'm putting together a team.

1028
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,440
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1029
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,000
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1030
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,800
It's me and you.

1031
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
I think it's only you.

1032
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,560
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1033
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,000
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1034
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'm not getting dragged into

1035
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

1036
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,480
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your sister.

1037
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,600
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1038
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,960
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

1039
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,280
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

1040
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,840
and tried to seize the throne.

1041
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,840
When she tried
to escape her banishment...

1042
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,280
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1043
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
I only survived because...

1044
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,000
Look, I already faced her once

1045
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,840
back when I believed
in the throne...

1046
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,160
and it cost me everything.

1047
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,000
That's what's wrong
with Asgard.

1048
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,480
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1049
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,000
I agree.

1050
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,320
Don't get familiar.

1051
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,160
I agree.

1052
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,840
That's why I turned down
the throne.

1053
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,000
But this isn't
about the crown.

1054
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,160
This is about the people.

1055
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,280
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

1056
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,880
Forget it.

1057
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,320
I have.

1058
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,640
-Okay.
-Okay.

1059
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,960
-Good. Great.
-Great.

1060
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,160
Thank you.

1061
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,840
-For what?
-For this.

1062
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,360
Didn't see that,
did you?

1063
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,960
-There... That's better.

1064
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,520
You know, go ahead.

1065
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,200
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1066
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,720
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1067
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,160
But me...

1068
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,040
I choose to run
toward my problems

1069
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,280
and not away from them.

1070
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,680
Because that's what...

1071
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,760
Because that's what heroes do.

1072
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,720
Friend stay!

1073
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,920
Yes!

1074
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,560
All right.

1075
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,560

No, no, no! Stop!

01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,160
-Stay!
-

1094
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,800
Stop!
Stop breaking everything!

1095
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,440
Don't go!

1096
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,000
Nice work, big guy.

1097
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,560
We don't know
where Ultron's headed,

1098
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,640
but you're going very high,
very fast.

1099
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,440
So, I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

1100
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,640
We can't track you
in stealth mode...

1101
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,600
so I need you
to help me out. Okay?

1102
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,840
I need you to...

1103
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,320
No! No, Banner!

1104
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,040
Oh, jeez.

1105
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,520
Banner.

1106
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,200
-Hey, hey, hey.
-

1107
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,800
-You all right, Banner?
-

1108
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,200
-

1109
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,160
Sun's going down.
Sun's going down.

1110
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,000
That's it, breathe.

1111
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,520
I won't hurt you.

1112
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
-Sun's going down.
-

1113
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,000
-Thor.
-Yeah.

1114
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,200
What happened to your hair?

1115
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,720
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

1116
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,240
-It looks good.
-Oh, thanks.

1117
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,720
Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1118
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,880
-Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
-Is she okay?

1119
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,880
-And what about Sokovia?
-Sokovia?

1120
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,560
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1121
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,880
-Banner, listen.
-What?

1122
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,040
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1123
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,720
-What are you saying?
-Well...

1124
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
What?

1125
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,200
I've been Hulk for two years?

1126
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,880
I'm afraid so.

1127
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,120
What the hell happened?

1128
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,240
Banner, there's something
you should know.

Uh, what?

Ship's log.

1134
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,000
Thor, where are we?

1135
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,240
Yeah, about that.

1136
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,720
Sakaar, hear ye.

1137
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,480
Attention please.
I have some bad news.

1138
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,440
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1139
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,880
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

1140
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,920
BANNER: Who's that?

1141
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,760
He kind of runs the place.

1142
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,920
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1143
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,080
-I did?
-Yeah.

1144
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,200
Quite a lot's happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

1145
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,640
-Did I win?
-No, I won. Easily.

1146
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,120
Doesn't sound right.

1147
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,240
Well, it's true.

1148
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,320
It seems that that
criminally seductive

1149
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,800
Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.

1150
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,440
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1151
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,400
Oh, no.

1152
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,320
This is bad.

1153
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,400
This is really, really bad.

1154
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,800
Thor, I think
I'm freaking out.

1155
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,440
No, no, no.

1156
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,440
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1157
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,680
These are Tony's clothes.

1158
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,120
-I know, come on.
-Is he here?

1159
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,160
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1160
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,480
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1161
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
Sun's going down.

1162
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,160
GRANDMASTER: I'm upset!

1163
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,000
I'm very upset.

1164
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,160
You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1165
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,640
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1166
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,680
And you know who I'm blaming?

1167
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,480
-Grandmaster, I can...
-Hey!

1168
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Don't interrupt me!

1169
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Here you go.

1170
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,960
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1171
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,920
He was interrupting.

1172
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,960
That's not
a capital violation.

1173
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,400
Where was I?

1174
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,320
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1175
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,520
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1176
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,800
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1177
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,960
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1178
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1179
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
And your contender...

1180
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
LOKI: My dear friend...

1181
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,200
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1182
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,680
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1183
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,360
I could do it in two.

1184
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,360
I could do it in one.

1185
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,560
Let's stop there.

1186
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,520
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1187
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,320
thinking about
a public execution.

1188
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,360
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1189
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,360
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1190
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,000
So, you're on the clock.

1191
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,040
What have you done?

1192
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,400
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1193
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,560
It's Loki.

1194
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,200
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1195
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,240
-Hmm.

1196
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,240
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1197
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,720
I don't help anyone.

1198
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
You're a Valkyrie.

1199
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,520
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1200
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,400
Choose your next words wisely.

1201
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,880
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1202
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,120
THOR: The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1203
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,680
The sun's going down.

1204
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,240
-It's getting real low.
-Oh, shoot.

1205
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,800
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

1206
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,960
I just need you to stay calm.

1207
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,000
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1208
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,960
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1209
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,040
Yeah. One.

1210
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,960
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1211
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,320
It's a new experience.

1212
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,480
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1213
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,560
than my brain can handle
the information.

1214
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,000
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1215
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,000
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1216
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,320
each had a hand on the wheel.

1217
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,400
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1218
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,000
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1219
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,040
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1220
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,320
No, it's not what matters.

1221
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,600
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1222
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,160
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1223
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,840
Banner may never come back.

1224
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,360
And we're stranded on a planet

1225
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,160
that is designed
to stress me out.

1226
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,360
We're not stranded.

1227
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,800
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1228
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Thank you.

1229
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,680
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1230
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,000
What?

1231
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,840
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1232
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,640
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1233
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,640
who also happens
to be my sister.

1234
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,520
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1235
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,880
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1236
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,200
That's a family issue.

1237
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,520
No, she's an evil being.

1238
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,440
I don't care what she is.

1239
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,720
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1240
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,920
-What?
-I just told you.

1241
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,760
If I turn into the Hulk,

1242
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,040
I am never gonna
come back again.

1243
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,280
And you don't care.

1244
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,160
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1245
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,680
The Hulk is the fire.

1246
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,640
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1247
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,280
-What? No!
-It's gross.

1248
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,200
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1249
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,200
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1250
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,560
He's all like...

1251
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,080
"Smash, smash, smash."

1252
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,400
I prefer you.

1253
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Thanks.

1254
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,680
But if I'm being honest,

1255
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,120
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1256
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,680
he is very powerful
and useful.

1257
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,760
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1258
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,200
Is he though?

1259
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1260
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,400
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1261
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,240
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1262
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,280
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1263
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,480
What are you doing with that?

1264
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,680
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1265
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,440
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

1266
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,760
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

1267
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,720
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1268
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,440
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1269
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,880
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1270
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,080
Because you were naked.

1271
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,440
Okay, I'll give you that.

1272
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,560
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1273
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,960
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1274
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,120
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry.

1275
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,440
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

1276
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,920
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1277
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,600
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1278
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,520
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1279
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,080
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

1280
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,600
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

1281
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,880
and you're not gonna
have to think about

1282
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,960
the Hulk ever again.

1283
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,280
-All right?
-All right.

1284
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,080
-

1285
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,000
Hulk!

1286
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,600
Oh. This is bad.

1287
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,080
Banner! Banner!

1288
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,160
Banner!

1289
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,920
Banner!

1290
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,560
Thor!

1291
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,840
Hi.

1292
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,160
Hi.

1293
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,680
I was gonna do that.

1294
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,840
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1295
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,000
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1296
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,680
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1297
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,840
I got sidetracked.

1298
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,360
What's with the...

1299
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,920
It's my disguise.

1300
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,040
But I can see your face.

1301
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,200
Not when I do this, you can't.

1302
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,680
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1303
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,200
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1304
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,680
BANNER: What are those things
on her eyes?

1305
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,080
Are those the people
that she's killed?

1306
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,840
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1307
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,080
Who is this guy?

1308
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,200
-He's a friend.
-Who? Me?

1309
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,600
-I'm Bruce.
-I feel like I know you.

1310
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,800
I feel like I know you, too.

1311
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,320
Look, I've spent years
in a haze,

1312
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,800
-trying to forget my past.
-THOR: Mmm.

1313
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,640
Sakaar seemed like
the best place

1314
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,960
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

1315
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,960
I was thinking
that you drink too much,

1316
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,400
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

1317
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,680
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1318
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,040
-Oh.
-But I don't wanna forget.

1319
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,840
I can't turn away anymore...

1320
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,240
so if I'm gonna die...

1321
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,120
well, it may as well be
driving my sword

1322
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,560
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

1323
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,360
-Good.
-BANNER: Yeah.

1324
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,520
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

1325
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,400
Has it got a name?

1326
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,280
Yeah, it's called
the Revengers.

1327
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,680
Revengers?

1328
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,160
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1329
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,280
Do you want revenge?

1330
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,600
I'm undecided.

1331
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
Okay.

1332
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,240
Also, I've got
a peace offering.

1333
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,440
Surprise.

1334
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,440
Ow.

1335
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,880
Just had to be sure.

1336
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,640
Hello, Bruce.

1337
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,880
So, last time I saw you,

1338
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,080
you were trying
to kill everybody.

1339
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,440
Where are you at these days?

1340
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,760
It varies
from moment to moment.

1341
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,040
THOR: Is that a Dragonfang?

1342
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,800
It is.

1343
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,920
THOR: My God.

1344
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,960
This is the famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

1345
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,880
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

1346
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,120
as any two known systems.

1347
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,120
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1348
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,440
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

1349
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,960
in 18 months.

1350
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,360
Nope. We are going through
the big one.

1351
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,640
The Devil's Anus?

1352
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:39,960
Anus?

1353
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,120
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1354
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,360
For the record, I didn't know

1355
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,480
it was called that
when I picked it.

1356
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,160
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star...

1357
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,640
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1358
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,240
We need another ship.

1359
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,680
That would tear
mine to pieces.

1360
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,520
THOR: She's right. We need one
that can withstand

1361
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,680
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1362
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,840
And has an offline
power steering system...

1363
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,520
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1364
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,160
And we need one
with cup holders,

1365
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,800
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

1366
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,960
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1367
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,960
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1368
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,160
THOR: What do you say?

1369
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,480
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1370
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,840
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

1371
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,240
Talk about an adventure.

1372
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,520
-We need a ship.
-Need a ship.

1373
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,800
There are one or two ships.

1374
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,840
Absolute top of the line
models...

1375
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,360
I don't mean to impose...

1376
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,360
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1377
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,400
I may even have stolen

1378
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,480
the access codes
to his security system.

1379
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,720
And suddenly you're overcome

1380
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,920
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1381
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Heavens, no.

1382
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,920
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1383
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,840
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1384
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,200
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1385
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,880
You're telling us
that you can get us

1386
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,120
access into the garage...

1387
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,840
without setting off
any alarms?

1388
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,840
Yes, brother. I can.

1389
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,720
A quick FYI.

1390
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,600
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1391
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,200
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1392
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,560
He did try to kill me.

1393
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,560
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1394
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,320
There was one time
when we were children...

1395
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,040
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1396
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,200
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1397
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,200
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1398
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,880
and he transformed back
into himself

1399
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,160
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1400
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,240
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1401
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,880
VALKYRIE: If we're
boosting a ship...

1402
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,600
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1403
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,200
Why not set the beast loose?

1404
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,400
Shut up.

1405
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,600
You guys have a beast?

1406
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,160
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1407
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,880
We're going to start
a revolution.

1408
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,400
-Revolution?
-I'll explain later.

1409
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,160
-Who's this guy again?
-I'll explain later.

1410
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,480
Is that
some sort of protoplasm,

1411
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,720
all the stuff
that's coming out of you...

1412
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,040
or are they eggs?

1413
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,640
Looks like eggs.

1414
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,080
-Oh!
-

1415
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,440
I'm looking for Korg.

1416
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:43,920
Who's asking?

1417
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,280
I know you're asking.

1418
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,440
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1419
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,760
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

1420
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,440
The revolution has begun.

1421
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,640
Revolution?
How did this happen?

1422
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,400
Don't know.

1423
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,080
But the arena's mainframe

1424
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,720
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

1425
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,920
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

1426
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,000
Oh. I don't like that word.

1427
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,440
Which? Mainframe?

1428
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,760
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

1429
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,960
No, the "S" word.

1430
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,760
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1431
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,480
Okay, that's better.

1432
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,480
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

1433
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,960
I disagree.

1434
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,320
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1435
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,640
You have no idea.

1436
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,440
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1437
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,480
Hello.

1438
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,600
Hi.

1439
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,240
Odin brought us together.

1440
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,120
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1441
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,240
We might as well be
strangers now.

1442
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,480
Two sons of the crown,
set adrift.

1443
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,680
-Oh.
-

1444
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,160
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

1445
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,640
Here's the thing.

1446
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,680
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1447
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,520
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1448
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,840
Did you just agree with me?

1449
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,600
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

1450
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,480
It's savage,
chaotic, lawless...

1451
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,280
Brother, you're gonna do
great here.

1452
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,080
Do you truly think
so little of me?

1453
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,000
Loki, I thought
the world of you.

1454
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,680
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1455
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,680
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1456
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,840
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1457
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,200
But let's be honest,

1458
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,520
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

1459
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,320
Yeah.

1460
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,560
It's probably for the best

1461
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,720
that we never
see each other again.

1462
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,120
That's what you always wanted.

1463
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,120
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1464
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,400
-What?
-"Get Help."

1465
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,480
No.

1466
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,560
-Come on, you love it.
-I hate it.

1467
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,640
It's great.
It works every time.

1468
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,360
-It's humiliating.
-Do you have a better plan?

1469
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,960
-No.
-We're doing it.

1470
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,840
We are not doing "Get Help."

1471
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,080
-Get help! Please!

1472
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,360
My brother, he's dying.

1473
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,480
Get help! Help him!

1474
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,760
Classic.

1475
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,240
Still hate it.

1476
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,760
-It's humiliating.
-Not for me, it's not.

1477
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,040
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1478
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,080
The Commodore.

1479
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
THOR: Right.

1480
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,280
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1481
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,240
Oh, Loki.

1482
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,720
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

1483
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,520
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1484
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,600
The reward for your capture

1485
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,760
-will set me up nicely.
-

1486
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,520
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

1487
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,120
Easier to let it burn.

1488
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,440
I agree.

1489
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,640
Oh, that looks painful.

1490
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,120
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1491
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,280
I trust you, you betray me.

1492
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,560
Round and round
in circles we go.

1493
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,720
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1494
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,120
It's about change.

1495
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,320
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1496
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,640
I guess
what I'm trying to say...

1497
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,760
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1498
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,360
but you could be more.

1499
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,960
I'll just put this over here
for you.

1500
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,920
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1501
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,600
All right,
I can figure this out.

1502
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,840
It's just another spaceship.

1503
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,520
Loyal Sakaarians...

1504
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,680
Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship

1505
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,160
and my favorite champion.

1506
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,840
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.

1507
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,680
Do not let him
leave this planet.

1508
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,160
-Good shot!
-Thanks.

1509
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,200
Open the doors.

1510
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,640
Okay.

1511
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,720
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1512
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,960
Why?

1513
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,840
-

1514
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,240
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

1515
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,280
Yes, we should.

1516
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,400
Where are the guns
on this ship?

1517
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,000
VALKYRIE: There aren't any.

1518
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,680
-It's a leisure vessel.
-BANNER: What?

1519
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,440
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

1520
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,560
orgies and stuff.

1521
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,240
Did she just say
the Grandmaster

1522
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,440
uses it for orgies?

1523
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,880
Yeah.

1524
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,400
Don't touch anything.

1525
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,080
No!

1526
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,120
-No!
-No!

1527
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,200
Get inside!

1528
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,920
In a minute.

1529
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,120
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1530
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,640
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1531
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,640
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1532
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,960
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1533
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,720
Okay, come on.

1534
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
There's gotta be a gun
on this thing.

1535
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That looks like a gun.

1536
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,640
It's my birthday

1537
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,720
It's my birthday

1538
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,680
It's my birthday

1539
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,840
Yeah!

1540
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,000
-

1541
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,520
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1542
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,280
There she is.

1543
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,400
Our ticket out of here.

1544
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,200
Hey, what's this?

1545
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,680
-

1546
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,400
Thank you.

1547
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,000
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1548
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,080
You wanna come?

1549
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,080
You do seem like

1550
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,600
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

1551
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,440
Why, thank you.

1552
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,360
Here we go.

1553
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,920
Shit.

1554
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,200
SKURGE: Asgardians...

1555
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,800
some misguided soul...

1556
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,640
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1557
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,240
Tell us where it is...

1558
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,000
or there will be consequences.

1559
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,960
Bad ones.

1560
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,280
Well?

1561
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,480
You.

1562
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,680
Well? Executioner?

1563
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,880
-MAN: Wait!

1564
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Wait!

1565
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,520
I know where the sword is.

1566
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,920
I never thought
I'd be back here.

1567
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,080
BANNER: I thought
it'd be a lot nicer.

1568
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,080
I mean,
not that it's not nice.

1569
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,560
It's just, it's on fire.

1570
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,760
Here, up here
in the mountains.

1571
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,360
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1572
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,520
She's coming for them.

1573
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,840
Okay, drop me off
at the palace

1574
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,040
-and I'll draw her away.
-And get yourself killed?

1575
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,920
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1576
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,280
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

1577
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,480
to help get
everyone off Asgard.

1578
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,600
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

1579
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,760
I have a man on the ground.

1580
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,680
Asgard.

1581
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,440
She's here.

1582
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,760
Now the ship has a gun.

1583
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,120
I'll take it from here.

1584
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,960
I found this in the armory.

1585
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,280
Good luck.

1586
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,160
Your Majesty...

1587
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,280
don't die.

1588
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,960
You know what I mean.

1589
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,760
HEIMDALL: We must keep moving!

1590
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,160
Go to the Bifrost!

1591
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,040
Sister.

1592
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,920
You're still alive.

1593
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,080
I love what you've done
with the place.

1594
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,520
Redecorating, I see.

1595
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,920
It seems our father's solution

1596
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,440
to every problem
was to cover it up.

1597
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,600
Or to cast it out.

1598
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,400
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1599
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,320
You see?

1600
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,080
You never knew him.

1601
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,280
Not at his best.

1602
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,440
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

1603
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,040
in blood and tears.

1604
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,120
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1605
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,040
And then, one day...

1606
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:53,200
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

1607
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,040
To foster peace,
to protect life...

1608
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,760
to have you.

1609
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,600
I understand why you're angry.

1610
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,280
And you are my sister,
and technically

1611
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,640
have a claim to the throne.

1612
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,800
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1613
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,040
But it can't be you.

1614
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,800
The worst.

1615
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,960
Okay, get up.

1616
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,240
You're in my seat.

1617
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,320
You know,
Father once told me...

1618
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,960
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

1619
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,640
But must always
be ready for it.

1620
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,360
Go back!

1621
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,720
HEIMDALL: Go!

1622
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,320
To be honest, I expected more.

1623
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,560
Heimdall!

1624
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,520
The sword!

1625
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,560
Here's the difference
between us.

1626
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,360
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1627
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,920
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

1628
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,920
-And you're nothing.
-

1629
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,920
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1630
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,280
Oh.

1631
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,920
Now you remind me of Dad.

1632
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,920
The stupid dog won't die!

1633
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,800
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

1634
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,280
You wanted to know who I am?

1635
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,800
What the hell
are you talking about?

1636
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,440
You'll see!

1637
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,320
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1638
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,840
I'll get that sword...

1639
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,680
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1640
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,720
Hey, man.

1641
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,320
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1642
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,680
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

1643
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:35,840
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

1644
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:49,240
Your savior is here.

1645
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,600
Did you miss me?

1646
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,080
Everyone, on that ship now.

1647
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,720
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

1648
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,960
Of course you did.

1649
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,960
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1650
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,120
You see...

1651
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,720
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1652
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,320
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1653
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,720
What were you
the god of, again?

1654
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,000
Even when you had two eyes...

1655
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,640
you'd see
only half the picture.

1656
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:00,000
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1657
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,760
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1658
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,320
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

1659
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,640
to focus it.

1660
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,160
It was never your source
of strength.

1661
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,160
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1662
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:21,000
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1663
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,440
This could be Asgard.

1664
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,840
Asgard is where
our people stand.

1665
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,480
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1666
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
I'm not as strong as you.

1667
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,200
No...

1668
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,880
you're stronger.

1669
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,200
Tell me, brother.

1670
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,680
What were you
the god of again?

1671
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,080
-

1672
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,360
-You're late.
-You're missing an eye.

1673
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,000
VALKYRIE: This isn't over.

1674
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,920
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

1675
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,640
Hit her
with a lightning blast.

1676
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,040
I just hit her with
the biggest lightning blast

1677
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,280
in the history of lightning.

1678
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,360
It did nothing.

1679
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,640
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1680
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,840
It won't end there.

1681
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,560
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1682
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,400
She'll hunt us down.

1683
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,040
We need to stop her
here and now.

1684
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:53,360
So what do we do?

1685
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,720
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1686
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:11,240
Asgard's not a place,
it's a people.

1687
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,320
Loki...

1688
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,440
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

1689
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,680
This was about
causing Ragnarok.

1690
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,400
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1691
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,480
It's the only way.

1692
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,520
Bold move, brother.

1693
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,240
Even for me.

1694
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,600
Shall we?

1695
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,760
After you.

1696
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,760
This is madness.

1697
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,800
Go! Go, now!

1698
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,360
For Asgard.

1699
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,040
SKURGE: Hela!

1700
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:03,720
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

1701
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,560
Hela, enough!

1702
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,960
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1703
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,720
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1704
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,400
You can't defeat me.

1705
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,520
No, I know.

1706
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:33,240
But he can.

1707
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:38,760
No.

1708
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:50,160
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1709
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,560
I am your reckoning!

1710
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,440
The people are safe.

1711
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,920
That's all that matters.

1712
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,000
THOR: We're fulfilling
the prophecy.

1713
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,000
I hate this prophecy.

1714
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,960
So do I,
but we have no choice.

1715
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,960
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1716
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,480
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1717
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,160
But we need to let him
finish the job,

1718
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,320
-otherwise...
-

1719
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:23,120
No!

1720
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,440
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1721
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,680
THOR: Hulk, stop.

1722
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,800
Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

1723
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,760
Big monster!

1724
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,280
Let's go!

1725
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,160
Fine.

1726
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,040
SURTUR: I am Asgard's doom!

1727
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,200
The damage is not too bad.

1728
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,360
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

1729
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,000
we can rebuild this place.

1730
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,520
It will become a haven...

1731
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,520
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1732
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,920
Now those foundations
are gone. Sorry.

1733
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,920
What have I done?

1734
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,480
You saved us from extinction.

1735
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,400
Asgard is not a place...

1736
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,720
it's a people.

1737
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,480
It suits you.

1738
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,640
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

1739
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,160
Maybe not.

1740
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:04,640
Thank you.

1741
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:07,760
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1742
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:13,440
I'm here.

1743
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:38,920
Your throne.

1744
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:57,160
So. King of Asgard.

1745
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,840
Where to?

1746
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,320
I'm not sure.

1747
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,160
Any suggestions?

1748
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,720
Miek, where are you from?

1749
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,880
Oh, Miek's dead.

1750
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:23,200
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1751
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,720
I've just felt so guilty,

1752
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:25,960
I've been carrying him around
all day.

1753
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,080
- Miek, you're alive!

1754
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,320
He's alive, guys.

1755
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,560
What was
your question again, bro?

1756
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,400
Earth it is.

1757
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,520
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1758
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:54,720
to go back to Earth?

1759
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:56,320
Yes, of course.

1760
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,520
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1761
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,840
Let me rephrase that.

1762
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,000
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1763
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,480
to bring me back to Earth?

1764
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:07,040
Probably not, to be honest.

1765
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,880
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1766
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:11,920
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1767
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,080
Oh, boy.

1768
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,360
Oh.

1769
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:54,480
I just gotta say,
I'm proud of you all.

1770
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:58,080
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1771
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,800
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

1772
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:03,120
Come on. No?

1773
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:05,680
Me too. 'Cause I've been
a big part of it.

1774
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:08,600
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1775
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,560
So, you're welcome.

1776
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,120
And, uh, it's a tie.
