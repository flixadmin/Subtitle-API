1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,969
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,408
- You need to leave Ms. Kringle alone.
- I get it now.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,801
You got a thing for my girl.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,926
Oh, dear.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,411
Who sent you?

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,450
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,808
- I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Sid Bunderslaw.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,363
The people of Gotham deserve to know that
there is a serial killer in their midst.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,010
<i>I'm coming after you.</i>

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,006
He murders the loved ones of any cop
who investigates him.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,128
Care to dance?

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,602
Morning. How'd you sleep?

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,922
The hour we slept?

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,724
Great.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,366
You hungry? I have quiche.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,760
No, thanks.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,400
At least have some coffee.

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,882
Let me tell you about the day
I have planned for us.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,123
- I think I'm just gonna get out of here.
- Wait.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
We had fun last night, right?

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,247
Stay.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,970
- Listen, you don't have to do this.
- Do what?

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,761
Last night at the ball,
you talked a good game.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,571
But let's not pretend
this is more than what it is.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,246
Barbara, I'm not pretending with you.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,722
I want you to stay with me.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,210
I don't think so.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,890
Wait, wait, wait.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,324
Let go.

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,525
Look...

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,844
I was pretending with you.

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,611
But not in the way you think.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,087
The night we met...

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,369
I was going to kill you.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,641
That's not funny.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,926
But then...

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,090
I saw something in you.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,368
Barbara, I saw...

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,649
the real you.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,886
You're the woman
that I have been searching for.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,603
You're lying.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,606
I'm gonna let you go now.

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,286
And you're going to sit down...

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,886
and have breakfast with me.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,367
No!

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,407
So we'll do it the hard way.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,731
- Hey. How are you doing?
- I've been better.

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,487
- Have you seen Harvey?
- No. Any word on Barbara?

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,761
They haven't found her body yet,
so there's a chance she's still alive.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,969
- When's the last time you slept?
- I don't know.

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,207
Last time you ate?

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,204
- I don't know.
- I know better than to try to get you to sleep.

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,647
- But you really should eat.
- I'm not hungry.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,768
Jim.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,371
It's not your fault.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,447
I did this. I pressed Loeb, he sent
the Ogre after me, and I didn't stop.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,447
It's bad enough I knowingly put you
in danger. I didn't even think of Barbara.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,961
- You were doing your job.
- But I should've known.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,691
How? You weren't together.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,366
Do you blame yourself
for falling out of love?

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,167
Lee, it's my responsibility. There's
nothing you can say that changes that.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,091
Whatever happens to Barbara, it's on me.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,242
- I understand.
- Jimbo.

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,564
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,087
He's been bragging
that he knows who the Ogre is.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,881
I keep telling you, man, you been lied to.
I don't know nothing.

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,128
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Unh.

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,244
Okey-doke.

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,200
No body, no crime. No body, no crime.

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,649
Nope. Never seen him before.

71
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,404
We think this is a serial killer
called the Ogre.

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,447
He's kidnapped a woman,
and he's gonna kill her...

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,005
unless we find him first.

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,207
Bummer.

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,850
Just so you understand...

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,721
the lady in question
is a real good friend of ours.

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,125
Supposing, for the sake of argument,
I did see him before.

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,560
What's she worth?

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,368
What's she worth?

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,204
Yeah, you know...

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,883
if you had to assign a dollar amount.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,481
Harvey, I'm about to violate departmental
policy on interrogation techniques.

83
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,730
I think I saw some doughnuts outside
with my name all over them.

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,765
Hey, now. Calm yourself.
There's no need to...

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,844
Jake worked as a barman at a brothel
called the Foxglove.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,685
Said the Ogre was a regular.
Can't give us a location.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,888
Because they never use
the same place twice.

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,724
- You know it?
- Not personally.

89
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,009
The Foxglove is very high-class,
very extreme.

90
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,248
You gotta know someone
who knows someone.

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,529
- I might know someone.
- You talking Penguin?

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,887
Get any deeper with that clown,
he will own you.

93
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,448
- I don't have a choice. The Ogre has Barbara.
- Let me shake a few trees.

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,251
Take the time, grab some Z's. You're burnt.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,404
The first one was the hardest.

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,849
But it wasn't her fault.
She just wasn't the one.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,968
I also couldn't let her go.

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,603
Still, it strengthened my resolve
to never stop till I found my soul mate...

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,570
the person I could
share everything with.

100
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,927
I think that person is you, Barbara.
But I need your help.

101
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,091
So...

102
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,446
let's begin again, shall we?

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,083
This just, um, came for you by messenger,
Master Bruce.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,290
Thank you.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,486
Right, well, I ought to be off.

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,966
Do you want company?

107
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,807
To identify Reggie?
No, I don't think so. Best done alone.

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,608
I'm sorry, Alfred.

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,730
- I know he was your friend.
- Just doesn't make any sense.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,562
Reggie topping himself like that.

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,361
You said he fell out of a window. He might
have been drinking, lost his balance.

112
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,007
That Reggie was a legend.

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,404
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope.

114
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,611
It doesn't matter
what he was like in the end.

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,650
I wanna see he gets a proper send-off.

116
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,807
I'll see you this evening, sir.

117
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,171
What?
Your boss doesn't trust his partners?

118
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,120
It's called due diligence.
He just wants me to look the place over.

119
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,964
So look.

120
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,283
I got a gravy going. Special party today.

121
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,283
Don't let me keep you.

122
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,489
Piece of work.

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,329
<i>I put the pistol under the bar,
machine gun behind the juke.</i>

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,004
All Connor and his guy gotta do
is get to them.

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,164
The day is finally here.

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,765
Maroni...

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,487
Jim. So lovely to see you.

128
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,484
To what do I owe this wonderful surprise?

129
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,166
I need to know where the Foxglove is.
And I need an invitation.

130
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,328
Well, someone's in a mood.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,684
Can you help me out? Yes or no?

132
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,285
Jim, I do so love
our give-and-take relationship.

133
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,522
But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.

134
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,369
Fine. I'll owe you a favor.

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,844
- You already do.
- Then I'll owe you another.

136
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,202
Cards on the table?

137
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,442
The Foxglove makes a lot of money
for some important...

138
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,209
You think you know who I am,
what I'm capable of?

139
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,408
You have no idea.

140
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,884
Today's an important day for me.

141
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,771
So I will accommodate your request.

142
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,806
But, detective, mark my words...

143
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,725
you owe me a big favor.

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,641
Here we have
the Physical Operations Department.

145
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,401
The Physical Operations Department
handles logistics for the corporation.

146
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,244
Management of our properties...

147
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,721
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

148
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,925
- Of course, Mr. Wayne. It's right here.
- Thank you.

149
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,443
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

150
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,171
- You score a ticket?
- Yep. But only one.

151
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,200
I figure you go in, pose as a john,
find something to bust them on...

152
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,607
then we squeeze them till they talk.

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,683
Smart move sending me.

154
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,690
You couldn't look more like a cop
if you wore a blue uniform.

155
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,411
You got something to wear?
You're, uh, gonna need to fit in.

156
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,007
Don't worry. Alvarez busted some guys
smuggling Italian suits last week...

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,926
and a couple fell in my locker
on their way to the evidence room.

158
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,971
I'm sorry I left you alone...

159
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,441
but you needed time to think,
to accept that this was real.

160
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,726
This apartment is soundproof, by the way,
so save your lungs.

161
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,881
Look at me. My hands are shaking.

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,368
That's never happened before
with any of the other women I've had here.

163
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,682
You know why that is?

164
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,570
Do you know why that is?

165
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,922
You're a psycho.

166
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,003
I don't know what you're thinking.

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,569
It's because...

168
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,406
I always somehow knew, deep down...

169
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,562
the others weren't the one.

170
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,608
They weren't the one.

171
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,010
I want this to work, Barbara.

172
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,002
You're scared. It's okay.

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,648
Jim will find me. Unh!

174
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,286
The only way you're going to make me
angry is if you mention his name.

175
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,724
Drink this.

176
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,051
It's water. You're dehydrated.

177
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,524
Barbara, come here.
I want you to see something.

178
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,287
Barbara, I love you.
I love you like no one has ever loved you.

179
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,240
But if you try to escape, I will chain
you to the ceiling and gut you.

180
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,768
Now come here.

181
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,680
Are those...?

182
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,811
When you're looking for love,
you have to kiss a lot of frogs.

183
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,650
Still, I should be thankful.
They led me to you.

184
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,488
All those women...

185
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,962
they died here?

186
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,283
You killed them...

187
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,290
here?

188
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,124
Yes.

189
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,885
Don't worry.

190
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,526
I'm gonna set you free.

191
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,570
You're the one, Barbara.

192
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,484
You're the one.

193
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,362
Hello, Bruce.

194
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,049
I've been expecting you.

195
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,007
Ever since your friend borrowed my key,
I've been expecting you.

196
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,049
Even canceled my trip.

197
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,170
Cookie?

198
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,730
When I was a boy...

199
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,406
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

200
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,724
You hired a man to kill Alfred.

201
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,327
I hired your guardian's comrade
to find out what you knew.

202
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,563
I never intended harm to come to anyone.

203
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,890
I told the board you were a special case,
that you'd need the talk early.

204
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,804
The talk.

205
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,089
Bruce, when members of the Wayne family
reach a certain age...

206
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,720
some facts of life and business
are explained...

207
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,406
Wayne Enterprises
is committing serious crimes.

208
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,642
Oh, my, yes.

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,761
This is a multinational corporation
operating in hundreds ofjurisdictions.

210
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,766
We do our best to subvert all of them
if it means profits.

211
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,404
- So you admit it?
- Just like your father.

212
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,367
He came in with his secret files
demanding justice...

213
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,567
at first.

214
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,362
Then he changed his mind.

215
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,567
You're lying.

216
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,361
Your father came to understand the reality
of this business.

217
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,046
As did his father, and as will you.

218
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,202
My father was a good man.

219
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,082
You have an opportunity
to live a blessed life.

220
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,722
The life your father and mother
wanted for you.

221
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,567
I beg you to reconsider.

222
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,085
Pardon me.

223
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,964
Lucius, come in.

224
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,846
Bruce Wayne, meet one
of our junior executives, Lucius Fox.

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,766
There's a public-relations person
desperately searching for this young man.

226
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,161
Then you'd best reunite them.

227
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,245
Bruce.

228
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,683
Don't forget your cookie.

229
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,171
Now...

230
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm going to tell you something, and I'd
appreciate if you kept your face still.

231
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,482
There's cameras everywhere.
I know because I put them there.

232
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,043
What I'm about to say must be a deep secret
between you and me.

233
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,486
I knew your father well. He was good man.

234
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,802
He wasn't the man
the company thought he was.

235
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
- I don't understand you.
- Bruce.

236
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,441
Your father was a true stoic.

237
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,888
He kept his best self hidden.

238
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,641
That's all I'll say.

239
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,010
Good luck.

240
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,131
- Mr. Nygma?
- Ms. Kring...

241
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,327
Ms. Kringle?

242
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,369
Would you open the door, please?

243
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,602
Um, I'm...

244
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,401
One sec.

245
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,761
I need the Hendricks case files.

246
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,321
Um, yes. Hendricks. Wait right there.

247
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,404
Hendricks, Hendricks, Hendricks.

248
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,846
Hendricks!

249
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,242
Ahh. Oh, my goodness.

250
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,403
- What happened to him?
- Um, ax.

251
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,210
Accidental death.

252
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,486
At a sheet-metal factory. Industrial saw.

253
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,443
Poor man.

254
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,968
I don't... I don't know
how you do this job.

255
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,600
- Death all around you.
- Heh.

256
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,565
Yes. One must have a sense of humor.

257
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,450
- The file?
- Yes.

258
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,521
Um, Mr. Nygma.

259
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,048
You haven't by chance seen Tom...?
Officer Daugherty?

260
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,401
We were supposed to have dinner
last night, and he didn't show.

261
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,451
- No surprise. But I haven't seen him today.
- Me neither.

262
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,530
Oh.

263
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,324
- Excuse me. I need to get back to work.
- Oh, uh.

264
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,324
- Now.
- Okay. Um...

265
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,089
Oh, dear.

266
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,809
You're sure the guns are there?

267
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,122
Butch placed them himself.

268
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,841
Do you remember what to say to Maroni
before you do the deed?

269
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,767
I never saw the point
in telling a man something...

270
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,127
right before you're gonna whack him.

271
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,650
But you're not the first to ask for it.

272
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,527
I appreciate you humoring me.

273
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,961
So how'd you know Maroni's gonna be
in this bar on this exact day?

274
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,047
I follow current events.

275
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,044
There he is. Tommy freaking Bones.

276
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,329
Nine years up the river,
and you get better-looking, you big animal.

277
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,807
I took care of myself.

278
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,809
I was hoping you'd remember.

279
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,962
- Ha, ha.
- Come over here. Huh?

280
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,090
Listen, you leave the joint,
you come to Lidia's for dinner.

281
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,964
That's tradition. Welcome home.

282
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,924
Lidia. Look who's here.

283
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,770
Welcome to the Foxglove. The evening's
entertainment is about to begin.

284
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,048
Well, I guess I'm just in time.

285
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

286
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,562
I know you have been eagerly awaiting
tonight's main attraction.

287
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,250
So please, let's give a big
Foxglove welcome to Ingrid and Gareth.

288
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,481
Ow!

289
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,806
Oh, no.

290
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,371
Hell, no.

291
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,242
G.C.P.D.! Nobody move.

292
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,846
Especially you two.

293
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,603
Barbara.

294
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,928
Wake up, Barbara.

295
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,770
Wake up.

296
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,806
Shh, shh. Come here.

297
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,082
Don't cry. Shh. Shh.

298
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,289
<i>Hey-</i>

299
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,291
There's no need to cry, okay?

300
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,881
You're gonna kill me.

301
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,726
- Do you want me to?
- No.

302
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,726
Then tell me who to kill.

303
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,331
What?

304
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,810
You still don't believe I love you.
You think I'm crazy.

305
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,122
That's fine.

306
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,123
I see the truth.

307
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,123
I see your truth.

308
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,804
I see that you've spent your whole life
trying to kill it, but you can't.

309
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,644
It's too strong.

310
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,644
You revealed it to me the other night.

311
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,849
I wanna set that free.
I wanna set you free.

312
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,967
You think that me making you
murder someone will make me like you?

313
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,245
That's insane.

314
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,531
You say that...

315
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,923
because you don't know what it is
to live without fear.

316
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,649
But you'll learn.

317
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,284
Now tell me who you want me to kill.

318
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:31,210
Or though it breaks my heart,
I will take your life right now.

319
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,484
I can't.

320
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,807
L... I can't.

321
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,087
I can't.

322
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,320
Tell me who to kill.

323
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,204
Okay.

324
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,325
You run this place?

325
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,171
I'm looking for this man.

326
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,529
Arrest me if you want to.
I don't talk about my clients.

327
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,211
One call to the Gazette,
they'll send a reporter down here.

328
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,842
I'll perp-walk each and every one
of your clients in front of the cameras.

329
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,160
How's that sound?

330
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,842
Talk to Sally.

331
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,166
You know him? You're sure?

332
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,729
I'm sure.

333
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,049
He said his name was Jason.
He was sweet.

334
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,204
As soon as I got into his car,
he pulled a hood over my head...

335
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,930
and tied my wrists.

336
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,971
He took me to back to his apartment.
That's where he did this.

337
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,165
I don't know why he let me go.

338
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,921
- When was this?
- Almost nine years ago.

339
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,084
About a year before the first murder.
He was working his way up.

340
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,242
Why didn't you go to the police?

341
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,291
I did. I was a hooker.
He was a rich man with no name.

342
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,211
Anything else you can tell us?
Anything about his apartment?

343
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,767
The smallest detail might help.

344
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,247
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

345
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,926
You can see out into the city.
We were in midtown.

346
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,885
And there was a big neon sign
on the building across the street.

347
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,130
I could only read the last four letters,

348
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,082
- Loyal? Royal?
- Royal.

349
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,130
- The Gotham Royal Hotel.
- That's in midtown. Tenth and Gainsly.

350
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,930
Thank you, Sally.

351
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,482
Promise me, when you find him,
don't arrest him.

352
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,087
Kill him.

353
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,764
You got it.

354
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,003
- Making jokes already. He's out two hours.
- Whoa, fellas. Private party.

355
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,929
Just here to pay respects.

356
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,449
Connor from the wild northeast.

357
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,921
What's that old man Falcone want now?

358
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,128
Don Falcone sends me with his respects...

359
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,921
and a small gift for you
and Tommy Bones on this happy day.

360
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,770
Cheech.

361
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,767
- Forgive my suspicious nature.
- Course. Can't be too careful.

362
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,960
Come here. Let me see this.

363
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,564
<i>Madre Di Dios.</i>

364
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,728
My favorite.

365
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,488
- Tell Falcone I appreciate the gesture.
- Don Falcone knew it was a special occasion.

366
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,644
We got time for a drink.
Lidia. Clean glasses, please.

367
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,643
- The gift comes with a message.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

368
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,122
He wants you to know that it wasn't easy
for him to decide to kill you.

369
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,850
Son of a bitch.

370
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,801
But business is business.

371
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,486
You believe it?

372
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,928
You both jammed. If that ain't
a sign from God, I don't know what.

373
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,491
- Please...
- Shut your mouth.

374
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,160
You're gonna take Don Falcone
a message from me.

375
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,800
You're gonna let him know
that you messed up...

376
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,611
and you're gonna let him know
that I'm coming for him.

377
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,370
Of course, you don't need to
be alive to tell him that.

378
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,170
Tommy, do the honors.

379
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,407
Wait...

380
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,163
<i>All you punks and all you Teds</i>

381
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,369
<i>National Fronts and Natty Dreads</i>

382
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,569
<i>Mods, rockers, hippies and skinheads</i>

383
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,370
<i>Keep on fighting 'til you're dead</i>

384
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,888
Connor blew it. Maroni's still alive.

385
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,008
This is flat.

386
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,531
Did you not hear me?

387
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,008
Maroni is still alive.
You gotta get out of town.

388
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,204
And miss all the fun?

389
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,210
You knew.

390
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,728
You set him up.

391
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,248
I took the firing pins out of the guns
before you hid them.

392
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,001
A spin on a trick I learned from Maroni.

393
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,568
- But you could have had Maroni dead.
- True.

394
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,007
But I still would've been
under Falcone's thumb.

395
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,725
And that...

396
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,087
has grown intolerable.

397
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,402
No, I'd much rather Maroni be alive...

398
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,451
and out for blood.

399
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,930
Alas, Officer Daugherty,
she's gonna wonder where you went.

400
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,285
Perhaps a letter?

401
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,570
You could say goodbye,
give her some advice.

402
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,811
Something that might lead her
to make better choices in the future, hmm?

403
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,649
Jim!

404
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,447
Place is empty.

405
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,329
But there's something you should see.

406
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,050
You see anything that connects to Barbara?

407
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,291
Maybe she was never here.

408
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,001
No, she was here.
I can still smell her perfume.

409
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,006
Hey. We're gonna find this guy.

410
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,322
But you need to prepare yourself...

411
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,361
that we might not be
in time to save her.

412
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,325
- That is not an option.
- It's the most likely option.

413
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,885
Hello?

414
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,809
<i>Detective Gordon.</i>

415
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,201
<i>I assume you're the one
who triggered the alarm.</i>

416
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,727
You son of a bitch. Where's Barbara?

417
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,570
<i>With me, of course.</i>

418
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,205
If you've hurt her...

419
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,522
<i>She's as safe as milk.</i>

420
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,082
<i>Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.</i>

421
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,046
- What <i>the</i> hell <i>does that mean?
- She doesn't need your protection, Jim.</i>

422
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,726
<i>Fact is, she never did.</i>

423
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,087
<i>- I'll see you around.
- Wait.</i>

424
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,726
- He was driving.
- To Tahiti if he's smart.

425
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,166
There was a noise, right?

426
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,245
A thumping.

427
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,041
- Like he was going over a bridge.
- You know, I heard a horn.

428
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,403
- Like a train horn.
- Okay. So which bridge has a train?

429
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,881
Um... Damn.

430
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,367
Whitecross. But that's the upstate train.

431
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,045
U DState?

432
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,568
<i>That's where her parents live.</i>

433
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,762
Barbara, please.

434
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,285
What's happening?

435
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,569
What's happening
is your daughter is finally waking up.

436
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,324
Please?

437
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,762
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

438
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,287
<i>I never meant to hurt you</i>

439
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,924
Jim?

440
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,204
Barbara.

441
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,287
What are you doing here?

442
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,442
You're not supposed to be here.

443
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,121
Where is he?

444
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,042
Drop it. Drop the knife, or I'll shoot.

445
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,803
Just an ounce of pressure,
and she'll split right open.

446
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,684
I don't want that. Do you want that?

447
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,563
It's gonna be all right, Barbara.
It's gonna be all right.

448
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,246
If you cared about this woman,
you never would have come after me.

449
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,882
- I love her more than you ever did.
- Drop the knife.

450
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,401
It won't be me that slits her throat.

451
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,762
Detective, that's gonna be you.

452
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,242
- Drop it.
- Jim, please.

453
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,727
Just leave us alone.

454
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,404
Hey. Jerk-o.

455
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,126
Barbara? Barbara?

456
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,131
- He's dead?
- Yeah. He's dead.

457
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,850
It's gonna be okay.

458
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,962
Look at me. Barbara.

459
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,651
It's gonna be okay.

460
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,127
Alfred, I never asked you...

461
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,241
how was it yesterday, seeing Reggie?

462
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,609
Not really an experience I'd
care to repeat, Master Bruce.

463
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,570
But then again,
the Reggie I knew died years ago.

464
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,566
Alfred, I haven't been honest with you.

465
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,562
After you were hurt...

466
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,491
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

467
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,847
We found him.

468
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,682
Did you, now?

469
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,486
He didn'tjump or fall.

470
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,806
Selina pushed him.

471
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,448
And why did she do that?

472
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,331
Reggie was sent here by a man
named Sid Bunderslaw.

473
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,207
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

474
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,606
Reggie gave us the name...

475
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,604
but said he was gonna tell Bunderslaw
what we were doing.

476
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,444
I see.

477
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,810
And the rest?

478
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,845
The charity ball?

479
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,162
Presumably to have access
to Mr. Bunderslaw.

480
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,044
Selina stole the key to his office safe.

481
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,131
I went there today. It was empty.

482
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,569
But Bunderslaw was waiting for me.

483
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,963
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

484
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,247
But he said that my
father and grandfather...

485
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,564
knew about the illegal things that
the company was doing, and chose...

486
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,367
They chose to stay quiet.

487
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,446
Your father was a good man.

488
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,085
I know.

489
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,490
But even good men have secrets.

490
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,370
- Good job.
- Yeah.

491
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,369
- Very well deserved.
- Well done.

492
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,006
- Man of the hour.
- Please.

493
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,404
- Very well.
- That guy right there.

494
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,528
Congratulations. You're a hero.

495
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,445
It won't last.
Tomorrow they'll go back to hating me.

496
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,090
Well, then I'll remind them.

497
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,845
Yesterday you were trying to help.
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

498
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,131
I would never try to change you, Jim.

499
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,965
Your sense of mission,
it's part of what I love about you.

500
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,521
I thought it was my devastating good looks.

501
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,727
That's a joke.

502
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,246
I was scared.

503
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,604
Scared that Barbara would get hurt...

504
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,923
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first...

505
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,447
and then whatever we had would die.

506
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,124
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

507
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
Lee, I love you.

508
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,161
Not her.

509
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,169
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

510
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,404
What did you do?

511
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,404
Grabbed a knife by the blade.

512
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,851
Of course you did.

513
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,327
- Let me see.
- Agh.

514
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,844
Ms. Kringle?

515
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,331
Are you okay?

516
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,681
I got a letter from Officer Dougherty.

517
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,924
He left town.

518
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,851
"Don't wait around for me.

519
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,083
Go have some fun, and maybe
I'll give you a call when I get back."

520
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,211
Blah-blah-blah.
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

521
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,284
I mean, why do I keep picking creeps?

522
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,884
Sometimes with men,
you need to read between the lines.

523
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,368
Sometimes with men, you need a drink.

524
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,561
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

525
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,524
Read between the lines.

526
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,926
Everybody listen up.

527
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,729
Just got wind of three attacks on Falcone
businesses in different parts of town.

528
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,123
Word is it's Maroni.

529
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,645
As of right now, all leaves are canceled
and all units are called in for active duty.

530
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,804
We're in a shooting war, people.
