Hyun-su.

173
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,703
Are you okay, Yi-kyung?

174
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,123
It's all my fault it's like this.

175
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,793
I just wanted her
to be safe like you were.

[whimpers]

177

All I wanted was for her to…
[sobs]

178
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,927
It wasn't your fault.

00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,900
I should've killed her.

183
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,155
In the back of my mind,
I always had that thought.

184
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,240
I know…

185
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,411
I know she must've felt it
when I had those thoughts.

186

[breathing heavily]

187
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,831
You're wrong.

188
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
I know because I was there too.

189
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,422
You said you were a bad mother,
but you know that's just not true.

190
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,424
The fault is all mine.

191
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,679
I was the one who made her like this.

192
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,349
No, this is good.

193
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,520
It turning out like this is for the best.

[Yi-kyung gasping]

195
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,024
This way, when…

196
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,613
I don't have to kill my daughter.

197
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
Were you really going to kill her?

198
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,164
Why? You're her mother.

199
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,208
So why?

200
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,918
I don't deserve to be.

201
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,922
I had the same thought hundreds of times.

202
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:08,512
"Why is she cursed like this?" Why?

203

[Yi-kyung sobbing]

204
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,390
It's all my fault.

205
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,227
My awful thoughts and desires

206
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,021
turned her…

207
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,191
into a…

208
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,029
monster.

209
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,448
Yeah, so what?

210
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,369
Are monsters really all bad?

[monster cooing weakly]

212

This one saved you.

213
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,680
Saved you 'cause you're family.

214
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,933
You see, monsters

215
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,269
feel and recognize people.

216
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,188
'Cause they were human once too.

What's going on with him?
What happened here?

228
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,294
[Ho-sang] He's been poisoned.

229
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,130
How much did he eat?

230
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,926
He had one bowl of that.

231
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,053
[Ho-sang] He had a whole bowl?

What was in this?

235
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,440
Mushrooms.

236

The magic kind.
[sighs]

[Ho-sang] This one's got a high tolerance.

But he's gonna need an antidote.

anyone could wear?

I found a whole stack of them
up there the other day.

No, it's not.

No.

This is personal.

That makes no sense.
How is finding Yong-seok personal, sir?

Take some men with you at least.

it doesn't really matter.

But what if they get both of us,
then what?

If it's a bust
and none of you make it back…

I'll be useless.

Wow, you two are really
making it dramatic here.

But I'm coming as well, Sarge.

Well, I'm also coming, sir.

Whoo, just got chills.

Let's roll out.

Man, what am I doing?

318
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,431
I can't drive with my hand like this.
Let's go! Let's go!

I really can't right now.

[Ye-seul sighs]

So you're just gonna steal
in plain sight like that.

330
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,207
[sighs]
Let me take the booze.

331
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,625
I'll pay.

332
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,086
Got any more?

333

So, uh…

00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,815
are you gonna accept her or not?

337
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,610
Stop it. He's a priest.
That's inappropriate.

338
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,612
I mean, why? I didn't say get hitched.

339

He can date, can't he?

340
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,408
That's enough.

341
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,785
Hey.

342
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,371
[Ye-seul] What's that?
What's going on over there?

You a couple?

Are you playing with my girl here?

345
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,959
Just go if you're drunk.

346
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,798
Damn. All men are the same. Pussies.

347
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,967
And that's why you're alone.

348
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,138
That sort of shit's
what scares them away, you know?

349
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,015
Get a load of this fucking bitch.

350
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,057
Hey!

351
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,852
You don't fucking know love, do you, huh?

I thought I was turning into
a monster there.

355
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,253
I thought I was hearing things.

356
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,213
Gosh, don't say things like that!

357
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,716
That last incident
was only a few days ago.

Yo!

359
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,514
When's the last time
you heard music, huh? Right?

360
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,810
You've got quite the odds
and ends, Father.

361

Pay up first.
You better confess if you want a drink.

362
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,399
I know you skipped out earlier.

Man, oh, man, that's harsh.

Oh, wait, what?

367
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,249
I mean, greed makes monsters of us all.

368
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,377
The only cure for that
is to love and share.

[Jin-a]
Being a monster doesn't sound so bad.

- Hey.
- [Gi-chun] That's right.

374
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,895
Sure. Living like this day to day
really sucks, but…

375
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,563
but we're still all here, huh?

376
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,693
I'm fine as long as I don't turn into
one of them.

[Gi-chun chuckles]
That's about all I can ask for.

378
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,323
There's so much
that I wanna go out and do.

If I could just hurry up
and get out of here.

It's a bit hard here.

What about you, Father?

382
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,293
You're always listening to us,

383
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,421
how about you talk this time?

384
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,380
[Jin-guk] Hear, hear.

- We're all ears.
- Let's hear it.

There isn't a before and after
for me, really.

I bet you were in debt.

You'd be dead wrong.

Stop talking out of your ass.

395
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,208
Bullshit. You were homeless.

396
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,379
How any rich person would rather
be boozing it up here, is ridiculous--

Ugh, I can't.

00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,634
I, Jung Ye-seul,

400
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,429
need to lighten this depressing mood.

401

Get up.

402
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,309
All right. And here we go.

You seem happy, Doc.

You wouldn't get it, Sergeant,
being that you come up here all the time.

That bag, what's in there?

415
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,326
A secret box.

What's in there?

[Dr. Lim] I just said it's a secret.

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,303
I didn't realize
you're so scared, Sergeant.

497
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,512
This one's already dead.

498
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,557
That's what I'm saying.
What's the fucking point of all this?

499
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,727
What? Some kind of monster museum?

500
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,770
- Those monsters…
- [Seo-jin] Jeez.

501
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,023
The monsters just now.

502
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,692
You noticed it too.

Monsters don't recognize each other.

00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,408
They never hunt as a group or go after…

506
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,744
a single target.

507
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,621
- Then what did we see?
- [Yeong-hu] Right.

508
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,414
Swarming all at once,

509
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,625
- like they were ambushing us.
- They were organized.

510
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,169
What? Are you saying
they set a trap for us?

511
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,672
Could've been they were trying
to protect their location.

Could you tell me
what I'm feeding him at least, huh?

It's been only a year.

How can it change this much in a year?

What do you mean, sir?

[Yeong-hu] Does doing that help?

As much as anything, I guess.

558

Think we're okay, sir?

Why are you asking me?

Why don't you ask your higher power, man?

561
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,408
I thought I was doing just that, Sergeant.

562

Don't ask me, jackass.

563

[Yeong-hu] You'll be coming with me,
Dr. Lim.

Seok-chan, you too.

Yes.

00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,839
- Understood.
- What, we're not all going together?

567
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,425
That's a little scary.

568
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,052
Just a bit.

569
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,265
Seo-jin, take the men
and go find Yong-seok, all right?

On it.

Which way are we heading?

00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,704
To my sector over there.

Mm. It's my house.

586

Have they said when we can go home?
I'm missing my house.

587
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,370
Not right now.

588
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,914
I hope that we can, eventually.

589
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,250
It's taking forever.

590
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,918
You won't go back.

591
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,087
[Jin-ok] Yeong-su.

592
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,632
It's all a bunch of lies.

593
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,885
And doesn't lying make us monsters
like Jun-il's mom?

594
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,179
[Seon-hwa] You're being bad,
Yeong-su, huh?

595
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,473
You should stop trying so hard to be good.

You might end up dead.

- Kim Yeong-su.
- Don't touch me!

598
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,395
Why should I listen
to what you have to say?

599
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,980
You're not even my real mom!

Why do you even bother with that kid?

601
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,410
I really don't wanna hear it.
Do me a favor and get out.

You think so?

604
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,379
I just hope this search is uneventful,
if you know what I mean.

605
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,757
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, what do you mean?

606
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,926
You could bring the ceiling down
looking for ants.

607

Even a little house can fall apart.
A place this massive?

Jesus, God knows.

609
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,183
You're exaggerating, come on!

610
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,852
And if we work hard, we might get
a little something extra.

611
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,020
Come on.

612
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,360
You're going for it?

No reason not to.

You don't have to do right, Ye-seul.

not to embarrass her.

Yes, sir. They arrived

Can we make contact?

01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,943
You're just gonna stand there?

988
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,576
In this life, we weren't meant to be,

989
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,204
maybe the next one.

990
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,582
Get rid of the girl though.
[soft chuckle]

991

- [car engine starts]
- [car door closes]

992
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,398
Are you okay to move?

993
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,150
How's your shoulder?

994
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:16,989
It's okay.

995
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,037
I think we'd better go.

996
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,707
Monsters might have heard the gunfire.

997
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,682
Let's go.

998
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,617
Hypocrite.

999
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,369
Goddamn coward.

1000
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,831
Are you going to say
you had no choice again?

1001
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,334
You're just running from the truth.

1002
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,883
You've been screwing up every decision
one after another.

1003
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:21,887
[banging on door]

1004
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,724
[banging continues]

1005
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,186
[people clamoring, screaming]

1006
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,739
[ominous music playing]

1007
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,590
[boy crying]

1008
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,759
[intense music playing]

1009
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,516
[crying continues]

1010
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,478
[In-hwan] <i>Aren't you gonna protect them?</i>

1011
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,231
[In-hwan's son] <i>Dad!</i>

1012
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:15,148
DAD
HELP ME

1013
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,525
<i>Help me!</i>

1014
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,778
[In-hwan]
<i>Does this look like protection to you?</i>

1015
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,156
[In-hwan's son] <i>I'm scared.</i>

1016
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,449
[In-hwan] <i>Just come clean.</i>

1017
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,784
[In-hwan's son] <i>Dad!</i>

1018
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,705
[In-hwan] <i>Just tell everyone
that the monster in the stadium is you.</i>

1019
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,456
[In-hwan laughing]

1020
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,793
[banging on door]

1021
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,881
[Dong-jun] Sir?

1022
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,550
Sir, may I come in?

1023
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,344
[suspenseful music playing]

1024
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,983
[Dong-jun] Sir? We have a problem.

1025
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,407
Sir?

1026
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,915
Sir, can you hear me?

1027
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,836
[suspenseful music intensifies]

1028
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,969
[music swelling]

1029
