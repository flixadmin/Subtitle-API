1
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,156
Where is he?

2
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>Where was Eddie
when that happened?</i>

3
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,100
Wha…

4
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,101
Wait, what?

5
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,145
Eddie.

6
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:04,938
Where was Eddie when you saw this?

7
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,608
He… He was in the…

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,277
…in the boat, like I said.

9
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,236
Right.

10
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,697
Right. Right.

11
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,658
But then, uh…

12
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,536
…who lifted Patrick out the water?

13
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,581
What…

14
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,460
You're not listening to me.

15
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,506
- Why aren't you listening to me?
- Jason, we are listening.

16
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:31,924
No, you're not. You're not.

17
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,051
Eddie, he's…

18
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:35,344
Eddie is a vessel.

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,180
Just a vessel.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,180
A vessel?

21
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,140
For Satan.

22
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,977
He's made a pact with the devil.
Now he has his powers.

23
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,777
You don't believe me.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,528
We're just, uh,

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,615
processing all of this, that's all. Okay?

26
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:56,990
Yeah.

27
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:09,002
How do you expect to stop the devil
if you don't believe he's real?

28
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,387
I can make it stop.

29
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,598
I can make the pain end.

30
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,980
Where's the girl?

31
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,816
I told you.

32
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,776
I don't…

33
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,653
I don't… I don't know.

34
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,490
There are two proposed explanations
for what is happening.

35
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,951
Explanation one,

36
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:49,497
an invisible boogeyman
from another dimension

37
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,290
is slaughtering these kids.

38
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,918
Explanation two,

39
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,629
Dr. Brenner's special little pet
has gone rogue again

40
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,673
and he and his lackeys

41
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,757
are now seeking to cover it up.

42
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,305
Perhaps in the hopes
of selling their pet to the Soviets.

43
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,016
Now,

44
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,603
which explanation sounds plausible to you?

45
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,687
Hmm?

46
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,024
I don't know.

47
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,737
There's still a chance
to redeem yourself, Mr. Wallace.

48
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,408
Where is she?

49
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,379
No!

50
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,423
No! No!

51
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,884
No!

52
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>Do you know what happens
when someone has a stroke?</i>

53
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:05,113
The blood supply to the brain is cut off.

54
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,160
It scrambles the signals in the brain
to the point where the mind

55
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:10,952
can forget how to do things.

56
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,663
To eat. To speak.

57
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,040
To walk.

58
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>When you were attacked last year,</i>

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,170
<i>I believe that your signals
were scrambled in much the same way.</i>

60
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:25,093
<i>But just as a stroke victim
can learn to walk again,</i>

61
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:28,303
<i>I believe you, too,
can return to your full power.</i>

62
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:34,726
Your abilities are still in here.

63
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,896
You just need to remember.

64
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,194
Everything that took place in my lab

65
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,113
was captured on videotape.

66
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,742
Every success and every failure.

67
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,581
<i>It's important for you
to not just see your past,</i>

68
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,625
<i>but to fully re-experience it.</i>

69
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,420
<i>In doing so, I believe we can</i>

70
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,297
<i>repair your broken signals.</i>

71
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:08,052
<i>As we saw tonight,
that process has already begun.</i>

72
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,601
If this all happened,

73
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,230
why don't I remember?

74
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,649
Because you do not want to.

75
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,028
Our brains have
a defense mechanism in place

76
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:30,031
to protect it from bad memories.

77
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,992
From trauma.

78
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,370
<i>You buried these memories long ago.</i>

79
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,084
Papa.

80
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,879
When I was in there,

81
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,591
I saw something.

82
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:49,759
There was blood.

83
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,180
So much blood.

84
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:56,766
That was another memory,

85
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,019
a… a more powerful one,

86
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
invading from your subconscious.

87
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,358
You have demons, Eleven.

88
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,110
You have demons in your past.

89
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,072
That is why we must proceed carefully.

90
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,242
One step at a time,

91
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,829
<i>one memory at a time.</i>

92
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,790
<i>If we go too fast,</i>

93
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm afraid you could
become lost in the darkness.

94
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,591
And if you are lost…

95
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,138
So are we all.

96
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,538
Oh.

97
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,041
Hey, Eric. I'm taking five.

98
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:03,750
You just took five.

99
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,921
Yeah, well, tell Milo
to take it easy on the onions next time.

100
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,025
Not to be a wimp,
but can I sit in the car?

101
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,778
'Cause this is gonna
totally and royally suck.

102
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,114
It'll be fine.

103
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,241
I can't stand to see
those dull eyes of Eddie's break again.

104
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,701
I really, really can't.

105
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,120
At least he can drink himself
into feeling better.

106
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:41,413
That's what my mom does.

107
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,039
Why don't we give it a trial?

108
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,793
"Hey, Eddie.
Uh, good news first this time."

109
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,129
"We got you some Dustin-approved junk food
and that six-pack you requested."

110
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,840
"Oh yeah, and we found Vecna."

111
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,927
"Bad news is that he's in that other,
darker, much scarier dimension,

112
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,304
and the gate's closed,
so we have no way of getting to him."

113
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,349
"He's entirely shut off to us,
so basically you're screwed."

114
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,559
"And, no, I know
you were already screwed,

115
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,312
but now you're doubly, triply screwed."

116
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,315
Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that.

117
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,774
"We're one step closer to finding Vecna."

118
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,860
That's what we say.
That's what's important.

119
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,779
See, Robin? Positive spin
can make all the difference.

120
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,697
Uh-huh.

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,408
Oh shit.

122
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,710
Nothing to see.

123
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,130
Just step back a little.

124
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,215
All right?

125
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,009
- This way.
- As many of you know,

126
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,886
the Roane County line received a call

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,347
a little after midnight…

128
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,390
…reporting a homicide here on the lake.

129
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,561
Officer Callahan here and myself

130
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>arrived first on the scene.</i>

131
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,691
<i>We made our way
to the shore of Lover's Lake,</i>

132
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,778
<i>about ten yards from that house
you see behind me.</i>

133
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,947
<i>It was there that we found the victim,</i>

134
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,408
<i>an 18-year-old senior from Hawkins High,</i>

135
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,077
<i>Patrick McKinney.</i>

136
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,705
His limbs…

137
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,374
- Oh my God.
<i>- …His body, it was disfigured…</i>

138
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:09,876
What are we even doing?
I mean, where is the FBI?

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,464
<i>- There was an eyewitness on the scene…</i>
- That's what I want to know.

140
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,383
We got a serial killer on the loose.

141
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,635
<i>We have also identified
a person of interest.</i>

142
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,971
<i>Eddie Munson.</i>

143
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:23,264
<i>We encourage anyone with information</i>

144
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,975
- to please come forward.
- Oh man.

145
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:28,019
This is not good. Really not good.

146
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,731
You've got a lot of questions,
and I'm going to answer as many as I can.

147
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,900
Two o'clock at town hall,

148
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,363
<i>where anyone from the Hawkins community
is welcome. But right now,</i>

149
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,282
I've got work to do,
and I appreciate your understanding.

150
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,451
Is Eddie still in Hawkins?

151
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,037
<i>Dustin, can you hear me? Wheeler?</i>

152
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,748
Eddie. Holy shit.

153
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,790
<i>Are you okay?</i>

154
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,086
Nah, man.
Pretty… Pretty goddamn far from okay.

155
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,838
- Where is he?
- Where are you?

156
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,133
- Skull Rock. Do you know it?
<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>

157
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,845
- That's near Cornwallis and...
- Garrett, yeah. I know where that is.

158
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,304
Hold tight. We're coming. We're coming.

159
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,991
I can't feel my butt.

160
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,494
Can't feel my butt.

161
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,037
Can you guys feel your butts?

162
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,456
I can feel my butt.

163
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,417
Everyone needs to be
on their best behavior, okay?

164
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,501
Why are you looking at me
when you say that?

165
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,921
- I didn't.
- They're just really religious.

166
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,006
Yeah, and I'm super spiritual, dude.

167
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,634
Yeah, I think they're spiritual too.
Just in a different way.

168
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,642
Oh. Hey.

169
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,186
Is Suzie here?

170
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,063
Ow!

171
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,073
Away, you starveling!

172
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,410
You elf-skin! You dried neat's tongue!

173
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,871
This is my kind of party.

174
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,206
I've been bitten.

175
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,375
Help! Help!

176
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,836
- Beautiful performance.
- Excuse me.

177
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,712
Uh, hey, we're looking for Suzie.

178
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,926
Can you not see

179
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,802
that we are filming?

180
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,179
Come on.

181
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,267
All right, stay in it, Tabitha.
Stay in it.

182
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,605
Hi, we're looking for Suzie.

183
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,398
Don't know, don't care.

184
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,528
That's too much salt, Peter.
Father's kidneys! Father's kidneys!

185
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,489
Cornelius!

186
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,075
How many times do I have to tell you?

187
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,618
That is not a toy.

188
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,495
Come on.

189
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,044
You make another escape,

190
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,380
I'm getting Father.

191
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:06,177
Who the hell are you?

192
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:09,472
Argyle.

193
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,976
Uh, and you are?

194
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,104
Eden.

195
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,105
- Like the garden.
- Wow.

196
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,274
- We're looking for Suzie.
- Do you know where she is?

197
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:21,360
Third floor, second door on your left.

198
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:25,822
You make sure to give that selfish
four-eyed shit a nice little shove for me.

199
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,448
Absolutely.

200
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,908
Eden, I…

201
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,580
I will shove her for you. I will…

202
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,874
I will do anything for you.

203
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,586
Well, great, she's not here.

204
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,798
"Give her a shove."

205
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,469
- Suzie!
- Yeah?

206
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,139
Who the heck are you?

207
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,099
And what are you doing in my room?

208
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,434
- Sorry, that's… that's fair.
- No, listen.

209
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,269
- We're Dustin's friends.
- Yeah.

210
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,897
We really need your help.

211
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:19,335
You said an hour.

212
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
I underestimated.

213
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:23,254
I thought you were dead.

214
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,756
Might as well be.

215
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,217
We are truly in hell if hell froze over.

216
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,307
There's nothing south,
but two miles north I saw some smoke.

217
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,768
Could be a town, a house.

218
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,687
Maybe somebody there knows
where we can find this prison.

219
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,773
The top-secret prison.

220
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:41,856
Really?

221
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,857
Right.

222
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,445
Any luck with our friend?

223
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,947
What do you think?

224
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:54,452
Hey!

225
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,330
Dipshit!

226
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,212
We're outta here. Last chance.

227
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,840
Where's the prison?

228
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,049
I told you.

229
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,385
Yuri will help you for the right price.

230
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,471
I told you, we're wasting our time.

231
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:15,557
- Half.
- What?

232
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,309
- What?
- You heard me, you stubborn bastard.

233
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,477
Half the reward.

234
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,812
Twenty thousand.

235
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,855
- Thirty thousand.
- Twenty-two.

236
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,024
Twenty-five.

237
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,943
All right.

238
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:31,407
Looks like we got ourselves

239
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,533
a moron!

240
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,662
You thought I was serious?

241
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,831
He thought I was serious.

242
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,040
I got you!
I got you good!

243
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,046
There's only one thing you get
if you take this deal.

244
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,006
You get to live.

245
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,966
You are not killer.

246
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,384
Oh, you're right.

247
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,385
He's not a killer.

248
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,428
No.

249
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,431
Thing is, we don't need to kill you.

250
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,432
We can just leave you here.

251
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:00,686
Because there's nothing for miles

252
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,813
and no one will find you.

253
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,190
No human, at least.

254
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,859
- I saw tracks.
- Tracks.

255
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,737
In the woods, Yuri.

256
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,698
- Bears.
- Bears.

257
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,075
Who knew you could see your own future?

258
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,869
Shall we fly out of here, little bird?

259
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:20,622
Uh, <i>da, da.</i>

260
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,499
Bye-bye, Yuri.

261
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:31,508
Wait.

262
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
You should go east, not north.

263
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:40,224
My warehouse is there.
Supplies, guns, truck.

264
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,853
We will need to reach prison by nightfall

265
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,938
if you hope to save your friend.

266
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,775
That is, if he's not already dead.

267
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,365
Out.

268
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,616
Everyone out.

269
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,619
Let's go! Move it!

270
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
This is it, American.

271
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:16,761
I hope you're ready.

272
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,486
What are you all waiting for?

273
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,569
Move!

274
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,030
Let's go!

275
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,075
Move!

276
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,943
Am I dreaming, American?

277
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,406
Or is this real?

278
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,298
What is wrong
with your American friend?

279
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,595
He has lost his spirit to live.

280
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,138
And he is not my friend.

281
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:45,474
Isn't that right, Cursed One?

282
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,978
You have lost your spirit to live.

283
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,271
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

284
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,901
No…

285
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,906
He is American after all.

286
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,660
Big talk, but weak inside.

287
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,078
Tell him to eat.

288
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,415
Or he endangers us all.

289
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,377
We have a big fight ahead of us.

290
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,130
What are you talking about? Fight?

291
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:19,134
I have been in this place one week.

292
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,596
My first night,

293
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,597
I saw six men enter this room.

294
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,432
Six.

295
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,101
Just like us.

296
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,728
They came out

297
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,357
happy and fat, faces smothered in grease.

298
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,987
But when night fell,
they were thrown into that pit out there.

299
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,739
But not alone.

300
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,825
You heard those roars, yes?

301
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,038
That is a monster.

302
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
Not from this world.

303
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,089
Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...

304
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,883
And all six men…

305
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,884
You speak no sense.

306
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,637
If they plan to kill us tonight,
why waste this food on us?

307
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,390
They want us strong.

308
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,557
So we can fight it.

309
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,852
To test its strength.

310
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:13,105
To train this monster for war.

311
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,566
But last week, the men got their weapons...

312
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,611
then scattered like fools.

313
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,904
We stick together...

314
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,781
Perhaps we stand a chance!

315
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,410
Perhaps we live to see another day.

316
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,872
Till tomorrow!

317
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,458
Let me guess.

318
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:35,919
This…

319
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,339
…it's about nine feet tall?

320
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,425
Thin, white skin?

321
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,135
No face?

322
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:46,846
No eyes?

323
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,308
Come on, come on, come on. Translate!

324
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,155
How do you know this?

325
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,450
'Cause I've seen one.

326
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,492
And I've fought one.

327
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,371
And all your theories about it,

328
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,040
they're all wrong.

329
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,211
You know why they feed
captive predators live prey?

330
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:24,675
Because if they don't, the predator
gets bored and it stops eating.

331
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,471
It needs the thrill of the hunt.

332
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:37,021
We're not here to train this monster
with swords and axes.

333
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,941
We're here to entertain it.

334
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:42,943
And this food…

335
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,740
This food isn't to make us strong.

336
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,161
It's to, uh, make us plump.

337
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:58,250
So we're full of the nutrients and protein
that a growing monster might need.

338
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,924
So eat up, boys.

339
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,634
Enjoy.

340
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,512
This is your last meal.

341
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,756
Which number are you aiming for?

342
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,220
Three.

343
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,059
You know,

344
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,688
sometimes

345
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,357
it's helpful to take a step away
for a moment.

346
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,734
Let the mind clear.

347
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,084
Determined, aren't we?

348
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,336
You know…

349
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,048
…you remind me of someone.
Someone I used to know really well.

350
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,509
Can you guess who that is?

351
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,854
One?

352
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:45,608
- Papa said that he doesn't...
- Exist? I know.

353
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,615
But can I tell you a secret?

354
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,950
Sometimes,

355
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,744
Papa doesn't tell the truth.

356
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,123
I spent years with One.

357
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,250
Right here.

358
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,794
In this very room.

359
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:05,921
Where is he?

360
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,465
Maybe we'll save that story
for another day.

361
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,094
It doesn't have a happy ending,
I'm afraid.

362
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,555
But he was a lot like you.

363
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,641
Everything was hard for him.

364
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:21,228
Then, out of nowhere,
he walked in here and it was like

365
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,355
something had changed.

366
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:27,150
And I asked him what's different,
and he said…

367
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,948
He said he had figured it out.

368
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,576
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

369
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
Something that made him sad.

370
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,665
But also angry.

371
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:44,917
Do you

372
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,336
maybe have a memory like that?

373
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,134
Do you remember the day
a strange woman came to see you?

374
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,138
This would've been
when Eight was still here.

375
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,769
The woman,

376
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,230
she was calling a name to you.

377
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,150
Jane. No! No!

378
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,777
No! Jane!

379
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,653
That

380
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:14,948
was your mother.

381
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:18,951
Mama is dead.

382
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,869
She died making me.

383
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:22,079
And who told you that?

384
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,163
Papa.

385
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,837
Who doesn't always tell the truth.

386
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,424
This place…

387
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,760
And the people here…

388
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,848
Are not what you think.

389
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,980
- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, Papa.

390
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,027
I've got something very special
planned for you today.

391
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,778
Are you ready?

392
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,572
Yes, Papa.

393
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:56,865
Good.

394
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,950
Seventeen, would you open the door?

395
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,785
- Yes, Papa.
- Off you go.

396
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:10,795
After you.

397
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,310
We should've just told her the truth.

398
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,686
And risk everything?

399
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,480
No.

400
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,192
She'll find out soon enough.

401
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,382
Dude, I'm telling you,
you're taking us the wrong way.

402
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,717
It's north. I'm positive.
I checked the map.

403
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,428
You do realize Skull Rock,
it's a super popular make-out spot?

404
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,429
Yeah. So?

405
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,307
Yeah, well, it wasn't popular
until I made it popular.

406
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
All right? I practically invented it.

407
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,435
- We're heading in the wrong direction.
- Steve.

408
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,523
- Where are you going? Steve!
- Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.

409
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,361
Okay, so apparently
we're going this way now?

410
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,613
I swear to God, if they get us lost…

411
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,909
Hey.

412
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,536
You okay?

413
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:25,662
Uh, yeah.

414
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,748
I'm fine. Just…

415
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,667
Thinking about Patrick. You know?

416
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,252
Yeah.

417
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,922
I mean, it's… it's like,

418
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,298
why him?

419
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,845
But then, I remember this one day,

420
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:44,012
he… he came to practice with a black eye.

421
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:47,517
He said he fell, but clearly he was lying.

422
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,646
It's like everyone Vecna targets

423
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,732
has something in their life.

424
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,444
- Something that's...
- Hurting them.

425
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:01,865
Haunting them.

426
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:03,950
Yeah.

427
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,453
I… I didn't really know Patrick,

428
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,080
so it was easy to just

429
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,791
look the other way, I guess.

430
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,336
But I did know you.

431
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,384
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

432
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:22,844
It's not your fault.

433
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,012
- No.
- I disappeared.

434
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,847
No, no, you didn't.

435
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
I just didn't look hard enough.

436
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,478
Okay?

437
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,480
But I see you now.

438
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,856
I see you.

439
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:45,157
Oh my God, they're so adorable.
I just wanna squeeze 'em, you know?

440
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:49,996
If I'm permitted to see a silver lining
in this end-of-the-world doom and gloom,

441
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:54,875
it would be the rekindling of old flames
that never should've been snuffed out.

442
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,378
I didn't mean that as a hint or anything.

443
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,463
Right.

444
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,509
But if I did mean it as a hint,
would that be so terrible?

445
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,470
To wish for happiness for my friends?

446
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,596
You think I'm not happy?

447
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,681
I… I'm sure you are.

448
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,849
It's just, the other day,
I mentioned Jonathan

449
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:13,185
and you flinched
or winced or something like...

450
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,395
I didn't flinch or wince.

451
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,315
- Okay.
- Jonathan and I are fine.

452
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:18,357
- Got it.
- We're good.

453
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,817
Right.

454
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,111
It's just…

455
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,367
He was supposed to be here for the break,

456
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:33,789
and then he backed out at the last minute
for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.

457
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,084
And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised

458
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,294
because I've been
feeling him pulling away.

459
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:41,130
And I don't know
if it's because we're 2,000 miles away

460
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,549
or if he met someone new or what.

461
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,343
And now I can't find out why

462
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:48,637
because apparently he's blown up
his family's house phone or something.

463
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:53,518
So, yeah, if… if the mention of his name
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,

464
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,311
that's… probably why.

465
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,358
Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason
to flinch, wince, or something.

466
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,824
You said, "the happiness of your friends."

467
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,660
So does that make us friends?

468
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,537
As in, officially?

469
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,455
Uh, yeah. I… I mean, right?

470
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,208
Right.

471
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,670
Oh, boom!

472
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:23,088
Bada bing, bada boom.
There she is, Henderson.

473
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,382
Skull Rock.

474
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:27,343
In your face, man.
In your stupid, cocky little face.

475
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,386
Doesn't make sense.

476
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,097
Yeah, yeah. Even with it staring you
in the face, you can't admit it.

477
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,182
Can't admit you're wrong, you butthead.

478
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,184
I concur.

479
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,479
You, Dustin Henderson, are a…

480
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,148
Total butthead.

481
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,026
Jesus, we thought you were a goner.

482
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,528
Yeah, me too, man.

483
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:47,447
Me too.

484
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,578
How long have you known
Eddie was killing these kids?

485
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,663
It was his trailer
where Chrissy was killed,

486
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,834
and you expect us to believe
he was made a suspect just this morning?

487
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:03,128
The truth is we've been
following several leads,

488
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,757
and, yes, Eddie Munson was one of them.

489
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,635
And we are now doing everything
in our power to find him.

490
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,347
In the meantime, for your safety,

491
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,557
we will be enforcing a strict curfew.

492
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,727
- What?
- That's your solution?

493
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,688
- Hide from him?
- We're already doing that.

494
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,522
It's been days. Days!

495
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:25,151
So you tell me why
he's not behind bars right now.

496
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,863
I understand you all are upset,
but I promise you,

497
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,530
we will find him.

498
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,657
No.

499
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,453
You won't.

500
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,955
Jason?

501
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,916
Son, how about
we talk about this in private?

502
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,670
Why? So you can keep me quiet?

503
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,130
So you can keep the truth from coming out?

504
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:47,965
I don't know about the rest of you,

505
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,801
but I can't bear to listen
to any more excuses and lies.

506
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,136
- That's enough.
- I agree, I've had enough!

507
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,223
In fact, I think we've all had enough.

508
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,111
Last night…

509
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,743
Last night, I saw things,
things I can't explain.

510
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:22,290
Things the police don't wanna believe.

511
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
And things that
I don't wanna believe myself.

512
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:28,172
But I know what I saw. I know.

513
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,968
And I've come to accept an awful truth.

514
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:36,681
These murders are ritualistic sacrifices.

515
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:40,143
We've all heard how satanic cults
are spreading through our country

516
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
like some… some disease.

517
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,186
And Eddie Munson

518
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,981
is the leader of one of these cults.

519
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,483
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.

520
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,278
The mall fire.

521
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,530
All those unexplained deaths
over the years.

522
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:57,326
Some people say our town is cursed.
They just don't know why.

523
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,037
Now… Now we do.

524
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,579
Now we know.

525
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,876
They call themselves Hellfire.

526
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,461
That's bullshit!

527
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,840
The Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's a club for nerds.

528
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,884
- Erica!
- Just the facts.

529
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,800
A club.

530
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,929
A club. A harmless club.
That's what they want you to think.

531
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,182
But it's a lie.

532
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,184
A lie designed to conceal the truth.

533
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:28,608
And now this cult
is protecting its leader, Eddie.

534
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,775
Hiding him.

535
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,070
Allowing him to… to continue his rampage.

536
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:37,282
Last night, I became overcome
with this feeling of… of hopelessness.

537
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:40,952
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.

538
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,873
"Do not be overcome by evil."

539
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,043
"But overcome evil with good."

540
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,503
And God knows there's good in this town.

541
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:52,215
So much good. It's in this room!

542
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:55,009
It's in this room, right here, right now.

543
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,512
So I came here today, humbly,

544
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,304
to ask for your help.

545
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,349
To join me in this fight.

546
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,353
Let us cast out this evil
and save Hawkins together.

547
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,541
What are y'all just sitting around for?

548
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,876
You heard the kid.

549
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:38,219
Hey.

550
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,472
I want you all to hear me
loud and clear on this.

551
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,059
Anyone interfering with this investigation

552
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,811
will be arrested.

553
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:50,021
Hey! Hey!
We<i> will </i>be implementing a curfew.

554
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:54,610
If you are not in your house after sunset
with the doors locked,

555
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:55,862
you'll be written up.

556
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,697
And it's gonna go
on your permanent record.

557
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:07,581
<i>Okay, that is a lot to process.</i>

558
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:12,460
I mean, that might be seriously
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

559
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,005
I know, it's hard to believe.

560
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,505
But it's true. All true.

561
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,552
I dial in to this computer
and find a location,

562
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:23,347
and at this location is the Nina Project?

563
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,347
Exactly.

564
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:27,934
And the Nina Project
is the code name for a video game?

565
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:30,896
No, it's not just a video game.
It's a video game console.

566
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,398
It's basically America's answer
to Nintendo.

567
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,983
Americantendo.

568
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,152
That's a stupid name.

569
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,405
You're right, it is a stupid name,
but, Suzie, it's 16-bit.

570
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,740
Sixteen-bit?

571
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,869
- Why have I never heard of it?
- Because it's top secret.

572
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,289
- That's why we're doing this.
- Yeah, right. It's for the promotion.

573
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:50,750
The first people to find
the secret location receive a...

574
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,043
- Americantendo?
- Uh, an Americantendo.

575
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,880
So you drove 3,000 miles
over your spring break

576
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,215
so I can help you get
a new video game console

577
00:36:58,298 --> 00:36:59,382
no one has ever heard of?

578
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,760
Yes.

579
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,472
- But it's not for us. It's for Dustin.
- Right.

580
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:07,682
Exactly. It's for Dustin.
For Dustin's birthday, which is…

581
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,476
In two months, three days, five hours.

582
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,311
I don't know what you're doing,

583
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:13,773
but I am not spending
my entire day babysitting.

584
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,942
- Pull your damn weight.
- Language!

585
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,068
Oh no, am I gonna burn in hell now?

586
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,110
You tell her, Eden.

587
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:21,905
- Out of my room.
- Don't touch me, you little shit!

588
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,951
Okay, so can you help?

589
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,286
I would do anything for Dustybun,

590
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,956
but I'm afraid there's been
an unfortunate development.

591
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,378
<i>After changing Dusty's grade,
I was wracked with the most awful guilt.</i>

592
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,505
Suzie, I am incredibly disappointed.

593
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,840
<i>Father could see my soul was tortured,
and he wrenched a confession out of me.</i>

594
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,385
I wanted to help him.

595
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:45,679
<i>Not only was I breaking the law,
I was dating an agnostic.</i>

596
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,764
<i>An agnostic!</i>

597
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:50,351
<i>- I've never seen Father so angry.</i>
- …starting today.

598
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,476
He needed me.

599
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,521
<i>- Naturally…</i>
- Father, no!

600
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,690
<i>…after learning the terrible truth,</i>

601
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,440
<i>he confiscated my computer.</i>

602
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,985
<i>And Father is not one to change his mind.</i>

603
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:03,072
<i>I'm as likely to see it again
as I am my poor Dustybun.</i>

604
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,032
Where is it?

605
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,032
His study.

606
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,994
He uses it for work now.

607
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,164
And Father's always working,
and his door is, like, permanently locked.

608
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,083
I'm really sorry.

609
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,418
Truly.

610
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,670
But it looks like you came
all the way here for nothing.

611
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:20,880
Cornelius!

612
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,885
Unless…

613
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:26,762
Unless?

614
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,222
There might be a way.

615
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,889
But we're gonna need help.

616
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,059
And I mean a lot of help.

617
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,853
All right.

618
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:52,954
Guys?

619
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,123
Are you down here?

620
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:55,708
Guys?

621
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:00,128
They should've been back by now.

622
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:01,338
They should be back.

623
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,840
- What time was the movie?
- Uh, four hours ago.

624
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,469
Hate to break it to you, Mrs. Wheeler,
but they lied to you.

625
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,054
- ♪ <i>Liar, liar, pants on fire ♪</i>
- Holly.

626
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:12,182
We don't think they're actually involved
with Eddie, do we?

627
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,851
I think at this point,
anything's possible.

628
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:18,606
- Our children are not murderers, Ted.
- Don't put words in my mouth.

629
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,317
See, she does that, twists my words.

630
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,277
You're calling the theater?

631
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,487
The police.

632
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,452
When I got to the shore,
I tried calling you guys, but, uh…

633
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:37,083
My walkie was busted, man.

634
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,125
Drenched.

635
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,170
So, uh, I did the thing
that I do now, apparently.

636
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,297
I ran.

637
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,175
Do you know what time this was?
The attack?

638
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,137
Yeah, no, I… I know
exactly what time it was.

639
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,391
My walkie wasn't the only thing
that got soaked.

640
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,896
- 9:27.
- Same time our flashlights went kablooey.

641
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,688
Which means what, exactly?

642
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,568
That that surge of energy
was Vecna attacking Patrick.

643
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,695
Well, we're one step closer.

644
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,530
We know how Vecna attacks.

645
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,199
And where he attacks from.

646
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,577
So now we just need to sneak into
his lair in the Upside Down

647
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,161
and drive a stake through his heart.

648
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,329
If he has a heart.

649
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,581
A stake? Is he like a vamp?
Is he a vampire?

650
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,876
- It was a metaphor.
- A bullet should work on him, right?

651
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,378
I say we chop his head off.

652
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,672
All of the above,
but we can't do any of that

653
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,217
- 'til we find a way into the Upside Down.
- We need El to get her powers back.

654
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,554
Everything was way easier.
We had this girl. She had superpowers.

655
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,056
Superpowers. Yeah, you mentioned her.

656
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:38,351
Hey, uh, Henderson's not,
uh, cursed, is he?

657
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,228
Cursed? No, no. He's fine.

658
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,981
Mental? Absolutely.

659
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:44,817
Boom!

660
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,612
Bada… bada… boom.

661
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,990
I was right.

662
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,492
Skull Rock was north.

663
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,704
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,456
- This is Skull Rock. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,876
You're totally, absolutely,
100% wrong. Right now.

666
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,918
Yes.

667
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,253
And no.

668
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:06,422
Oh my God.

669
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,257
This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.

670
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,469
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.

671
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,512
But it started to slip
the further east we went.

672
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,097
Now it's way off.

673
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,684
When I was leading us here,
I wasn't wrong.

674
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,728
The compass was.

675
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,896
So you're using faulty equipment.
You're still wrong.

676
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,898
Except it isn't faulty.

677
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,233
Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?

678
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,777
- An electromagnetic field.
- Yep.

679
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,780
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.

680
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,699
In the presence
of a stronger electromagnetic field,

681
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:37,577
the needle will deflect
towards that power.

682
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,164
So either there's some
super big magnet around here, or…

683
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,081
There's a gate.

684
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,751
But we're nowhere near the lab.

685
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,255
But what if, somehow,
there's another gate?

686
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,007
A gate that we don't know about.

687
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,300
It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.

688
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,010
- Snack-size gate.
- How? Why?

689
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:58,056
No idea. All I know is that something
is causing this disturbance,

690
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,893
and the last time we've seen
anything like it, it was a gate.

691
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,771
And I hope it is
because then we'd have a way to Vecna.

692
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:06,148
And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.

693
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:09,818
Where are you going?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

694
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,239
Eddie's still a wanted man.
We can't just go hike in the woods.

695
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:18,827
This little steel capsule might be the key
to saving both Max and Eddie.

696
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,164
What say you, Eddie the Banished?

697
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,628
I say you're asking me
to follow you into Mordor,

698
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,673
which, if I'm totally straight with you,

699
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,759
I think is a really bad idea.

700
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,177
But, uh, the Shire…

701
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,014
The Shire is burning.

702
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,813
So Mordor it is.

703
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,528
What is Mordor?

704
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,990
Get your stuff, dude. Let's go.

705
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,829
<i>Today,</i>

706
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,039
<i>we are going to play a game.</i>

707
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,626
<i>The rules of the game are quite simple.</i>

708
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,297
Stay in your circle.

709
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:13,965
If you leave your circle,

710
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:15,884
you lose.

711
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:19,387
<i>The last person standing in their circle</i>

712
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,974
<i>will get to spend
an extra hour of free time</i>

713
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,226
in the rainbow room.

714
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:31,733
Now, even though we are going to be
competing against one another…

715
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,318
Two.

716
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,612
Six.

717
00:43:35,695 --> 00:43:39,699
<i>…I don't want you to approach this
any differently than one of our tests.</i>

718
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:40,951
<i>Yeah?</i>

719
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,494
<i>Now, this is very important.</i>

720
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,250
If you allow anger or emotion

721
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,460
to invade your thoughts,

722
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,588
you will fail.

723
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,007
I promise.

724
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,177
Do you understand?

725
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:01,012
Yes, Papa.

726
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:03,681
Good.

727
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,356
Begin.

728
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,251
Very good, Two.

729
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,128
Number Six,

730
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,672
please,

731
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,382
take a seat by the door.

732
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,601
Five.

733
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,367
Ah!

734
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:24,847
Eleven.

735
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,744
Good luck.

736
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,335
Begin.

737
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,780
<i>He'd found his strength
in a memory from his past.</i>

738
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:24,822
Something that made him sad,

739
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,407
but also angry.

740
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,456
Do you have a memory like that?

741
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:34,916
Jane. No! No!

742
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,460
No!

743
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,400
Well, well.

744
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,862
It looks like we have a new winner.

745
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:29,637
I present you… Kyrzran.

746
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,643
You see that gray steeple over there?

747
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,311
That is Yuri's warehouse.

748
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:37,813
Looks like a church.

749
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,400
Let's see what miracles it holds, yes?

750
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,257
Oh.

751
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,010
Someone has been in my peanut butter.

752
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:12,681
Very popular, as I say, eh?

753
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,639
Weapons.

754
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,601
Where are the weapons?

755
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,610
- Oh Jesus.
- Hey. Not in a church.

756
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:28,322
You like all this?
Wait until you see my flamethrower.

757
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,034
We don't have time for show-and-tell.
We need to get going.

758
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,036
She's always this bossy?

759
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,329
You heard her.

760
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:38,916
Keys, map.

761
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,083
Let's go.

762
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:46,172
So, prison is here.

763
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,009
Between these two mountains.

764
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,927
Approximately two-hour drive.

765
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,094
I don't see anything.

766
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,264
Because it's not on the map,
but it is there.

767
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,934
How do we know
you're not leading us into some trap?

768
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,978
Because I do not need to.

769
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:05,108
You want to break into
deadliest prison in all motherland.

770
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,360
It is suicide.

771
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:09,780
Who said anything about breaking in?

772
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,407
Oh. You just expect to knock?

773
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,036
"Oh hello, let me in.
I'm friendly American with a big beard."

774
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:21,083
Something like that, actually, yes.

775
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,418
You were planning
to turn us over to the warden.

776
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,963
Today, if I'm not mistaken.

777
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,090
Ah, I see now.

778
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:30,967
I bring you in as prisoners

779
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,052
and then set you free inside walls.

780
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,681
It is risky, crazy,

781
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,891
you will still probably die,

782
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,393
yet I like it.

783
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,853
But for this to work, Yuri cannot be tied.

784
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,231
Hey, it's hard to turn over prisoners

785
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,983
when I'm a prisoner myself.

786
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,612
Hey, I think the warden
might find that suspicious.

787
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:53,197
Which is why, from here on out,

788
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,449
you're gonna be Murray.

789
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,036
And I'm gonna be Yuri.

790
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,079
I don't follow.

791
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,123
Don't worry.

792
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:07,253
It's a silent role.

793
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:09,797
Ah!

794
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,233
You want to make a fool of yourself,
go ahead.

795
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:31,110
But to bring down these men,
leaving them with no hope,

796
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:32,487
what is the purpose of that?

797
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,697
I tell them truth.
You feed their delusion.

798
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,199
Not delusions. Hope.

799
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:39,077
I believe we can fight.
I believe we can win.

800
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,786
I have a son, Mikhail.

801
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,498
I cannot leave this world with him
believing his father is a traitor.

802
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:46,001
I need to get back to him,
and I <i>will</i> get back to him.

803
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:48,128
- Is he slow?
- What?

804
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:51,255
Mikhail, your son.
Is… Is he slow? Is he stupid?

805
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:52,465
Stop talking.

806
00:50:52,548 --> 00:50:54,509
No, he's very smart. Top of his class.

807
00:50:54,592 --> 00:50:55,677
Be silent!

808
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,887
Then you're not his father.

809
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:57,929
I said go!

810
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,472
You are drunk, American.

811
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,932
I would stop speaking
unless you wish to die sooner.

812
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:04,268
I can. It doesn't matter.
I know I'm gonna die today.

813
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:07,021
But guess what?
I know who I am and what I've done,

814
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,690
unlike you and these men,

815
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:10,483
who can't face the truth.

816
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,860
That you're the reason
why we're in here. You're gonna die.

817
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:13,945
Come on, go!

818
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:16,114
Your son is not your son…

819
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:17,157
I said to be silent!

820
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,452
…and your wife...

821
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,746
Come on! Come on!

822
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:56,487
You do that again...

823
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,282
we shoot you on the spot.

824
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,452
Fools.

825
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,913
You happy now, American?

826
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,333
Was that worth it?

827
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,708
Was that worth it?

828
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,550
We call it a Demogorgon.

829
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,177
I don't know how they got it here
or what they're doing with it, but…

830
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,014
Everything I said about it's true.

831
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:25,599
Except it has one weakness.

832
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:28,394
Fire.

833
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,396
Hates fire.

834
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,233
So I figure, if we want a shot
at killing this thing,

835
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,943
we need some fuel.

836
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,987
And I need something to light it with.

837
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:44,827
So you asked me if it was worth it?

838
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,038
To answer your question…

839
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:50,666
…yeah, I think it was worth it.

840
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,672
You son of a bitch.

841
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,090
You son of a bitch.

842
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,177
Don't make me laugh.
My ribs are broken. Don't make me laugh.

843
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:15,400
Cornelius?

844
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:19,570
Cornelius?

845
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:21,114
Cornelius!

846
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,289
- Wait, where's Argyle?
- Shit, I don't know.

847
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,043
And three, two…

848
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:37,755
Oh my God.

849
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:39,048
Way to go, Cornelius.

850
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,222
Away, you mouldy rogue! Away!

851
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:49,684
And we're in.

852
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,518
Holy sh… heck.

853
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,188
Oh holy heck. You did it.

854
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,606
Hold your applause.
I don't see an address.

855
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,983
"Office." Try "office."

856
00:54:01,612 --> 00:54:03,614
What is all this?

857
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:09,119
Tanner, Tatum, out of the way!

858
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,414
Cornelius.

859
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,672
Maybe it's hidden in the code?

860
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,840
- What you just said makes no sense.
- Hold your butts. I'll trace the IP.

861
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,300
The… The I-what?

862
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,927
The internet protocol address.

863
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,722
It's a unique numerical label
given to all information technology

864
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,806
connected to the Internet.

865
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:30,934
- What's the Internet?
- Don't worry about it.

866
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:33,143
It's just gonna change the world.

867
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,070
What's happening now?

868
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:45,239
I'm running the IP
through a geolocation software.

869
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:46,949
Basically a form of data mining.

870
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:54,623
Tabitha!

871
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,418
Tabitha?

872
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,460
Tabitha. Oh no.

873
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:00,755
And cut!

874
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:04,259
Incredible. Just incredible.

875
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,594
And, Father, your terror.

876
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,887
It looked genuine.

877
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:12,934
Bingo.

878
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,976
Nevada?

879
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:15,186
Can you print this?

880
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,731
No, my skills end at IP geolocation.

881
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,030
You were being sarcastic.

882
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:25,989
Yeah.

883
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:30,534
These kids are gonna
drive me to the loony bin.

884
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,333
Hi, Father. You look like you need a nap.

885
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:41,920
Slow down!

886
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,347
Dustin's right.

887
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,681
You're a certified genius.

888
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,603
I think we just spooked a skunk.

889
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,692
<i>♪ Pass the Dutchie
'Pon the left-hand side… ♪</i>

890
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:03,693
Yo.

891
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,195
My dudes.

892
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:06,780
Any luck?

893
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:10,115
<i>♪ Give me the music
Make me jump and prance ♪</i>

894
00:56:13,827 --> 00:56:16,539
You see that, Chief? Openly mocking us.

895
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,873
Stay calm. Stay calm.

896
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:21,418
A bunch of angry, armed vigilantes
are out hunting kids,

897
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,920
openly defying us,

898
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,630
and you want me to stay calm.

899
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,715
Stay calm. Yeah.

900
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,804
<i>Hey, Chief, you copy?</i>

901
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,012
Yeah, I copy.

902
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,599
Found their station wagon
hidden up by Skull Rock.

903
00:56:35,682 --> 00:56:36,809
No sign of them though.

904
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,686
- Skull Rock?
- Yeah.

905
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:42,190
- Isn't that a make-out spot?
- And a stone's throw from Lover's Lake.

906
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,358
The hell they wanna go back there for?

907
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,195
One way to find out.
Hold tight. On our way.

908
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:04,295
Something's happening.

909
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:07,798
Dustin? Can you slow down? Dustin?

910
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,844
I think we're getting close.

911
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,054
Watch your step, big guy.

912
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:14,972
Oh man.

913
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,184
- You gotta be shitting me.
- Yeah.

914
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,688
- I thought these woods were familiar.
- Lover's Lake.

915
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:25,358
This is confounding.

916
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,443
There's a gate in Lover's Lake?

917
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,195
Whenever the Demogorgon attacked,

918
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:31,405
it always left an opening.

919
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:33,867
Maybe Vecna's the same way.

920
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,369
Yeah, only one way to find out.

921
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,251
- Easy. I… I said easy, man.
- Sorry, dude.

922
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,670
- Here you go.
- Yeah, I'm just gonna do that.

923
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,755
- Thank you.
- Yeah, that works too.

924
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,800
Good, you got her.

925
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,177
- Wheeler.
- Thanks.

926
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,181
Hey, hey, hey, you trying to sink us?

927
00:57:57,264 --> 00:57:59,809
This thing holds three people tops, okay?

928
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,769
It's better this way, okay?
You guys stay here with Max.

929
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:04,813
- Keep an eye out for trouble.
- You keep an eye out.

930
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,067
- It's my goddamn theory.
- You heard Nance.

931
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,693
- Who put her in charge?
- I did.

932
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:11,862
Compass.

933
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:18,202
Hey, there you go.

934
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,786
Ow.

935
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,456
You said three.

936
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:23,750
Sorry.

937
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,420
Bedtime at nine, kiddos.

938
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,215
Miss you already!

939
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:54,364
Please!

940
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:26,563
Please, please…

941
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:03,016
You shouldn't be
wandering the halls.

942
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,603
It's against the rules.

943
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:08,938
And not safe.

944
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,858
You shamed me today.

945
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,943
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't wanna hurt you.

946
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:17,989
You are weak

947
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:19,907
and pathetic.

948
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,119
I was holding back.

949
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,291
And then you do that before everyone?

950
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,376
Before Papa?

951
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,170
No.

952
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:43,306
How'd that feel?

953
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:45,182
Did you like that?

954
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:53,940
See a light?

955
01:00:54,858 --> 01:00:55,860
I don't.

956
01:00:57,402 --> 01:00:59,364
Something must've happened to the power.

957
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,545
Stop it! No!

958
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,880
No!

959
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:29,476
Tell Papa we did this,

960
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,230
we will kill you.

961
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,914
Aw, feeling a little dizzy there?

962
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:51,164
Poor baby.

963
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,047
<i>What have you done?</i>

964
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,885
<i>What have you done?</i>

965
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,554
Okay, easy. Deep breaths.

966
01:02:47,637 --> 01:02:49,222
Take deep breaths.

967
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:50,641
You did well, Eleven.

968
01:02:50,724 --> 01:02:51,934
You did very well.

969
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,900
I know what happened now.

970
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,030
I killed them, didn't I, Papa?

971
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:07,324
I killed them all.

972
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:08,367
Okay. Shh.

973
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,994
I killed them all.

974
01:03:23,215 --> 01:03:25,134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

975
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:26,092
Slow down, guys.

976
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,519
- Whoa.
- Wait, wait, wait.

977
01:03:37,103 --> 01:03:39,565
They're stopping.
What are they stopping for?

978
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:40,983
Guys, what's going on?

979
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,902
Come on, talk to me.

980
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:43,820
<i>What's going on?</i>

981
01:03:43,902 --> 01:03:48,490
Uh, Dustin, your compass has gone
from wonky to wonky with a capital "aah!"

982
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,869
Steve, what are you doing?

983
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,664
Somebody's gotta go down
and check this out.

984
01:03:54,746 --> 01:03:58,333
Unless one of you three can top
being a Hawkins High swim co-captain

985
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,836
and a certified lifeguard
for three years, then…

986
01:04:01,628 --> 01:04:03,922
It's gotta be me.
No complaints, all right?

987
01:04:04,923 --> 01:04:07,260
Hey, I'm not complaining.

988
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:09,302
I do not wanna go down there.

989
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,565
Ugh.

990
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,442
- When'd Steve get so hairy?
- Right?

991
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,652
I keep telling him
he needs to tame that jungle,

992
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:27,612
but he claims the ladies dig it.

993
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,867
Let me see.

994
01:04:30,949 --> 01:04:31,909
What?

995
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,213
Hey.

996
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:46,882
Good luck.

997
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:47,884
Thanks.

998
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,387
Gross.

999
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,226
Steve?

1000
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:01,063
Be careful.

1001
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:25,630
You guys realize,
if there's a gate down there,

1002
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,505
it's technically a water gate.

1003
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,260
Watergate.

1004
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,289
Where we at, Wheeler?

1005
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,248
- Closing in on a minute.
- Okay.

1006
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:06,711
Come on, Steve. Come on.

1007
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:12,385
- Down by the water!
- Shit. Down!

1008
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,344
Shit. Shit.

1009
01:06:14,427 --> 01:06:16,137
It was on this shoreline.

1010
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,594
Oh Christ!

1011
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,429
I found it.

1012
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:59,974
- You found it?
- I found it. Yeah. I found it.

1013
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:02,768
Dustin, you are a goddamn Einstein.

1014
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:05,396
<i>Steve found the gate...</i>

1015
01:07:05,478 --> 01:07:08,023
- Cops.
- Shit, shit, shit.

1016
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:09,817
We can't let 'em find Eddie.

1017
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,445
Stay with me.

1018
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:13,820
Hey, officers!

1019
01:07:13,903 --> 01:07:16,532
- Max!
- Over here! I found the killer! This way!

1020
01:07:16,614 --> 01:07:17,867
- Shit.
- Go!

1021
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:19,034
It's pretty wild.

1022
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:20,911
It's more a snack-size gate
than the mama gate,

1023
01:07:20,994 --> 01:07:23,289
but still, it's pretty damn big.

1024
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:30,880
Steve!

1025
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,967
- Steve! Steve!
- No! No!

1026
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,554
- What the hell was that, man?
- Nancy, really, what happened?

1027
01:07:39,637 --> 01:07:40,597
Jesus!

1028
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,523
Stop!

1029
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,693
Get back here, you little rats!

1030
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:57,114
Wait, wait, wait.

1031
01:07:57,197 --> 01:08:00,076
- You're not going in there, are you?
- Just wait here.

1032
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,827
- No, Nancy!
- Nancy!

1033
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:03,454
Goddamn it!

1034
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,511
Dustin! Shit.

1035
01:08:21,221 --> 01:08:22,264
Hey there.

1036
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,143
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1037
01:08:26,226 --> 01:08:28,061
What are you doing? She said wait.

1038
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,145
Yeah, I heard her.

1039
01:08:29,854 --> 01:08:30,855
She's in charge.

1040
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,108
Are you kidding me?

1041
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,109
I made that shit up.

1042
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,194
Don't you go. Don't you...

1043
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,073
Goddamn it…

1044
01:08:39,155 --> 01:08:41,199
Son of a bitch!

1045
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,034
Oh, this is so stupid.

1046
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:45,829
This is so stupid.
This is so stupid. Shit! Shit! Shit!
