1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,347
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:06,361
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,039
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,229
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,761
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:22,551
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:25,420
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,027
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,564
Blood's trounced every potential
candidate we've focus-tested.

10
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,499
You want me to run
against Sebastian Blood?

11
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:35,202
The child of Ra's al Ghul
awaits your return.

12
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,671
Tell Ra's al Ghul
that my family is off limits!

13
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:40,090
You've got to come back home.
I can't!

14
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:42,509
If they knew I was alive,
Laurel and mom,

15
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,928
they would never
stop looking for me,

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,613
and that could
get them both killed.

17
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:50,333
Thea Queen, telling me
enough is enough.

18
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,835
Now, that is rich.

19
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,788
Sara?

20
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:10,213
Welcome to
Starling City International Airport.

21
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,931
Please have
your passports ready,

22
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,300
and your customs forms
filled out.

23
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:16,636
All passengers
with departing flights

24
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:19,055
will need to show
appropriate identification

25
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:21,140
and declaration papers.

26
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,394
International passengers
are required to have a passport

27
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:27,030
and an airline
boarding pass to travel.

28
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:30,033
Business or personal,
Miss Raatko?

29
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,985
Personal.

30
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,953
All passengers are required

31
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,573
to pick up their luggage
in the baggage claim area

32
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,775
of the international
arrivals and safety.

33
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:43,162
My computer's froze.

34
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:46,449
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right back.

35
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,723
Down on the ground,
down, down!

36
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,091
Put your hands on your head!

37
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,728
I said, hands on your head,

38
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,680
lady. I will shoot you.

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,938
Aaah!

40
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:20,171
Welcome to Starling City.

41
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:24,172

43
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,790
A successful mayoral campaign
isn't about polling,

44
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,125
it isn't about fundraising
or hot button issues.

45
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,826
It's about connecting
with people.

46
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:37,795
That's why right after
we announce tomorrow, Moira,

47
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:40,748
I want to get you in front
of as many cameras as possible.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,133
Morning shows,
talk shows--

49
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:43,634
Mark, I want to help
rebuild the city,

50
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,052
not pander to it.

51
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,254
It's not pandering,
Mom. It's campaigning.

52
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,390
Let the people get
to know the real Moira Queen,

53
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:50,975
and they are going to fall
in love with you.

54
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:52,726
Speaking from
experience,

55
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,929
this man knows what he's
talking about, Moira.

56
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,480
Hmm.

57
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,735
Mr. Steel?

58
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:03,320
May I talk to you
about something?

59
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,772
I'm no longer
your boss, Felicity.

60
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:06,607
So let's make it
Walter from now on.

61
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,659
- Ok.
- Walter.

62
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,611
It's about Tempest.

63
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:14,031
Mrs. Queen's
super sketchy offshore LLC

64
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,566
you asked me
to look into last year.

65
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:17,901
I remember.

66
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,503
That's right.

67
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:23,040
So, the thing is, I left
an embedded account alert on it

68
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:26,010
so we'd know if anyone
ever accessed it again.

69
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,962
A few days ago, there was
a wire transfer made

70
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:31,765
from Tempest to a numbered account
at Starling National Bank.

71
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:34,552
Probably the campaign accountant
shutting it down.

72
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,437
Or it could be something else.

73
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,755
That is the money Mrs. Queen
used to do some really bad things.

74
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:41,358
I mean, you guys did get divorced
for pretty good reasons.

75
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:45,613
Which is not my business.

76
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,982
I'll talk to Moira
first thing.

77
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,901
And thank you
for bringing it to my attention.

78
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:53,103
Of course.

79
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:55,239
Well...

80
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,374
We're starting a campaign.

81
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,994
Oliver, can I have a word?
Yes.

82
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:03,547
I know that you
and he are friends,

83
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,500
but you'll need to end your support
for Sebastian Blood.

84
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,118
I will speak to Sebastian.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,503
Good.

86
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:14,758
Hello?

87
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:18,229
I'll be right there.

88
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:24,968
Oliver.

89
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:27,771
Mrs. Lance.

90
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,607
I came back
as soon as I heard.

91
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,312
Thanks for coming.

92
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:38,115
Hey.

93
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:40,768
How you feeling?

94
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,337
I've been better.
Don't worry, baby.

95
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:45,789
We're going to get you
all the help you need.

96
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,508
There's a great rehab
outside of Starling,

97
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,859
they got a bed
waiting for you--

98
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:51,629
Dad, I already told you.
I didn't OD.

99
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,764
I didn't take
any pills last night.

100
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,050
I swear.
Laurel...

101
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,102
The doctor wants
to check your eye.

102
00:04:58,104 --> 00:04:59,303
What happened
to her eye?

103
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,704
Minor subconjunctival
hemorrhaging.

104
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:02,139
Probably
from hitting her head

105
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,642
when she lost
consciousness.

106
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,683
You feel better, ok?

107
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,351
Thank you.

108
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:20,908
We'll be outside.
Let's go.

109
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,026
Dad.

110
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:26,847
What is it,
sweetheart?

111
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,249
Before I passed out...

112
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:32,970
The strangest thing happened.

113
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,005
I saw Sara.

114
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:38,392
I mean, I know I was
hallucinating, but I saw her.

115
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,728
She was standing
right over me.

116
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,614
I mean, I've dreamt
about her over the years,

117
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,049
but this was so much more real.

118
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,305
That's crazy, right?

119
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,112
Yeah, it's crazy.

120
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:10,794
She's been doing that
for like an hour.

121
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,001
You saw Laurel.

122
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,786
Is she going to be ok?

123
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,805
You saved her life.

124
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,657
Hey, thanks for calling me.

125
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,009
And I never did ask you--

126
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,528
how did you find me?

127
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,114
I wasn't going
to lose you again.

128
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,317
I should get going.

129
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,216
Hey, so that's it?

130
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:37,706
You're back in town
for 24 hours,

131
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,169
now you're
just going to take off again?

132
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,387
The League of Assassins
is still after me, Ollie,

133
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:43,556
and staying in town would
put my whole family at risk.

134
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:46,008
I only came because
Laurel's in trouble.

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,876
Well, she's still
in trouble, Sara.

136
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,878
Your entire family needs you.

137
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:54,099
So do I.

138
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,747
Do me a favor and dig up
a copy of Laurel's bloodwork

139
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:04,861
from the hospital, please.

140
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,078
Sure. What are we looking for?

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,696
I just want to make
sure of something.

142
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,668
It's for you.

143
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,237
Hello, Detective.

144
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,673
Put my daughter on.

145
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,741
I know she's there.

146
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:29,101
Hilton, tell the Lieutenant
that the perp

147
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,636
was practically
lawyering up

148
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:32,021
when I read him
his Miranda.

149
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:33,856
If we don't get on top
of this situation,

150
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,140
the Lieutenant is not
going to be happy--

151
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:37,026
Oh, it smells amazing, Dad.

152
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,394
Ahh, yeah.

153
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,895
Here, try one of these.
Ok.

154
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:41,480
Beautiful. No,
I'm talking to Laurel.

155
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:44,600
Quentin, hang up the phone.
Spend time with your family!

156
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:47,570
Oh, my family. You heard that,
I got to go. Bye, buddy.

157
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,489
Sorry, ladies. Our do-er hired
some dirtbag lawyer, and--

158
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,708
Says the dad whose daughter
just applied to law school.

159
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,827
That is not the kind of lawyer
that you're going to be, young lady,

160
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:56,662
because you,
you're going to be a judge

161
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,214
or you're going to be a professor,
just like your mother.

162
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:01,500
Yeah, come over to academia.
The fun never ends.

163
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,669
Dinner is at
a crucial point.

164
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,507
- Ahem!
- Hey!

165
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,342
Hi!
Sar-bear!

166
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,595
Hey!
Hi!

167
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:13,795
Hi.

168
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,065
Sara, what a surprise.
Hi, mom.

169
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,517
Please don't tell me
you got kicked out of college.

170
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,686
Oh, well, thank you for
the vote of confidence.

171
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:21,509
I had a three day weekend,

172
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,406
so I figured I'd drive down
and surprise everybody.

173
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,407
Well, you're just
in time to eat. Come here.

174
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,860
Get yourself another
plate. Come on.

175
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,946
Here you go.

176
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,206
Hi, Dad.

177
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,963
Come here.

178
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,331
I only have a minute.

179
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,002
Well, a cup of tea
is all I ask.

180
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,470
Sit down.

181
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,724
Oh, baby.

182
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:02,677
I have missed you so much.

183
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,846
How's Laurel?

184
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,531
She saw you.

185
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,250
Right before she passed out.

186
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:09,901
She thought it was,
I don't know what.

187
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:12,120
A hallucination.
Well, good.

188
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:15,490
No, baby, you don't understand.
Seeing you, it made her happy.

189
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:19,327
Dad...The league,
they're still hunting me.

190
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,546
So what, you're just going to pop back
every time one of us is in trouble?

191
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:24,633
We can't live like this,
Sara, and you can't.

192
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:27,419
It's time we started
facing things together.

193
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,434
I've had better greetings.

194
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,536
I'm sorry, I did--
I just--I didn't know

195
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,872
what you were
going to do.

196
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,824
To be honest, neither did I.

197
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:40,995
We should talk.

198
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,913
Of course.

199
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:45,399
Do we need permission
from your boyfriend?

200
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:56,460
I am Nyssa.

201
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:59,013
Daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

202
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:01,766
Heir to the demon.

203
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,317
What are you doing here?

204
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,487
Sara swore her allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

205
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:09,357
It's time for her
to return home.

206
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:12,743
That...is not going to happen.

207
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,728
Nyssa...

208
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,164
Please, would you
give us a moment?

209
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,666
Take your time.

210
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,402
Good-byes
are never easy.

211
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:24,622
Is that why
I didn't get one?

212
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,264
I can explain.

213
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:34,932
You don't have to.

214
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,618
But you're not leaving.

215
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,520
I don't trust her.

216
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,472
Then trust me.

217
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,028
Mrs. Queen?
Hmm?

218
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,714
A Miss Smoak
is here to see you.

219
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:51,198
Who?

220
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,535
Uh, me.

221
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,238
If you're looking for
Oliver, he's not here.

222
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,540
I know. I'm to see you.

223
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,892
Really? What about?

224
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:04,111
Tempest.

225
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:06,464
I flagged a large
wire transfer you made.

226
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,693
When I mentioned it to Walter,

227
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,242
he said he would
talk to you about it.

228
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,503
I could tell in his face
he wouldn't.

229
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:14,505
British people
are really bad liars.

230
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:15,973
Yes, they are.

231
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,391
So I looked into it myself,

232
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,894
because--full disclosure--

233
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,313
I--I don't trust you.

234
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:26,567
You paid a substantial
sum of money to a Dr. Gill.

235
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,486
He was the doctor
who delivered Thea,

236
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:30,237
which didn't make any sense to me.
So I went through

237
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,690
like a dozen different theories
until I remembered...

238
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:35,042
Your testimony. At trial.

239
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,095
You had an affair
with Malcolm Merlyn

240
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:42,616
one year before Thea was born.

241
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:45,786
Merlyn is Thea's father.

242
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:49,340
I can see why Walter and Oliver
have such a high appraisal

243
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,176
of your capabilities.

244
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,378
So.

245
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,131
What are you going to do
with this information?

246
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,034
Felicity.

247
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,670
I don't know.

248
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:05,105
Confronting you
in your living room

249
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:07,141
was as far
as my plan went.

250
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:13,314
I thought you
deserved the chance

251
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,849
to tell Oliver yourself. He should
hear it from you.

252
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:18,986
I'm not going to tell
my son anything.

253
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,571
And neither are you.

254
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:23,791
If you won't keep my secret
for Oliver's sake,

255
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:27,795
you should keep it
for your own.

256
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:30,247
I see the way you look at him.

257
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,583
If you tell him this,

258
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:35,219
you will rip his world apart.

259
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:38,088
And a part of him
will always blame you.

260
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,759
Oh, he'll hate me, for sure.

261
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,877
But he will hate you, too.

262
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,816
We all have to keep secrets,
Miss Smoak.

263
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,446
You look different.

264
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,398
I'm still me.

265
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,450
The Sara I know
wouldn't have betrayed us

266
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,586
and fled Nanda Parbat
under the cover of darkness.

267
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:11,088
I didn't have a choice.
The earthquake--

268
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,425
I needed to see my family,
make sure they were safe.

269
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:17,177
And so they are.

270
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,046
Come home.

271
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:21,248
I can't.

272
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,967
Look, I can't
go back, Nyssa.

273
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,135
I don't have
much of a soul left in me,

274
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:28,222
but what there is,
it can't take the killing anymore.

275
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:29,640
You swore an oath.

276
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:33,277
My father sent me here
to make sure you honor it.

277
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,313
One way or another.

278
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:42,069
We both know the real reason
why you came here.

279
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:49,660
When I found you,

280
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:51,795
you were starving,

281
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,715
and alone,
simply waiting to die.

282
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,836
The League took you in...

283
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:01,639
nursed you back to health.

284
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,726
The only reason you're alive
today is because of me.

285
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:10,648
Hey, I wasn't with you
because you saved me.

286
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,568
I was with you
because I loved you.

287
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,942
But not anymore.

288
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:30,501
Ra's listens to you.
And you can ask him to release me.

289
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,420
My father has never released
anyone from the League.

290
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,039
He released
Malcolm Merlyn.

291
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,926
An action he and the citizens
of this city dearly regret.

292
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:52,306
Do what you have to.

293
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:14,328
It's been two hours,

294
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,213
and she should have gotten back
in touch with me by now.

295
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:19,199
Felicity.

296
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:21,502
Felicity!
What?!

297
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:23,721
Sorry. What?

298
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,723
Are you ok?

299
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,758
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

300
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,594
It's just...
things in here.

301
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:31,979
The League is never
going to let me go.

302
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,230
At least if I'm halfway
around the world,

303
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,815
then I can keep
my family safe.

304
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,483
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

305
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:38,318
Just got a copy of
Laurel's bloodwork.

306
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,521
She tested negative
for drugs.

307
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,206
Well, then why did she collapse?

308
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,292
Because they found traces
of snake venom in her blood.

309
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:46,827
From a Tibetan
pit viper.

310
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,612
Wait.
So Laurel didn't OD?

311
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:50,914
She was poisoned.
She was poisoned by Nyssa,

312
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,449
who did it
to draw you back here.

313
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:54,901
And it worked.

314
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,537
My family's
in danger.

315
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:03,043
Who are you texting?
No one.

316
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:05,429
Did you meet a boy at school?

317
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:08,165
Cut it out.
Boys at school are lame.

318
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,684
Hey, how's everything
with you and Oliver?

319
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,936
Great.

320
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:15,973
We decided to start
looking at apartments together.

321
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,593
I know it's a big step, but...

322
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:22,763
We're ready. I think we'll
live together for a year,

323
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,115
engaged for another,
and then...

324
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,201
Mrs. Laurel Queen.

325
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,236
Maybe one day.

326
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:33,373
This is kind of assuming
that he's ever ready to settle down.

327
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,843
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:39,213
Well, we both know at least ten girls
that he's slept with.

329
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:41,698
Can't you just be happy for me?

330
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,117
I mean, if you met
some amazing guy

331
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,836
who wanted to spend
the rest of his life with you,

332
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,805
I would be so supportive,
and so happy for you--

333
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,624
Ok, Laurel, I wasn't trying
to be a bitch.

334
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:53,177
The title
of your autobiography.

335
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,015
I'm going to get
some sleep.

336
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,340
No!

337
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,242
No!

338
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,778
No!

339
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,865
Dad, it's my fault,
I'm so sorry.

340
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,033
The assassins group that you're
a part of, they took your mother.

341
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,018
Not exactly.

342
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,518
Well, what exactly?
A woman.

343
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,353
Nyssa. She's a powerful
figure in the League.

344
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,740
And she poisoned Laurel.
She took mom.

345
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:58,275
To get you to come back
to the League?

346
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:02,380
To get me
to come back to her.

347
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,132
Oh.

348
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:08,035
Nyssa,
don't do this.

349
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:11,255
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

350
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:13,340
I thought it would be
instructive

351
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,726
for you to know
what it feels like

352
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,377
to suddenly lose
someone you love.

353
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,397
To have them ripped
from your life without warning.

354
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,065
You do not want
to hurt my mother.

355
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,818
You're right.
I don't.

356
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,021
You have one day,
ta-er sah-fer.

357
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:29,940
Make the right choice.

358
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:37,731
We have 24 hours.

359
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,084
Detective...
We'll find her.

360
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:43,003
Ok, Laurel's inside,
she's losing her mind, I got to go.

361
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,623
Keep me updated.

362
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,627
Oh, come on!

363
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:52,713
You ought to buy a ticket
if you're going to play like that!

364
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,550
Hey, kiddo. How's
the apartment hunt going?

365
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:59,220
Terribly. I really wanted to find
the perfect place

366
00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:01,305
to show Ollie when he gets back
from his boat trip.

367
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:03,590
Everything good
was already taken

368
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,443
by the time I walked
in the door.

369
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,278
Maybe it's a sign that you're not
supposed to move in

370
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,729
with the frat boy
that you call a boyfriend.

371
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,147
You and mom were my age

372
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,932
when you moved into that
place on Spring Street.

373
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,200
You weren't even
engaged yet.

374
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:14,618
Well, that's
'cause your mother

375
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,455
kept turning down
all my proposals.

376
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,106
She did?

377
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,325
Oh, you know your mother,
free spirit and all.

378
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,226
Why do we need rings
when we have love?

379
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,688
You know I spent a year
with that damn ring

380
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:25,613
burning a hole
in my pocket?

381
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:29,283
A mayday transmission
was heard, but so far there has been

382
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,618
no trace
of the "Queen's Gambit."

383
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,505
Among those missing are local residents
Robert and Oliver Queen.

384
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,792
Do we have a lead on Dinah?

385
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,178
We researched the poison
Nyssa used on Laurel.

386
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,063
Luckily for us,
Tibetan pit viper venom

387
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:45,082
is surprisingly
difficult to transport.

388
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,852
It starts losing its potency
the moment it leaves the fangs.

389
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:50,654
Yet another sentence I never
thought I'd actually say out loud.

390
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,022
So it was bought locally?

391
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,175
Not bought. Stolen.

392
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,976
From where?
The zoo.

393
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,329
A local break-in.
The perps didn't steal anything,

394
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:00,865
so the cops chalked it up
to a bunch of kids looking for a thrill.

395
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,217
I pulled up the zoo CCTV footage
from the night of the break-in.

396
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,585
I caught a plate.

397
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,537
The car's a rental.

398
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,422
Address
is in the Glades.

399
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:10,207
Sara.
Call your father.

400
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:16,623
Sebastian, I am so sorry.

401
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,674
I have a bad habit
of standing you up.

402
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,227
Look, I know you have to pull
your support for my campaign.

403
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,846
Blood is thicker
than politics.

404
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:25,514
And it should be.

405
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,483
Well, thank you
for understanding,

406
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,318
and I really hope that this
doesn't affect our friendship.

407
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,838
It's important to me.
And to me.

408
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,024
Can I help you,
alderman?

409
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,243
Oh, I had a meeting
with your son.

410
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:39,328
I'm sure you can
guess the topic.

411
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,398
I hope my decision
to run against you for mayor

412
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,367
doesn't affect
your relationship.

413
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,786
Out of respect
for that relationship,

414
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,087
can I offer some advice?

415
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:50,256
Please.
Get out.

416
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,842
Now.

417
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:55,261
The fact that you are
advising me to get out

418
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,630
before I even announce
my candidacy

419
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:59,799
suggests that you're threatened.

420
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,668
I'm apprehensive about destroying
my friend's mother.

421
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,105
I can take care of myself.
Really?

422
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:08,307
During your trial,
you portrayed yourself

423
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,727
as a fragile creature
living under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.

424
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:13,112
So which is it?

425
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,781
The woman strong enough
to lead this city,

426
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:19,168
or the one too weak
willed to save it?

427
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,122
The one who should not be
underestimated.

428
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,385
So what exactly
is the plan here?

429
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:40,089
We wait. The Arrow
will lead him right to us.

430
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,426
You know,
you never did tell me

431
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:44,894
how you joined up
with the Arrow in the first place.

432
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,095
Where did you two
even meet?

433
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,731
Vigilante club.

434
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,266
Same old Sara.

435
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:53,853
Well, not exactly
the same.

436
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:56,939
I loved her, Dad.

437
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:02,495
Are you upset?

438
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:04,997
Honestly, Sara,

439
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,449
to think what
you've been through

440
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,950
these past six years?

441
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,586
The pain,
the loneliness...

442
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:14,123
I'm just happy to hear you
had someone that cared for you.

443
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,196
What's the matter,
they didn't teach you

444
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,365
about right crosses
in assassin school?

445
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,984
Where is Nyssa?!
Tell me where my wife is!

446
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:46,806
What the hell is he saying?
He's praying.

447
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:49,291
No, don't!

448
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:52,211
Son of a bitch!

449
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,216
It's over, Detective.

450
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,919
He's gone.

451
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:12,237
How's Sara
holding up?

452
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,905
Not well.
And I need you

453
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:15,223
to pick up
the trail on Nyssa,

454
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:16,992
because Mrs. Lance
is running out of time.

455
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:18,777
I'm on it.

456
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,113
Oh, Oliver.

457
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:23,448
Felicity.
Hi, hi.

458
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,451
Ohh. Well, I haven't
been this nervous

459
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:28,236
since my wedding day.

460
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:31,139
Both of them.
Moira, it's time.

461
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,175
Oliver, are you ready to introduce
your mother?

462
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,626
With pride.

463
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,635
Felicity?

464
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,086
Felicity.

465
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,255
What is going on
with you?

466
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,473
And don't say--
nothing.

467
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:50,642
Don't say "nothing."

468
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:54,012
The truth, please.

469
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:57,332
Might have noticed
that I talk a lot.

470
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:58,917
It has not escaped
my attention.

471
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,969
You might have also noticed
that I don't talk a lot

472
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:03,622
about my family.
I have noticed that.

473
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:07,025
My mother is...

474
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:10,212
She's...

475
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:12,164
She's my mother.

476
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,665
And...

477
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:16,802
I don't really know
what my father is,

478
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:18,503
'cause he abandoned us.

479
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:20,589
I barely remember him.

480
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:22,340
But I do remember...

481
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:25,327
How much it hurt
when he left.

482
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,178
And just the thought
of losing someone

483
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:29,682
that important to me again...

484
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:31,683
Hey.

485
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:33,351
You're not going
to lose me.

486
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:36,188
Whatever it is
that's bothering you...

487
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,774
Is it about
your family?

488
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,211
No.

489
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:45,697
It's about yours.

490
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,786
Time's up.

491
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:54,206
Have you made your decision?

492
00:26:57,343 --> 00:27:00,828
Let my mother go.

493
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,298
And I will return with you
to Nanda Parbat.

494
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:07,886
You're doing
the right thing, Sara.

495
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:10,272
For both of us.

496
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:22,183
Here you go,
sweetie.

497
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:24,903
Your chamomile,
like you like.

498
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:27,656
Is there anything else
I can get you?

499
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:29,958
My mother.

500
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:35,463
Laurel, there's
something I got to tell you.

501
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,835
It's about
your sister.

502
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:43,088
What about her?

503
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,182
Hello?

504
00:27:54,184 --> 00:27:55,901
Dad, I found mom.

505
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:58,186
Meet me at the lower boat
yards in 30 minutes,

506
00:27:58,188 --> 00:27:59,688
and come alone.

507
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,356
Don't tell the Arrow.

508
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:02,890
Copy that.

509
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,443
I got to go.

510
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,329
What about Sara, Dad?

511
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:08,947
I'll explain everything
later, all right?

512
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:11,917
Just sit tight.

513
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,342
I say this
with confidence.

514
00:28:20,344 --> 00:28:22,677
Because the Moira Queen
that I know is more

515
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,580
than a successful CEO
and philanthropist.

516
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:28,016
She is a loving mother
who has devoted her life

517
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,752
to raising
two wonderful children.

518
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:32,771
Just to tell you
how special she is,

519
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,589
I'd like to welcome her son.

520
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:38,393
CEO of Queen Consolidated,
Mr. Oliver Queen.

521
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,377
Phew. Thank you.

522
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,501
Well, I'm here today
to say a few words...

523
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:08,006
about Moira Queen.

524
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:12,744
I bet many of you
think that you know her,

525
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:14,796
because you...

526
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,650
read about her
in the press,

527
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:21,686
or you saw her on TV.

528
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:25,840
But I can promise you...

529
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,578
You don't know my mother.

530
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,704
You don't know her
like I do.

531
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:52,217
And you don't know
what she's capable of...

532
00:29:56,856 --> 00:30:00,308
When it comes to helping

533
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,611
the people of Starling City.

534
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,197
Ladies and gentlemen...

535
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,033
My mother,

536
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,651
Moira Queen.

537
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:13,988
I know.

538
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:20,962
Thank you!

539
00:30:20,964 --> 00:30:24,299
Thank you, Starling City.

540
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:25,583
Sara!

541
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,336
The snake venom,
it's gone.

542
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,055
She found Nyssa.

543
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:31,539
And she's going
to poison her?

544
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:32,841
We need to stop her
before she does.

545
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:34,509
Activate her tracer.

546
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,094
You put a tracer on her?

547
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:37,879
She has a bad habit
of disappearing on me.

548
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,265
Oliver, I hate to sound cold,
but why do we care

549
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,734
if Sara kills some bad ass assassin
that wants to get her and her family?

550
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,737
Because, Diggle,
if half of the stories

551
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:49,007
that I have heard
about Ra's al Ghul are true,

552
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,910
if Sara kills his daughter...

553
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:54,746
We will all pay.

554
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,908
They're coming for you now.

555
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,294
Dinah! Move away
from her! Move away!

556
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:11,596
It's all right,
it's all right.

557
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,598
What's happening?

558
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:18,636
Sara...

559
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:20,054
It's me, Mom.

560
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:21,973
It's me.

561
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:28,213
Oh, my baby!

562
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:31,116
My baby!

563
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:34,652
Oh, my baby!

564
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:38,206
I love you so much, Mom.

565
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,041
I have to go.

566
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,127
What? What
are you doing?

567
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:44,212
Dad, get mom out of here!
What?!

568
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:46,714
We've got to go.
No!

569
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,167
No!

570
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:51,920
No!

571
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,349
You took the poison.

572
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:07,485
No!

573
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,892
No!

574
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:17,028
No!

575
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:20,993
I can't go back.

576
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:23,804
I can't take
the killing anymore.

577
00:32:24,206 --> 00:32:26,372
It needs to end.

578
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,824
Sara! Delta Charlie 52,
to Central,

579
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:30,927
need back up at
the lower boat yards.

580
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,295
Ambulance, paramedics...

581
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,166
If you want to be with
your family so badly,

582
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:40,603
they can join you
in eternity.

583
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:45,058
You get the hell away
from my daughter.

584
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,983
Live or die.

585
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:56,286
It's up to you.

586
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:31,404
Sara. I can still save her.

587
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:33,690
Worry more
about saving yourself.

588
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:54,344
Don't kill her.

589
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,929
Please.

590
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:59,215
Sara...

591
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,637
Sara!

592
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:07,523
Sara, hold on.

593
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,560
Stay with me.
Come on.

594
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:14,030
Come on, stay.

595
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,568
Not again.

596
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:32,498
No more killing.

597
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,083
Nyssa.

598
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,219
Please.

599
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,641
Ta-er sah-fer,

600
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:45,678
in the name
of Ra's al Ghul...

601
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,148
I release you.

602
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:58,358
Thank God you're ok!

603
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,827
Are you all right?

604
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,246
Oh, I can't believe you.

605
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:07,834
Look at you.
You're all right, baby.

606
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:10,837
I can't believe it.
Look at you.

607
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:13,423
You're ok, baby.

608
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,692
Because Starling City
is our city.

609
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:29,747
And starting today,
we're going to take it back.

610
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:39,556
I know we need to talk.

611
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:41,057
You need to listen.

612
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,178
For the past year,

613
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,315
I have stood by your side...

614
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,901
And I have fought,

615
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:54,771
because I wanted to believe
that you weren't this...

616
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,391
Monster.

617
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,662
And I needed to believe
that I still had a mother.

618
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,781
You do, Oliver--

619
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:07,634
Oliver, I only lied about Thea
to protect her from Malcolm.

620
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:11,171
No, you lied
because that is what you do.

621
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:14,925
And that is who you are, Mom.

622
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,660
Lies.

623
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:21,681
And now you've made
a liar out of me.

624
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:25,719
Because Thea could never
find out about Merlyn.

625
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:29,189
And she could never
know the truth about us.

626
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:34,227
Which is that as of right now,
we have no relationship.

627
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:39,533
I will keep up appearances
for Thea's sake.

628
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:44,287
And publicly, I will
support your campaign.

629
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,706
But privately...

630
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:50,410
You and I are done.

631
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,262
Oliver...

632
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:53,552
Oliver.

633
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:59,469
Oliver!

634
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:12,899
I know you have
a lot of questions.

635
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,202
Nope.

636
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:16,903
How could you not
have any questions?

637
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:21,191
Because I already know
all of the answers to them.

638
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:24,077
How could you still be alive;

639
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,795
where have you been
all this time?

640
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:28,565
Why didn't you call us.

641
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:32,752
And the answer
to all of them...

642
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:35,338
Is because it's Sara.

643
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,090
Baby, don't do this--

644
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,342
Dad, I swear to God,
if you say one more word.

645
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:42,095
Laurel, look,
I know you're angry.

646
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:45,298
And you have
every right to be.

647
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,601
But please don't
take this out on dad.

648
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:49,719
If you need someone
to blame, blame me.

649
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:51,955
Oh, I do blame you, Sara.

650
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:54,307
Every single thing
that's gone wrong in our lives

651
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,860
is your fault.

652
00:37:56,862 --> 00:38:01,147
You got on that stupid boat
with my boyfriend.

653
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:03,733
You didn't call us to tell us
that you were still alive,

654
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:07,287
even though it probably would
have saved mom and dad's marriage.

655
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,540
And you brought some crazy assassin
into Starling City

656
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:14,244
who nearly killed mom
and who poisoned me.

657
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:15,996
You.

658
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:20,000
You stole my whole life
away from me.

659
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,971
Now get out.
Laurel...

660
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,057
Get out.

661
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,022
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:43,690
I said get out!

663
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:46,159
Hold on.

664
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:56,202
Please, come in.

665
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,961
Tell me Oliver is ok!

666
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,597
Tell me everything's ok!

667
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,349
I wish I could.

668
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:12,102
Moira, I'm so sorry about Robert.
About Oliver.

669
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:14,671
I really am.

670
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:20,093
Yes, um, I need
to tell you both something.

671
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:22,395
What is it?

672
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,870
Robert and Oliver
weren't the only ones lost.

673
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:34,240
Along with the crew,

674
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:36,209
a friend

675
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:39,245
invited along by Oliver
at the last minute.

676
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,831
Tommy.
No.

677
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,118
It was...

678
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,388
It was Sara.

679
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,807
Your Sara.

680
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,843
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

681
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:59,399
The dock master
saw her sneak on board.

682
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:04,404
With Moira Queen's
impressive speech

683
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:06,106
earlier today, some pundits

684
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:09,109
are suggesting her candidacy
might not be so far-fetched.

685
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,828
And while Blood's campaign has yet
to issue a public response

686
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,363
to Mrs. Queen's announcement...

687
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:16,666
I warned you not
to underestimate Moira Queen.

688
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:18,535
What do you want me to do?

689
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:21,371
Thank you!

690
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:24,290
Thank you, Starling City!

691
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:27,010
Nothing.

692
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,765
I'll take care of it.

693
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,032
You've been crying.

694
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,317
Yeah, I was happy
to know I still could.

695
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,253
Are you ok?

696
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:57,657
Well, Laurel wasn't as thrilled
to see me as you thought.

697
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,543
Give her time.

698
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:04,214
I gave her six years.

699
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,852
What exactly are you
taking out on that dummy?

700
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:13,223
My mother...

701
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,429
She's not who
I thought she was.

702
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:22,565
I guess it's going around.

703
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,569
So what now?

704
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:30,673
I don't know.

705
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:33,910
I don't, either.

706
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,263
I know one thing.

707
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,593
What's that?

708
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:42,345
I'm home.

709
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:55,522
