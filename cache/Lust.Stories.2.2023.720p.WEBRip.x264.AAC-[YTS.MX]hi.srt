00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,375
[Cheeku] Babi, when we used
to go to shopping,

5
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,333
he would look at the embroidery
instead of the clothes.

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,875
He still does it.

7
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,125
[Cheeku] Actually, he thought
he could impress girls with that.

8
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,500
-Look at her.
-[all laugh]

00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,917
This is too much. [chuckles]

-[Dabbu] Aha! Samosas.
-[upbeat instrumental music playing]

11
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,667
Wow. Looks good.

12
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,708
Arrey, if you do all this,

13
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,500
then I won't
let you both get married.

14
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,667
Arrey, his hands work too.
He can serve himself.

15
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,583
If you start serving him now,

16
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,375
then he will boss you around forever.
[chuckles]

17
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
-Arrey yaar. Cheeku?
-[Cheeku] Yes?

18
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,292
-I will help myself.
-Where is Maji?

19
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,750
She'll be here soon.

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,667
You know, two hours after sunrise

21
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,833
and two hours before sunset,
even if someone dies,

22
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,167
Maji won't stop her Maataji's prayers.

23

[all laugh]

24
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,375
Don't say that.

25
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,667
Move away from the samosas.

26
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,833
Put it down. Give it. Leave the samosa.

27
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:26,917
Uh…

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,375
-[sighs] Give it to me.
-That's for you.

29
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,375

[retches]

31
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,708
Did you put sugar in it?

32
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,208
Not sugar, Dadi. I've put sweet potato.

33
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,083
-Hmm.
-It's healthy. You can eat them.

34
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,542
If I can't even eat them,
how will they be good for my health?

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,083
Do you hate potatoes, huh?

36
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,708
We don't hate them, Dadi, really.

37
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,833
Anyone who eats potatoes
ends up becoming one.

38
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,958
[all laugh]

39
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,375
They are made for each other.

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,958
Arrey, even as a kid, he used to take
the potatoes out of his parathas

41
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,583
and just eat them plain.

42
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:12,000
By the way, why this new generation
is so obsessed with fitness,

43
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,750
-I just don't understand.
-Ma.

44
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,292
Not only anti-potato.

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,500
I guess these two have a lot in common.

46
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,625
Yeah, I mean, three months of talking
and walking together is paying off.

47
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,958
[laughs]

48
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,917
[Cheeku] Babiji, we can never know
what the universe has planned

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
for all of us.

50
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,833
It's crazy how Dabbu and I
saw each other after 12 years,

51
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,708
and then he convinced me
to come to your place for some chai,

52
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,458
and before we could even finish our chai,

53
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,583
Arjun came home.

54
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:41,833
Who knew that, instead of vegetables,
I would bring an in-law?

55
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,333
Here I was matching their horoscopes

56
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:50,125
and they were both busy finding out
every little thing about each other.

57
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,125
Sufi songs, Chinese food,

58
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,958
traveling the world, going on treks,

59
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,000
becoming CEOs. [chuckles]
All the same things.

60
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,375
-Mama, stop it, please.
-Arrey, why stop it?

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,667
What's wrong with talking

62
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,542
-about things with the family?
-[Dabbu] Mm!

63
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,667
You know, I really think
that you two are so lucky, that…

64
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,125
you are so compatible together.

65
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,000
[Rina] You better say yes soon, bhaisaab.

66
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,667
If our boy grabs your dear daughter
and runs off with her in a Rajdhani,

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,875
then please don't complain to us.

68
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,583
Arrey, I think we should
let them run away.

69
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,917
We will save some money.

70

00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,167

-Uh, sorry.
-Have you had sex?

Have you done it?

-Tell me.
-Hmm?

77
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,625
Mom!

78
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,708
What is this nonsense?

79
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,750
The reason you were born
is because of this nonsense.

80
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,292
-You all are nonsensical.
-Dadi…

81
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,875
Veda, we are talking
about marriage here, so I asked.

82
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,458
Before you even buy a small car,
you test drive it, right?

83
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,625
[music resumes]

84
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,708
Yeah.

85
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,542
So no test drive before marriage?

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,958
[Dadi] This is marriage, beta.

87
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,542
This is what will drive your entire life.

88
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,792
Sorry.

89
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,667
Maji, I think
you're not feeling well. Come.

90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,333
[Rina] No, no, let her speak.

91
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,500
-Do you think our son can't do it?
-Yes.

92
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,792
-Cheeku, yaar, what is this?
-I'm… I'm…

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,583
-Dadi, we are getting married.
-That's why I said all this.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,208
[music concludes]

95
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,792
And you all should also wonder
about my granddaughter.

96
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,292
Forget about us.

97
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:53,750
They both should wonder
if they are compatible or not

-inside the bedroom.
-[chuckles]

99
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,208
It's really good.

100
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,125
It's really good that they both like
Chinese food, very good.

101
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,250
But for how long will noodles
keep them together?

102
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:14,083
After working hard to reach
the position of CEO,

103
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,750
what will make them
want each other at home?

104
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,042
To listen to Sufi music?

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Or to plan their trekking trip?

106
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,417
[clicks tongue]

107
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,083
No.

108
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,458
Even if their horoscopes
don't match perfectly,

109
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,625
if the sex is satisfying,

110
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,875
then they both will never,
ever leave each other.

You are so funny, Dadi.

-No, no.

I wasn't joking.

Dadi! Like a nuclear attack happened.

You know, one blast rocked two homes.

You should have seen their faces!

Yes, poor them…

Here.

00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,292
That's the problem with the world.

-All think poorly.
-[Veda] Hmm.

132

How is Arjun?

00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,292
He's fine. He's cool.

134

He just couldn't stop…
[chuckles] …laughing about it.

135
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,417
Not reaction, Veda.
I'm asking about action.

-How's he?

138

-I'll… I'll find out and let you know.
-Hurry.

139
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,875
Hurry? What's the hurry, Dadi?

140

So…

141
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,875
you're not in a hurry?

142
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,750
[sighs] This means you both
are not made for each other.

143
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,875
Everything is not about sex, okay?

144
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,792
And I am--

145
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:39,083
I'm not that inexperienced.
I know. I… I have had boyfriends.

marriage is something else only.

149
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,167
What I'm actually saying to you,
that you should marry the person

150
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,958
with whom the sex is good.

151
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:59,417
Rather what I want to say is the person
you finally marry…

152
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,375
make sure…

153
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,542
the sex is amazing with him.

why didn't I see
this side of you before?

157
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,542
Dadi, you are so passionate,
you are so sexy.

158
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,542
You're such a rock star, Dadi.

If your dadu hadn't died at such
a young age, you know,

I'm doing it with my husband.

643
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,667
Not like you,
looking at others and enjoying it.

644
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,292
-God, you are such a dirty woman.
-I'm dirty?

645
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:11,667
What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?

646
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,667
I'm dirty? Huh?

647
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,042
You are the one lying naked
on my bed and messing around.

648
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,250
-And I'm dirty?
-[Kamal] Sor-- Sor-- Sorry, madam.

649
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,083
-Uh, please--
-You wanna sleep with your man, right?

650
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,583
Then go and do it in your house.

651
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:26,417
-I trusted you with my house keys.
-[Kamal] Please let it go, madam.

652
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,375
-And you used it to--
-What exactly did I use your keys for?

653
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,083
Did I steal anything from your house?

654
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,750
-[Isheeta] One minute--
-You gave me the keys for work.

655
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,292
Because you can't wake up and open
the bloody door!

656
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:35,917
-[Isheeta] Keep your voice down.
-[Seema] Why should I?

657
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,372
Can you tell her to keep her voice down?

658
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,156
You gave me the keys
so I could look after your house!

659
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,000
[Isheeta] Stop shouting!

660
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,464
Do you even know
where your things are kept?

661
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:42,667
I'm the one who washes your underwear.

662
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,000
Seema, what the hell are you saying?
Please.

663
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,500
What do you mean by that? It's her house
so she can say whatever she wants?

664
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,208
You are not bloody working here
for free, okay?

665
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,500
I pay you a salary for it!

666
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,292
And you…

667
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,000
did you ask for my permission
before you came up?

668
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:57,542
Did you ask me?

669
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,542
You tell me, how do I know
who all she brings to my house, huh?

670
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,083
-I don't know.
-What did you just say?

671
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,708
-Hey! Stop it!
-Have you gone mad, huh?

672
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,958
-Or else I'll call the police, okay?
-You wanna call the police? Call them.

673
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:08,667
-So-- Sorry, madam. Please.
-Why you say sorry to her?

674
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,667
Did you hear what she said?

675
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,375
That I'm sleeping around with people
and you are saying,

676
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:12,500
"Sorry, sorry, sorry" to her?

677
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:13,792
-Huh?
-Just calm down!

678
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:15,708
She was watching us from there.
She was watching both of us

679
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:16,917
-from that mirror.
-What?

680
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,708
I will look at you?

681
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:23,250
-So who are you looking at?
-I will look at you?

682
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,792
Even thinking about it is disgusting!

683
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,250
Disgusting for me.

684
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,208
Huh. Really, Didi?

685
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,125
Now I disgust you? I disgust you?

686
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:37,583
Food, clothes, dishes, I do everything
and now you are disgusted by me?

687
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,083
You did not feel disgusted

688
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,875
when I cleaned your house
like it was my own.

689
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,917
You did not feel disgusted then.

690
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:45,417
Can you do a single thing without my help?

691
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,042
You can't even get yourself a man.

692
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,000
Even to cool yourself,
you bloody need me horny!

693
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,500
-Seema!
-Get out!

694
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,833
-[Kamal] Seema, stop this nonsense!
-Get out of my house.

695
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,833
Take whatever I owe you and just leave.

696
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:56,292
-Get out.
-[Seema] Kamal, wait.

697
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,500
Give me that.

698
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,375
Take your keys back.

699
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,833
I don't want this job.

700
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:03,250
I don't need your money.

701
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,208
I'll find work at ten other places! Ha!

702
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,042
No one in this building will hire you.

703
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,125
I will tell everyone in the society

704
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,000
how you were naked on my bed
and were fucking around!

705
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,292
Okay, so tell them.

706
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,792
You think I'll keep quiet?

707
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,917
I have seen everything with my own eyes.

708
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,833
How you sneak into the house like a mouse
every day and hide behind the tree

709
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:24,125
to watch us
and touch yourself every fucking day!

710
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,125
And you think people are
gonna believe you?

711
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,333
You?

712
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,542
Fuck off!

713
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,583
[door slams]

714
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:42,958
Akkash, take this.

715
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,542
Bring back the change, yeah?

716
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,250
I am leaving now.

717
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:56,417
Arrey, don't you have
to go to work today?

718
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,083
I will.

719

[doorbell rings]

720
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,250
Didi, today again, you're late for work?

721
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,500
-Sorry, Didi, there was no water at home.
-[Isheeta] Okay, okay.

722
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,167
Just come inside and wash the dishes,
I'm getting very late for work.

723
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,458
And please don't forget to clean
the fans on Sunday.

724
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,833
Accha, Didi.

725
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,542
Seema was working with you
for a very long time, right?

726
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,500
Why did she leave?

727

-[sighs]
-[doorbell rings]

728
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,292
-Watchman said you wanted a maid?
-[man] Yes.

729
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,292
Only for the dishes and cooking.

730
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,333
And also, I'm a vegan.

731
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,667
So don't use milk and curd.

732
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,833
-And not too much masala.
-Okay.

733
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,583
Can you come at 9:00 tomorrow?

734
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:45,917
Sure. I will.

735
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,458
[man] Thank you.

736
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,583
What?

737
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,458
[Sameera] You didn't fire Seema that day?

738
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,000
-Actually, I was, uh--
-[Sameera] Babe!

739
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:58,417
You know, I've been hearing
all sorts of crazy things.

740
00:52:58,792 --> 00:52:59,667
Meaning?

741
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,167
[Sameera] So your seventh-floor neighbor
was in my Bandra Mom's group, you know?

742
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,625
-She's been saying, like, crazy--
-What's she been saying?

743
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,417
[Sameera] She's been saying
that you've been making your maid

744
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,083
-do stuff and watching and all.
-[Isheeta] What?

745
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,000
[Sameera] Yeah. And then, apparently,
she was asking for money also.

746
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,750
But then you guys
have had some big fight

747
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,042
-and everybody in the building heard.
-What did you say?

748
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,625
[Sameera] Babe, I didn't
even know want to say.

749
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,208
Because I haven't even spoken to you.

750
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:24,042
You've just ghosted me, and I think--

751
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,000
I mean, did you even fire her?

752
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:27,542
Sammy, are you nuts?

753
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,958
I fired her and I didn't call you
because I've been busy at work.

754
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,167
[Sameera] You know, Ish,
there's been something on my mind.

755
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,458
And I really wanna ask you.

756
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,500
-So I'm just gonna go ahead and ask you.
-Yeah.

757
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,333
[Sameera] You know
when you and I used to live together

758
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,000
and Rohan used to come over?

759
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,625
You, by any chance,
didn't watch Rohan and me--

760
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,750
No.

761
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:49,083
-And how can you even ask me this, Sammy?
-[Sameera] Sorry, sorry.

762
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,875
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye.

[scoffs] Our Anu?

1120
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:38,417
Wow. So you got married to Anu?

1121
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,583
[Vijay] Everything happened so fast.

1122
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,875
After I lost you, I was a mess.

1123
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,458
And she was there for me.

1124
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,958
Kids?

1125
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,167
Two. Boys. Eight and five.

1126
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,042
So sweet.

1127
01:19:55,667 --> 01:20:00,083
I still remember when you and Anu
had joined that company together.

1128
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,542
What was that term?

1129
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,875
Graduate management trainees.

1130
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:10,208
The first time that Anu had come home…

1131
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,208
I thought she was
the prettiest girl in the world.

1132
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:16,833
Is it…

1133
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,583
jealousy?

1134
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,125
At first, I was,

1135
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,208
but I was sure that you were only mine

1136
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,583
and I had a marriage certificate
to prove it too.

1137
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:34,875
You're right.

1138
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,167
I have always been only yours.

1139
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:38,792
Nice tea.

1140
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:41,708
And I still am.

1141
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:48,417
Well, I can see you've changed a lot.

1142
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:52,625
What happened to Anu's fiancé?

1143
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,250
The one who was gonna take over
the company after their wedding?

1144
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,208
Uh… no idea.

1145
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,958
I only met him a couple of times.

1146
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,750
One of those times we met him together.
Remember?

1147
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:06,125
Then who's running the company now?

1148
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:07,875
Oh, hello.

1149
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:12,167
He's standing right in front of you.

1150
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:15,417
I'm so proud of you.

1151
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,958
You've been wanting this
since you were in college.

1152
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:20,458
And now look, you got it.

1153
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,000
But it wouldn't
have been possible without you.

1154
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:26,125
You've made so many sacrifices.

1155
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,458
-Took care of the house so that I could--
-No.

1156
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,833
Taking care of the house was my choice.

1157
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,042
It made me happy.

1158
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,167
Whatever I am today, it's because of you.

1159
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:39,708
Thank you.

1160
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,417
Mmm, Vijay!

1161
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:48,833
You just haven't changed at all.

1162
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,458
Jump at the first chance you get.

1163
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,542
How does Anu keep up with you?

1164
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,000
Very happily.

1165
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,583
[Shanti] You should leave now.

1166
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,125
You're getting really late.

1167
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah, I am getting late.

1168
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:09,542
Listen, you are coming back with me.

1169
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,208
Why? No.

1170
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:13,500
Why not?

1171
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,042
Do you know how happy Anu
will be when she sees you?

1172
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:18,958
[tense music playing]

1173
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:20,208
She won't be.

1174
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:22,125
Why?

1175
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,500
You still haven't realized it, Vijay?

1176
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,375
It was Anu.

1177
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,833
What was Anu?

1178
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,292
She was the one who hired those people.

1179
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,583
The couple.

1180
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:35,000
The one I met outside the nursing home.

1181
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,125
The one that had tried to kill me.

1182
01:22:37,208 --> 01:22:38,667
What the hell are you saying?

1183
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,250
Are you out of your mind?

1184
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,042
Anu has loved you for a long time.

1185
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,375
No. No, Shanti.

1186
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:48,583
The three of us
were the best of friends, man.

1187
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:50,500
The three fucking musketeers.

1188
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,292
Anu always wanted you for herself.

1189
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,625
She always tried
to keep you distracted from me.

1190
01:22:56,917 --> 01:23:00,000
And the day that she found out
I was pregnant, she tried to--

1191
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:01,250
Wh-- wha-- One minute.

1192
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:04,000
How did Anu find out
that you were pregnant, huh?

1193
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,792
She never said anything to me about it.

1194
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,083
What would she have said anyway?

1195
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:11,500
Do you remember that evening
when we had that party at home

1196
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:14,083
and we were singing
"Jab Koi Baat Bigad Jaye" together?

1197
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,500
No, but go on.

1198
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,042
I had taken the test that evening,

1199
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:21,292
and by mistake,
I left the test kit in the washroom.

1200
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,708
I didn't want anyone to know about it,
so I went right back to get it.

1201
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:28,792
And I saw that Anu
was leaving the washroom.

1202
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,292
-[Vijay] So?
-[Shanti] So, Vijay,

1203
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:33,875
I had kept the test kit facing upwards,

1204
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:36,958
and when I went back
it was facing downwards,

1205
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:40,292
which means that Anu saw it
and kept it back the wrong way by mistake.

1206
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,500
Yeah. So, even if she did see…

1207
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:49,208
Fuck.

1208
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:53,542
Actually, after you were gone,

1209
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:56,042
Anu didn't even let me
out of her sight for a second.

1210
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:01,042
I thought she was
genuinely concerned, but…

1211
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,292
It costs a lot of money
to do something like this.

1212
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:06,750
And Anu had a lot of money.

1213
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:10,750
-We need to do something about this.
-No, we don't.

1214
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:11,917
Sorry?

1215
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,208
You're happy, right, Vijay?

1216
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,292
With Anu and your lovely kids?

1217
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:18,833
Yes.

1218
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,083
Then that's it.

1219
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:23,833
Just go back to your home,
back to your family.

1220
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,458
You still have time.

1221
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,375
-So please go away from here.
-And just forget about this?

1222
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,292
Everything that you've just told me?

1223
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,042
You'll have to try.

1224
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,542
Or else your life will become hell.

1225
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,250
Listen to what I'm saying.

1226
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,875
Please go away from here.

1227
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,792
I know it was a long time ago,

1228
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:46,375
but do you remember
what that couple looked like?

1229
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,583
Yes.

1230
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,292
Seriously, even now?

1231
01:24:50,917 --> 01:24:52,625
Like it was yesterday.

1232
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,042
Super.

1233
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:58,667
If we can find them,
then we can find out what happened.

1234
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,833
We will find the truth.

1235
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:02,750
[scoffs] And what will you do
with the truth?

1236
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,583
And what if Anu
really was behind all this?

1237
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,125
Then she will have to be punished.

1238
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,417
And then?

1239
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:12,375
Then maybe…

1240
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:15,958
we can be together again.

1241
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,458
I missed you so much.

1242
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,167
No, no, we can't.

1243
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,208
Will you please leave from here?

1244
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:29,375
-You have a wife now.
-Because of whom, I lost you.

1245
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,208
[Shanti] We can't do this.

1246
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:33,750
Please go away.

1247
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:36,292
Listen, I'm with Inder now.

1248
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,833
[dramatic music playing]

1249
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:57,708
You were always like this or what?

1250
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:59,125
Will you focus first?

1251
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:03,208
[music continues]

[grunting]

1256

Vijay, careful. Be careful.

[soft instrumental music playing]

1260

-Vijay, did you just--
-Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

1261
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,167
Last time that you couldn't help yourself,

1262
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,042
you remember I got pregnant?

1263
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,542
And then I ended up here.

1264
01:27:32,042 --> 01:27:34,000
Don't worry, you won't get pregnant.

1265
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,708
How do you know that?

1266
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,333
I just know it.

1267
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,833
And if you want to be sure,
then try your Red Blue again.

1268
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:43,000
You'll find out yourself.

1269
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,708
Same old Vijay.

1270
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:49,208
-"I know everything."
-[chuckles]

1271
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,333
Correct.

1272
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,625
Red Blue?

1273
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,208
How do you know that?

1274
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:04,667
What Red Blue?

1275
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,542
[Shanti] The test kit.

1276
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,792
The one that Anu saw,

1277
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:10,917
it's called Red Blue.

1278
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:15,208
It's not available anywhere in India.

1279
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:17,833
My friend from Canada bought it for me.

1280
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:20,125

[man] Yeah, it's me.
I'll show you, bitch!

1444

Get out from here! Get out, you harami!

-Should I come? Should I?

Anyway, you tell me, what's the matter?

1457
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:07,000
Are you still not getting better?

1458

There is absolutely nothing left in me.

How are you doing?

1460
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:13,750
[Chanda] I'm okay.

-I'm just missing you.
-[laughs]

1462

Yes. I know exactly.

1463
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:23,042
Why do you miss me now?

1464
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:26,208
Because you were a queen here.

[laughs, coughs]

can make my son a king then…

01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:40,917
I'm fine with that.

1470
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:44,417
Did you go to the doctor?

1471
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:46,750
What will a doctor do? Huh?

1472
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,250

It's actually good
that you left this place.

1476

Just yesterday, I found out that
one of our girls has got the disease.

1477

Don't know which horrible fucker
gave this to her.

Listen, come here.

If my son gets less marks this time,

Asking about the stars.

Told him they're not favorable.

1497

I hope you've studied well.

1498

No black clothes, black shoes,
black shirt, avoid wearing anything black.

You know what? Right now,
your stars are waiting to attack you.

Need to avert them.

This is usually done
at a place in Ujjain.

But can get it done for 1,100 rupees.

Don't worry.

1542

[Yuvraj] And?

First thing every morning,
feed roti to a dog,

vegetables to a crow,
and sugar to five ants.

Rahu is setting foot in his chart.

This can be fixed in Banaras,

As long as you live in this haveli,
no England for you.

So how do I calm down Shukra?

The old one was doing fine.
Why did you fire her?

I didn't fire her. She ran away.

What was the problem?

01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,542
[in English] Leave me! Asshole!

1603
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,375
You dare talk back to me, madarchod?

1604
01:52:58,125 --> 01:53:01,458
Your mother used to be
a cow dung collector, madarchod!

Fuck!

1611
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:34,125
Nothing ever works in this house.

01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
Hmm? Where did you learn from?

01:55:34,667 --> 01:55:36,417
I didn't learn it, hukum.

1630
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,042
When I was a kid, you know,
I used to massage my father's legs.

1631
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:40,208
I see.

You were bright from your childhood. Hmm?

1633
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:46,667

everyone used to say,

"This girl will make
the whole village proud."

A little higher.

1636
01:55:56,292 --> 01:55:58,042
May I ask something, hukum?

1637
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,792
Is this palace
more than a hundred years old?

1638
01:56:03,042 --> 01:56:05,333
-Such beautiful flowers drawn on the wall.
-A little more.

May I ask something, hukum?

01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,958
Are Rani Sa
and young Mehersa going abroad?

1643
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:23,083
If they leave from here,
the palace will feel so empty,

1644
01:56:23,167 --> 01:56:25,833
but I hear
it's very beautiful abroad, huh?

Hukum, but--
I'm sorry, hukum.

1648
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:37,625
I'm a fool.
I don't think before speaking.

1649
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:39,042
I'm sorry.

Stop gossiping now.

And pay attention here.

1652
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:49,167
Don't you want to live here?

1653
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:51,833
Huh?

1654
01:56:55,708 --> 01:56:56,792
Do you drink?

Take it. Take it.

01:57:34,417 --> 01:57:36,333
That will spoil your saree, huh?

1663
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,583
[chuckles] It's not a problem,
I'll wash it.

Will you do something?

1665

We will go to England.

and it's all gone.

wants to leave me and go.
