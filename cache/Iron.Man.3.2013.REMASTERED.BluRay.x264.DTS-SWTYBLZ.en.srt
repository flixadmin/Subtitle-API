Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1722
01:29:37,993 --> 01:29:40,872
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1723
01:29:40,953 --> 01:29:42,831
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1724
01:29:42,953 --> 01:29:44,706
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

off the coast.

1734
01:30:02,153 --> 01:30:05,544

Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:36,233 --> 01:30:38,702
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:38,873 --> 01:30:39,909
But we also have to figure out this

- Right.

1750

We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1758
01:30:55,513 --> 01:30:57,903

surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1760
01:31:00,313 --> 01:31:03,624
The president's safe on Air Force One

I think we're good, here.

RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:07,193 --> 01:31:08,912
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

the president somehow.</i>

We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:12,553 --> 01:31:14,590
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:14,673 --> 01:31:17,586
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:04,793 --> 01:32:07,592
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
