Brave man, terrible judgment.

10
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,189
Attacking him was stupid.

[Grunts]

Are you going to say something clever?

15
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,380
Go on, say something clever.

16
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,426
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

17
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,016
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

Ned Stark.

19
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,646
One of our men interfered,

speared him through the leg
before l could finish him.

21

Why is he still alive?

22
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,406
lt wouldn't have been clean.

23
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,949
Clean.

24
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,329
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

25
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
l could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

26
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,626
That's what you want
people to think of you.

27
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,961
lt's the truth.

28
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,882
When you hear them whispering
''kingslayer'' behind your back,

29
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,967
doesn't it bother you?

30
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,305
Of course it bothers me.

31
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,307
A lion doesn't concern himself

32
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,392
with the opinions of the sheep.

33
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,564
l suppose l should be grateful
that your vanity

34
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,733
got in the way
of your recklessness.

35
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,988
l'm giving you half of our forces -

36
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,489
30,OOO men.

37
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,327
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

38
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,829
and remind her that Lannisters

39
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,873
pay their debts.

40
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:12,127
l didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

41
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,671
He's a Lannister.

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,133
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,677
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

44
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,680
the less our name commands respect.

45
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,849
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

46
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,352
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

47
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,357
lf another house
can seize one of our own

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,068
and hold him captive with impunity,

49
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,445
we are no longer a house to be feared.

50
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,035
Your mother's dead.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,287
Before long l'll be dead.

52
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,206
And you...

53
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,500
and your brother
and your sister

54
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,126
and all of her children.

55
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,506
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

56
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,051
lt's the family name that lives on.

57
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,554
lt's all that lives on.

58
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,723
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

59
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,684
but family.

60
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,853
Do you understand?

61
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,858
Hmm.

62
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,743
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

63
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:31,039
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

64
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,875
And you're still blessed with youth.

65
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,462
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

66
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,049
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

67
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,636
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

68
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,645
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

69
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,816
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

70
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,320
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

71
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,035
l need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

72
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,331
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

73
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,999
Now.

74
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,939
[Bell tolling]

75
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,988
You're in pain.

76
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,038
l've had worse, my lady.

77
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,416
Perhaps it's time to go home.

78
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,335
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

79
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,921
l know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,924
Do you, Lord Stark?

81
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,511
ls that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

82
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,056
Has he done this before?

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,563
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

84
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,273
Your brother...

85
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,691
or your lover?

86
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,115
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

87
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,742
to keep bloodlines pure.

88
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,911
Jaime and l are more
than brother and sister.

89
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,163
We shared a womb.

90
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,125
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

91
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,128
My son saw you with him.

92
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,094
Do you love your children?

93
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,096
- With all my heart.
- No more than l love mine.

94
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,349
- And they're all Jaime's.
- [Chuckles] Thank the gods.

95
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,020
ln the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

96
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,938
l finish him off in other ways.

97
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,774
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

98
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,069
Hated him? l worshipped him.

99
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,908
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

100
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,953
And when l finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

101
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,788
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

102
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,082
it was the happiest moment of my life.

103
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,003
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

104
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,964
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

105
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,219
and whispered in my ear, ''Lyanna.''

106
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,640
Your sister was a corpse
and l was a living girl

107
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,767
and he loved her more than me.

108
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,314
When the king returns from his hunt,
l'll tell him the truth.

109
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,651
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

110
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,445
l will not have
their blood on my hands.

111
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,989
Go as far away as you can,

112
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,325
with as many men as you can.

113
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,786
Because wherever you go,

114
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,163
Robert's wrath will follow you.

115
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,999
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

116
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,377
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

117
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,338
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

118
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,258
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

119
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,718
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

120
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,471
Such a sad mistake.

121
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,099
l've made many mistakes in my life...

122
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,768
but that wasn't one of them.

123
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,436
Oh, but it was.

124
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,773
When you play the game of thrones,
you win.. .

125
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,316
or you die.

126
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,319
There is no middle ground.

127
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,454

Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

137
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,450
Oh!

138
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,411
No, no, no, no!

139
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,832
ls that what they teach you
up in the North?

140
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,586
And you -
wherever you're from -

141
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,632
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

142
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,136
Either of you understand
a thing that l'm saying?

143
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,931
Yes, my lord.

144
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,308
Let's start over, shall we?

145
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,853
You be the man...

146
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,939
and you be the woman.

147
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,819
Well, go ahead.

148
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,449
Slowly.

[Soft moaning]

150
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,919
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

151
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,463
They know what you are.

152
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,674
They know it's all just an act.

153
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,552
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

154
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,762
Now, that takes time.

155
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,557
You need to...

156
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,600
ease into it.

157
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,771
Go ahead.

He wants to believe you.

162
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,087
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

163
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,382
He knows he's better
than other men.

00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,927
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

165
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,555
He's so good,

166
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,393
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

167
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,104
overcoming your very nature.

168
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,442
Why don't you join us, my lord?

169
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,070
l'm saving myself for another.

170
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,698
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

171
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,825
- A stupid saying.
- [Moans]

172
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,953
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

173
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,413
[Moans]

174
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,457
She must be very beautiful.

175
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,252
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

176
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,338
l do believe my lord's in love.

177
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,841
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

178
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,176
Play with her arse.

179
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,428
And she loved me too.

180
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,974
l was her little confidant, her plaything.

181
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,061
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

182
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,023
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

183
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,442
the castle that she wanted to live in

184
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,445
and the man that she wanted to marry -

185
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,823
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

186
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,077
- [Moaning]
- So l challenged him to a duel.

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,996
l mean, why not?
l'd read all the stories.

188
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,792
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

189
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,338
ln the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

190
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,882
''He's just a boy,'' she said.

191
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,926
''Please don't hurt him.''

192
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,764
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

193
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,599
ls she still married to him?

194
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,644
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

195
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,646
[Gasping loudly]

196
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,525
..and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

197
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,236
She loves him, l'm afraid.

198
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,906
And why wouldn't she?
l mean, who could compare to him?

199
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,242
- He's just so...

..good.

Do you know what l learned,
Iosing that duel?

204
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,092
l learned that l'll never win, not that way.

205
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,094
That's their game,

206
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,763
their rules.

207
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,849
l'm not going to fight them.

00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,144
l'm going to fuck them.
That's what l know.

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,396
That's what l am.

210
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,357
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

211
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,777
And what do you want?

00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,447
Oh, everything, my dear.

Everything there is.

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,414
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

215
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,464
Hmm.

[Footsteps]

217
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,948
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

218
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,746
Where l come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

219
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,542
Where l come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

220
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,920
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

221
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,923
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

222
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,551
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

223
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:29,263
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

224
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,392
Where is it you come from?

225
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,602
The Iron Islands.

226
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,770
They far away?

227
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

Trust me, you've never heard
where l'm from neither.

''Trust me, my lord.''

You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

by their proper titles.

- Lord.

Why?

What do you mean, why?

237
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,052
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

238
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,762
What's that got to do with you?

239
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,724
lf your father's lord,

240
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,726
how can you be lord too?

241
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,314
- l will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,274
No, you...

243
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,154
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

244
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,073
l just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

245
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,452
- l'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

246
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,622
That makes you a southerner to me.

247
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,585
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

248
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,463
Couldn't say, my lord.

249

Don't know what ''impunent'' means.

lmpudent.

251
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,970
lt means rude, disrespectful.

Do you want to lose that chain?

253
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,648

The lady is our guest.

00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,194
l thought she was our prisoner.

256
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,948
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

257
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,378
Chances are l won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

chew that boy up

and pick their teeth with his bones.

Why did you come here?

00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,437
Didn't mean to come here.

265
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,440
Meant to get much further south than this.

266

As far south as south goes,

00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:03,400
..poachers, rapers,

476
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,569
killers, thieves.

477
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:09,323
You came alone, in chains,

478
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,116
without friends

479
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,368
or honour.

480
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,914
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

481
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,416
- [Thunder]
- Some of you bear the names

482
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,418
of proud Houses,

483
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:25,214
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

484
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,090
lt does not matter.

485
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:30,219
All that is in the past.

486
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,262
Here...

487
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,349
on the Wall...

488
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,851
we are all one House.

489
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,272
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

490
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,151
You're going to be a ranger.

491
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,403
lsn't that what you always wanted?

492
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,906
l want to find my uncle.

493
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,244
l know he's alive out there.
l know he is.

494
00:33:56,578 --> 00:34:00,290
l wish l could help you,
but l'm no ranger.

495
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,376
lt's the steward's life for me.

496
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,504
There's honour in being a steward.

497
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,006
Not much, really.

498
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,591
But there's food.

499
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,474
Here...you begin anew.

500
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,484
A man of the Night's Watch...

501
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,989
lives his life for the realm.

502
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,409
Not for a king...

503
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,328
or a lord, or the honour of this House

504
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,789
or that House,

505
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,667
not for gold or glory,

506
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,128
or a woman's love,

507
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,213
but for the realm

508
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:51,008
and all the people in it.

509
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,595
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

510
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,681
Think carefully before you say them.

511
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,601
The penalty for desertion...

512
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,061
is death.

513
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,861
You can take your vows here...

514
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,696
tonight...

515
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,114
at sunset.

516
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,451
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

517
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,580
l do, my lord.

518
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,083
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

519
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,251
Yes, my lord.

520
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,254
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

521
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:32,174
And your old gods too, maybe.

522
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,261
My lord, might l go as well?

523
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,222
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

524
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,641
No, my lord.

525
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,310
l was named in the light of the Seven,

526
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,938
as my father was
and his father before him.

527
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,942
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

528
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,196
The Night's Watch is my House now.

529
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,823
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

530
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,244
Perhaps the old gods will.

531
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,080
As you wish, lad.

532
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,042
You've all been assigned an order,

533
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,962
according to our needs

534
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,755
and your strengths.

535
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,716
Halder to the builders.

536
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,469
Pyp to the stewards.

537
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,430
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

538
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,474
Samwell to the stewards.

539
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:26,144
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

540
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,230
Balian to the rangers.

541
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:29,857
Rast to the rangers.

542
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,567
Jon to the stewards.

543
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,402
Rancer to the builder.

544
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,405
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

545
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,867
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

546
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,995
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

547
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,331
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

548
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,750
Nelugo to the rangers.

549
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,379
May all the gods preserve you.

550
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,678
Rangers with me.

551
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,306
Builders!

552
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:25,871
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

553
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,917
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

554
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:34,713
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

555
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,675
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

556
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,595
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

557
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,848
Make no comment about his nose.

558
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,102
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

559
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,189
has requested you
for his personal steward.

560
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,902
Will l serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

561
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:00,781
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

562
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,700
change his sheets
and blankets daily

563
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,496
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

564
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,042
Do you take me for a servant?

565
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,753
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

566
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:17,673
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

567
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,343
- May l go?
- As you wish.

568
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,103
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

569
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,105
l see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

570
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,982
He wanted it and he got it.

571
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,568
Stewards are nothing but maids!

572
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,695
l'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

573
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:42,823
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

574
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,909
l was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

575
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,954
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

576
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,875
l pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

577
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,793
So now l'm here -
at the end of the world

578
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,671
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

579
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,673
l'll never see my family again.

580
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,884
l'll never be inside a woman again.

581
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,135
So don't tell me about fair.

582
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:07,055
l thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

583
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:11,268
Think l was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

584
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,399
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
l'd like to hear a song.

585
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,198
Now listen to me.

586
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:27,576
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

587
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,494
You'll be with him day and night.

588
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:32,080
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

589
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:36,001
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

590
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,003
squire for him in battle.

591
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,715
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

592
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,425
And he asked for you himself.

593
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,262
He wants to groom you for command.

594
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,019
l just...

595
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,064
l always wanted to be a ranger.

596
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,318
l always wanted to be a wizard.

597
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,697
- [Laughs]
- What?

598
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,033
No, l'm serious.

599
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,702
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

600
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,546
Lord Stark...a moment.

601
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,757
Alone, if you will.

602
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,394
He named you Protector of the Realm.

603
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,647
He did.

604
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,399
She won't care.

605
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,944
Give me an hour and l can put
a hundred swords at your command.

606
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,821
And what should l do
with a hundred swords?

607
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,783
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

608
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:53,328
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

609
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,249
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

610
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,420
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

611
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,423
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

612
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,300
What about Stannis?

613
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,636
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

614
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,431
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

615
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,183
Stannis is your older brother.

616
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,435
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

617
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:20,647
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

618
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,735
What's best for the Kingdoms?

619
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,738
What's best for the people we rule?

620
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,408
We all know what Stannis is.

621
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,786
He inspires no love or loyalty.

622
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,580
He's not a king.

623
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,291
l am.

624
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,883
Stannis is a commander.

625
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,136
He's led men into war twice.

626
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,971
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

627
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,891
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

628
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,310
Tell me something.

629
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,812
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

630
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,281
l will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

631
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,825
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

632
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,133
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

633
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,886
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

634
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,348
Not his steward...

635
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,768
not his captain of the guard...

636
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,145
and not his wife.

637
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,861
Only Stannis himself.

638
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,864
- [Knocking]
- Yes, my lord.

639
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,576
Now leave us.

640
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,379
My Lord Protector.

641
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,970
The king has no trueborn sons.

642
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,556
Joffrey and Tommen...

643
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,600
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

644
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:25,105
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

645
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,025
Lord Stannis.

646
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,360
So it would seem.

647
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,448
- Unless...
- There is no ''unless''.

648
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,867
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

649
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,077
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

650
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:43,207
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

651
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,879
Do you have a shred of honour?

652
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:52,799
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

653
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,093
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

654
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,721
reach out and take it.

655
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,932
Make peace with the Lannisters.

656
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:03,477
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

657
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,313
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

658
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,858
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

659
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,236
we simply reveal his little secret

660
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,447
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

661
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:19,368
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
l assure you.

662
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,537
My price would be modest.

663
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,665
What you suggest is treason.

664
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,875
Only if we lose.

665
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,214
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say.. .

666
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,801
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

667
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:39,388
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

668
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,723
That's why it's called ''making peace''.

669
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,060
No. l won't do it.

670
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,688
So it will be Stannis and war?

671
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,982
There is no other choice.

672
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,442
He is the heir.

673
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,028
So why did you call me here?

674
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,239
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

675
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,951
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

676
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,871
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

677
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,833
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

678
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,751
l need the gold cloaks.

679
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,046
The City Watch is 2,OOO strong...

680
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,300
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

681
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,762
Look at you.

682
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,932
You know what you want me to do,

683
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,059
you know it has to be done,

684
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,270
but it's not honourable, so...

685
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,772
the words stick in your throat.

686
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,901
When the queen proclaims one king

687
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,736
and the Hand proclaims another,

688
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,530
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

689
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,117
Who do they follow?

690
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,041
The man who pays them.

[Jon and Samwell] Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:45,639

l am the shield that guards

707
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,833
l pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

708

for this night
and all the nights to come.

709
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:19,047
You knelt as boys.

710
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,633
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

711
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:36,773
Well done. Well done.

712
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,532
What's he got there?

713
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:48,660
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

714
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:53,165
Gods be good!

715
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,757
What will they do to him?

716
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,221
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

717
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,891
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

718
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,851
And when he falls?

719
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,022
l saw a man last nine miles once.

720
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,901
King Robert still wants me dead.

721
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,278
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

722
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:27,241
l thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

723
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,993
He will never leave you alone.

724
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,413
lf you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

lf you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

He will never abandon the hunt.

728
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,466
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

729
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,635
Your son will have Targaryen blood

with 40,OOO riders behind him.

731

He will not have my son.

00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,494

790
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,750
Ser Barristan...

791
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:13,378
l believe no man here
could ever question your honour.

792
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:28,143
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

793
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:39,071
''Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

794

''until the heir come of age.''

797
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,207
May l see that letter, Ser Barristan?

798
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:00,342
Protector of the Realm.

799
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:07,474
ls this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

800
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,143
A piece of paper?

801
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:16,358
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

802
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,322
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

803
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,701
Allow me to return the courtesy.

804
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,995
Bend the knee, my lord.

805
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:31,039
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

and we shall allow you
to live out your days

807
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,087
in the grey waste you call home.

808
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,423
Your son has no claim to the throne.

809
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:40,757
- [Snorts]
- Liar!

810
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,760
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

811
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,721
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

812
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:50,475
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

813
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:54,479
You think he stands alone?

814
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:00,861
Kill him! Kill all of them!

Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.

816
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:09,286
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

817
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:11,205
Men of the Watch!

818
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,711
l want no bloodshed.

819
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,339
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

820
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,424
No one needs to die.

821
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,261
[Commander] Now!

822
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:39,441
