00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,333
Be pissed, but it's
for your own good.

166
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,502
Oh, and, uh...

167
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,104
I'm sorry about Parks.

168
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,973
She deserved better.

169
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,375
BULLOCK:
Yo, Jim!

170
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,511
Message from Father Mike.

171
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,379
That symbol
is from something

172
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,882
called the Order of St. Dumas.

173
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,750
They used to have
an abbey downtown.

174
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,086
Barnes just told me
to lay off of Galavan.

175
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,021
Oh. Well, then
you probably don't care

176
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,324
that the mayor's office tried
to buy the abbey<i> last week.</i>

177
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,360
Galavan tried to buy it?
Yeah.

178
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,394
Some urban development nonsense.

179
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,762
New owners said no.

180
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,298
It's a Chinese
slap-slap joint now.

181
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,271
Hell with it.
You got the address?

182
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,339
Yep. Let's go get lucky.

183
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,977
(knocking)

184
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,979
♪ ♪

185
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,341
♪ ♪

186
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,351
Your uncle made me an offer:
the name of my parents' killer

187
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,653
in exchange for selling him
my shares in Wayne Enterprises.

188
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,988
I said no.

189
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,990
But circumstances
have changed.

190
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,593
You're going to sell?

191
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,127
No.

192
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,896
Then...
Your uncle
was arrested,

193
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,364
and his assets are frozen.

194
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,566
Tell him I'll pay for
his defense; in exchange,

195
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,668
he gives me the name.

196
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,737
You're taking
advantage of him.
I have something

197
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,772
he needs, he has something
I need, that's all.

198
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,775
Do you believe what people
are saying about him?

199
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,578
I don't care what people say.

200
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,647
My father was investigating
Wayne Enterprises,

201
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,283
then he and my mother
were killed.

202
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,018
Last year, I investigated
Wayne Enterprises,

203
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,620
and someone tried
to kill Alfred.

204
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,688
Either I find out
who killed my parents

205
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,259
and stop whatever's happening
in my company, or I'm dead.

206
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,395
I need that name.

207
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,264
The grand jury
hearing is today.

208
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,899
He's going to
be cleared.

209
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,900
What if he's not?

210
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,234
What then?

211
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,304
Silver, get him
to tell you the name,

212
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,672
and I will make
sure he has

213
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,407
the best defense money
can buy, I promise.

214
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,576
You think he's guilty.

215
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,912
Why would you believe
anything he says?

216
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,681
Because it would come from you.

217
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,120
If you bring me the name,
I'll know it's real.

218
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,558
(whispering)

219
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,703
Do you mean that?

220
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,448
I'll call you
after I talk to him.

221
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,589
(bell tolling in distance)

222
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,893
Still got to get the name.

223
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,529
I will. I'm late for school.

224
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,543
(crow cawing in distance)

225
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,713
Not yet.

226
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,194
You sure about this?

227
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,629
Doesn't look much like
a massage parlor.

228
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,865
Maybe there's
another entrance.

229
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,434
(women screaming)

230
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,744
GORDON:
Get these girls out of here.

231
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,546
Come on, come on. Come on.

232
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,985
GCPD!

233
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,820
(weak groaning)
Sir?

234
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,725
(sighs)

235
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,228
(grunting)

236
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,672
(bones crack)

237
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,841
(grunts)

238
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,578
(panting)

239
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,520
Stop!

240
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,525
Drop the knife.

241
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,895
The day of reckoning
is at hand,

242
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,296
and the blood of nine

243
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,998
shall wash away the sin.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,132
Uh-huh.

245
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,467
Who are you?

246
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,102
What's your connection
to Galavan?

247
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,371
And Gotham shall be cleansed.

248
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:55,840
Hey.

249
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,908
(truck horn blaring)
Hey!

250
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,549
GORDON:
<i>The girls at the parlor</i>

251
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,652
say they saw
at least six monks.

252
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,120
Uh-huh.

253
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,423
They have to be a part
of this same order of St. Dumas.

254
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,492
Bullock's contact says
they're penitents.

255
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,728
Yeah, I forgot my
dictionary in my purse.

256
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,032
They believed in
purification through pain.

257
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,767
Blood.

258
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,236
They were big
in the old days in Gotham.

259
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,839
Then about a hundred years ago,
vanished.

260
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,608
It was their crest we found
in Galavan's penthouse.

261
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,877
And now they're back
and they're pissed off

262
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,847
that their home is
a high-end rub-and-tug joint.

263
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,315
Fine.

264
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,318
Gather what you have
and give it to Alvarez.

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,552
Captain, these monks
could be the key

266
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,987
to whatever Galavan is planning.

267
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,990
As I recall, Detective,
I already gave you a case.

268
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,225
And I expressly
told you

269
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,260
to move away from Galavan.

270
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,628
The dead guy at the ports--

271
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,197
he attacked a woman
across town yesterday.

272
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,000
In her statement, she said
her attacker was pulled off

273
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,702
by a man dressed like a monk.

274
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,005
Does the universe normally
like you this much, Detective?

275
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,373
First time.

276
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,008
All right, say they're
the same monks.

277
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,109
Why would they kill

278
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,078
a bunch of bankers and some...

279
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,613
nobody street thug?

280
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,881
The monk said,

281
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,417
"The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin."

282
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,719
It's obviously
some sort of ritual.

283
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,554
And if Galavan
is connected,

284
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,589
what does he stand to gain?
I don't know.

285
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,859
We have to find a monk
and get him to talk.

286
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,394
Well, considering
what this last one did,

287
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,062
that might not be so easy.

288
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,464
Captain, it's no coincidence

289
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,232
that this is happening
just as Galavan's

290
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,300
about to stand trial.

291
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,036
Whatever it is,
it's going down today.

292
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,404
"The blood of the nine."

293
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,072
Five are
already dead.

294
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,241
Okay.

295
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,643
But I still want you

296
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,078
at the grand jury to
hear James' testimony.

297
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,914
And, Gordon,
whatever this is,

298
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,549
stop it.

299
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,320
(school bell rings,
phone line beeps)

300
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,222
SILVER (recorded):
Bruce, it's Silver.

301
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,924
I just saw my uncle.

302
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,926
He agreed to your deal.

303
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,527
Everything you asked.

304
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,330
He... he told me
the name, Bruce.

305
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,432
Meet me across the way
after school.

306
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,334
(line beeps)

307
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,113
(tires screech)

308
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,416
(muffled sobbing)

309
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,084
MAN:
Shh.

310
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,253
Don't scream. Don't run.

311
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,056
Just get in.

312
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,357
Or we kill the girl.

313
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,359
(muffled shout)

314
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,601
MAN:
Go.

315
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,374
The scar tissue's old.

316
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,875
See how the wounds wrap
over his shoulder?

317
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,043
It was definitely
self-inflicted.

318
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,778
I stabbed him,
he didn't flinch.

319
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,348
And there are thick scars
on the palms.

320
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,016
He cut himself there repeatedly.

321
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,918
Father Mike said
the leaders cut themselves

322
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,054
and then mark the followers
with the blood, like a blessing.

323
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,689
Charming.

324
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,758
Dug up two more bodies
from the past three days.

325
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,193
Career hoods.

326
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,029
Killed somewhere, then dumped--
both their throats cut.

327
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,230
GORDON:
Seven down,

328
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,798
two to go.

329
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
It's weird.

330
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,002
How has nobody seen
these monks till now?

331
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,071
A, they're killing people
and carrying them across town,

332
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,440
and B, they're monks.

333
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,644
The woman who was attacked
yesterday,

334
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,346
she said the monk vanished

335
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,015
with the
attacker, but...

336
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,850
that alley was a dead end.

337
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,658
The sewers.

338
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,760
Oh, no.

339
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,498
(rats squeaking)

340
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,671
So, the monk
drags the woman's attacker

341
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,439
into the alley
above us.

342
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,542
Next thing,
he's food for seagulls.

343
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,813
Ports are this way.

344
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,888
Again?

345
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,158
Did you try
jiggling the handle?

346
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,028
Well, what did
you put down it?

347
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,965
Dr. Thompkins,
can I help you?

348
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,234
Hi, Ed. This is the
autopsy on the dead monk.

349
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,370
Jim wants you
to run toxicology.

350
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,172
Fascinating.

351
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,008
The need to inflict that
kind of pain on oneself.

352
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,876
Is there anything else?

353
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,578
No.

354
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,647
Yes.

355
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,116
Was that Kristen
you were just talking to?

356
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,019
What?
Oh, sorry. It sounded
like you were talking

357
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,554
to somebody in your apartment,
and who besides...

358
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,255
I was talking to my plumber.

359
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,990
Oh.

360
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,992
Well, have you heard
from Kristen?

361
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,395
I know she said she was sick.
I was thinking of stopping by...

362
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,097
As it happens,
she's not sick.

363
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,665
She lied.

364
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,966
To all of us.

365
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,001
I just found out,
Miss Kringle left town

366
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,404
with Officer Dougherty.

367
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,005
She left Gotham
with Dougherty?

368
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,307
Mm-hmm.

369
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,375
But he was abusive.

370
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,442
(chuckles softly)

371
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,077
Love.

372
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,878
Wow.

373
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
I-I'm... I'm stunned.

374
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,648

376

377
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,858
No. I don't think so.

Oh, Ed...

381
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,867
you must be devastated.

382
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,236
Right now, I'm just trying
to focus on the job.

383
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,772
Well, let me know
if you ever want to talk.

384
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,007
Thank you. That means a lot.

385

OSWALD:
Where is the spicy mustard?

389
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,223
You better not have finished...

390
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,259
Ah. Never mind.

391
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,827
(line clicks)

392
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,098

(quiet sobbing)

394
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,069
Silver, are you okay?
What happened?

395
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,272
(door creaking)

396
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,241
(man sighs loudly)

397
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,078
You have one chance.

398
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,079
You let us go...

399
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,348
(sobbing)

400
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,417
You talk...

401
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,319
when I tell you to.

402
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,488
Understand?

403
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,557
Now...

404
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,193
so you know,
we are outside of the city,

405
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,362
and there is absolutely no one
to hear you scream,

406
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,730
except me.

407
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,600
You work for the people
inside Wayne Enterprises.

408
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,835
Whoever's paying you...
(grunts)

409
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,839
Again...

410
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,809
you talk when
I tell you to.

411
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,745
Now, my employers have heard

412
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:46,217
that you are thinking of
selling your company shares

413
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,586
to the uncle of this one?

414
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,222
That's not good.

415
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,157
But not why we're here.

416
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,860
The issue is:
someone's been nosing

417
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,128
into the deaths...

418
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,197
of Thomas...

419
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,832
and poor Martha Wayne.

420
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,335
And I wonder who.

421
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,437
Mmm.

422
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,405
Kidding.

423
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,176
We know it was blondie's uncle.

424
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,577
So...

425
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,413
I've been tasked to find out
what dear old

426
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,350
uncle told little Bruce Wayne.

427
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,484
Nothing.

428
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,020
Galavan didn't
tell me anything.

429
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,155
You think

430
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,592
that I won't hurt you
because you're a kid?

431
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,828
Or because you're you?

432
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,133
How'd that work out for
your mummy and daddy?

433
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:40,771
There are<i> billions</i>
at stake here.

434
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,274
And that's with a B.

435
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,643
Do what you want to me.

436
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,678
I don't know anything.
Okay,

437
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,979
so we start with Goldilocks.

438
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,314
You touch her, and I swear...

439
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,383
Yeah?

440
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:56,720
I've been threatened by
the best, kid, and you...

441
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,291
not exactly terrifying.

442
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,326
Now, let me tell you

443
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,395
how this is going to go.

444
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,396
(blade clinks)

445
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,031
In a minute,

446
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:10,634
I'm gonna take one of you

447
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,570
into the back

448
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,672
and start cutting off

449
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,707
your fingers.
(sobs softly)

450
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,776
And you're gonna talk.

451
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,945
I've been doing this
a very, very long time,

452
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,081
and everyone talks.

453
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,449
(sobs)

454
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,920
So... unless you're
really into wearing mittens,

455
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,556
this is your last chance.

456
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,794
What does Theo Galavan know?

457
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,101
Okey-dokey.

458
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,972
Let's go.

459
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,507
No, no, no, no, no!
BRUCE: No, wait, stop!

460
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,742
Stop, stop, stop!
No!

461
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,143
Silver, you have
to tell him.

462
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,379
I'll hold my side of the
deal, I promise. Please.

463
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,347
Please. I promise.

464
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,517
But my uncle
didn't tell me anything.

465
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,919
But you left me a message.

466
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,388
I was supposed to keep you busy
till this evening.

467
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,324
He's sure
he's going to be freed.

468
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,493
Then he'll convince you
to sell your company.

469
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,095
(gasps)
I'm sorry, Bruce.

470
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,397
I don't know anything.

471
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,765
Really?

472
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,733
I don't!

473
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,167
That's a pity.

474
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:17,768
No.

475
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,303
No!
Kid.

476
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,437
No! Please.
Kid.

477
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,973
You really need
better taste in women.

478
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:24,642
No!

479
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,710
(screaming)

480
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,113
(screaming) Stop! Bruce!
No!

481
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,920
(water dripping)

482
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,190
BULLOCK: Just when you think
Gotham's shown her last jewel,

483
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,393
she reveals herself
like a flower.

484
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,694
You're mixing
metaphors.

485
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,196
I'm in a freakin' sewer.

486
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,898
(indistinct, distant shouting)

487
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,634
You hear something?

488
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,069
A voice.

489
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,904
(man screams in distance)

490
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,057
I know this bum.

491
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,992
Muscle for hire.

492
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,327
Check out the finger painting
on the forehead.

493
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,363
Victim at the port
had the same thing.

494
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,831
Like a blessing.

495
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,033
Whoever did this
can't be too far away.

496
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,435
We should...

497
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,003
Harvey!
(grunting)

498
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:34,812
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

499
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,047
Please, please, don't. Hold.

500
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,824
He needs an ambulance.

501
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:50,527
Boo-hoo. We got to wake
him up, make him talk.

502
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,363
Religious fanatic who doesn't
feel pain? What's our angle?

503
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,467
These nut-jobs have killed eight
people. Whatever their plan is,

504
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,435
whatever Galavan's up to,
it is happening now.

505
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,104
We make him talk.

506
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,905
What are we gonna do,
torture him?

507
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,841
Threaten to let him die?
He wouldn't care.

508
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,478
There's no signal
down here.

509
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,113
I'll call in, but
I got to go up.

510
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,114
Thank you.

511
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,583
God!

512
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:13,917
(weakly):
The day...

513
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,121
...of reckoning.

514
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:23,093
The day... of
reckoning, brother.

515
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,971
Bruce?

516
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,405
(door opens)

517
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,674
(man whoops)

518
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,145
Well, if nothing else,

519
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:46,617
today has given me a newfound
respect for boy billionaires.

520
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,951
Kid's tougher
than he looks.

521
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,653
Didn't know
a damn thing.

522
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,555
Did you kill him?

523
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,924
No, not yet.

524
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,460
But the rest is
kind of up to you.

525
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,662
I told you...

526
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,864
my uncle didn't
tell me anything.

527
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,966
Are you gonna stick
to that story?

528
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,135
It's the truth.

529
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,137
Bruce, I'm sorry!
I don't know anything!

530
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,473
You know what?

531
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,074
I don't like you.

532
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,343
The Wayne kid--

533
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,913
he's got some sap in him.

534
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,781
But you...

535
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:21,652
You know when you meet someone,
and you just don't click?

536
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,221
That's the way

537
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,823
I feel about you.

538
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,792
That's why this is
gonna be so much easier.

539
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,063
What are you doing?

540
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm gonna make sure
that you are telling the truth.

541
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,739
Touch me, and my uncle
will have you gutted.

542
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,409
Every person you love
will die screaming.

543
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,377
I've had enough of this.

544
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,848
Let me go. Now!

545
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,349
Well, hello!

546
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,452
Nice to meet ya!

547
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,155
I knew there was
someone hiding in there.

548
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,624
Are you deaf as well as ugly?

549
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,227
I said... let me go!

550
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,663
I heard you, princess.

551
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,699
What are you doing?
(knife slices)

552
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:10,868
Stop!

553
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,537
Malone! It's Malone!

554
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,640
What's that?
Malone. That's the name.

555
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:20,244
The man who killed
Bruce Wayne's parents.

556
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,612
So your uncle did tell you.

557
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,180
Not today. Before.

558
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,481
When he first found out.

559
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,682
Malone's a very common name.

560
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,451
His first name begins with "M."

561
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,319
That's all I know.

562
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,787
Mm...

563
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,022
Stop!

564
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,924
You know what?

565
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,926
I believe you.

566
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,663
(shouting):
Are we good?

567
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,001
Yes.

568
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,171
We're good.

569
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,873
Hey.

570
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,009
Remember me?

571
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,710
The gutter trash?

572
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,247
Bruce... what's happening?

573
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,082
What does it look like, dummy?

574
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,584
We tricked you.

575
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,052
Though, if it
was up to me,

576
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,254
you would've lost
a few fingers.

577
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,924
Going soft, Tom?

578
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,825
Cat.

579
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,396
BRUCE:
Thank you.

580
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,498
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.

581
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,333
Pleasure doing business.

582
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,734
Sorry about the slaps.

583
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,569
Now are you two
gonna be okay

584
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,772
with this one,
or would you like me to, uh...?

585
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,473
(knife scrapes)
SELINA: Nah.

586
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,008
We're cool.

587
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,411
Mr. Wayne. Boys.

588
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,279
(whistles)

589
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,483
You're probably
very confused right now.

590
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,319
Probably have
a million questions

591
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,054
going through
your head.
Bruce, please...

592
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,555
Be quiet!

593
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,090
I trusted you, Silver.

594
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,492
Even after
your uncle was arrested,

595
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,061
I still believed
you were my friend.

596
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:47,497
It was finally Selina
who convinced me otherwise.

597
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,099
I never bought your stupid act.

598
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,001
BRUCE: She broke
into your apartment,

599
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,070
found the file
you had on me.

600
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,072
It was clear that
you'd been sent

601
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,707
to push me to
sell my company,

602
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,675
that your entire family
was corrupt, but I still

603
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,511
had to find out what your uncle
knew about my parents' murder.

604
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,047
Now I do.

605
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,682
Thank you.

606
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,251
Bruce! Wait.

607
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,821
That name wasn't real.

608
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,123
It was just something
I made up to stop him.

609
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,258
SELINA:
That's funny.

610
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,427
You only made it up

611
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,262
when<i> you</i> were
under the knife,

612
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,898
not when Bruce was
getting tortured.

613
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,533
(chuckles)
You little bitch, I'll...

614
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,302
Please.

615
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,104
Try it.

616
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,543
You're right
about my uncle.

617
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,679
He's everything everyone says.

618
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,615
Worse.

619
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,151
When he finds out
what I told you,

620
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,320
he'll kill me.

621
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,923
You pretended to be my friend.

622
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,627
Good-bye, Silver.

623
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,096
Bruce.

624
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,298
The things you told me today.

625
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,469
I believed you.

626
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,938
Yes. That was the point.

627
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,306
SILVER:
Bruce, you can't

628
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,842
do this.

629
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,045
It isn't you.

630
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,388
That's what you think.

631
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,660
But you're wrong.

632
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,166
Bruce...
(door opens)

633
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,400
Bruce!

634
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,235
Bruce!

635
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,946
(water dripping)

636
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,118
The ambulance is...

637
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,924
Drink...

638
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,225
brother.

639
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,593
(monk coughs)

640
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,995
Can't... see.

641
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,230
You're hurt.

642
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,231
Lie still.

643
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,499
The police?

644
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,601
Dead. We got here
just in time.

645
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,538
The blood of the nine...

646
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,074
BOTH:
Shall wash away the sin.

647
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,442
MONK:
I fulfilled

648
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,177
my task, brother.

649
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,279
All that remains

650
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,314
is the son.

651
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,749
Yes. The son.

652
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,184
MONK:
Give me your blessing,

653
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,953
brother.

654
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,291
Please.

655
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,141
(sighs)

656
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:47,110
The Son of Gotham

657
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,478
shall die,

658
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,614
and the city

659
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,649
shall be cleansed.

660
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,819
WOMAN:
Detective, where is the...?

661
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,388
What?

662
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,657
(blindfold rips)

663
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,559
(panting rapidly)
Who are you?!

664
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,261
GCPD. You're under arrest.

665
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,230
Take him to the hospital, see if
you can get anything from him.

666
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,633
I got to see Barnes.

667
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,810
ALFRED:
Bruce?

668
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,180
Bruce, you in here?

669
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,148
Master Bruce?

670
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,651
Master B, you here?

671
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,124
You're trespassing.

672
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,627
I'm looking
for Bruce Wayne.

673
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,062
Now, he's not answering
his phone.

674
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,931
He's not home,
he's not at school.

675
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,334
My guess, he's with that snotty
little niece of yours.

676
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,869
Sorry.

677
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,737
Now, I suggest
you leave

678
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,706
while you still can.

679
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,609
I see you're a bit
of a player, are you?

680
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,145
As it were then,
Tabby.

681
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,614
Big bad Galavan barks the
orders, and you scamper around,

682
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,883
bringing home dead rabbits,
so you might get

683
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,419
a little pat on the head?
I wonder what he'd do

684
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,221
if I just disappeared you.

685
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,423
Honestly,
I don't think he'd care.

686
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,826
If I learn anything has happened
to that little boy,

687
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,229
we'll find out, won't we?

688
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,770
(both grunting)

689
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,378
(shouts)

690
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,116
Stop it!

691
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,400
(panting)

692
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,104
For the record,
I was telling the truth.

693
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,273
I have no idea
where Bruce Wayne is.

694
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,409
But I'll tell him
you were asking.

695
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,955
(elevator bell dings)

696
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,660
(elevator bell dings)

697
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,329
(thumping)

698
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,468
(groaning softly)

699
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,008
(grunts)

700
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,045
(engine revving)

701
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,815
(gavel banging)

702
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,483
WOMAN:
<i>Mr. Dent,</i>

703
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,785
your witness.

704
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,486
So, Mayor James...

705
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,822
Excuse me,
Mr. Dent.

706
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,223
I think you mean
<i>former</i> mayor.

707
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,026
I'm just a citizen of Gotham...

708
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,928
here to tell the truth.

709
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,199
Mr. James...

710
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,803
...if you could begin
by telling us

711
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,871
where you spent the month
of October this year.

712
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,206
(quietly):
Where the hell have you been?

713
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,874
Bullock and I captured
one of the monks.

714
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,176
I was right.

715
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,510
They're completing
some sort of ritual

716
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,678
to cleanse the city of sin.

717
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,081
They have one
victim left.

718
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,783
They're calling him
the Son of Gotham.

719
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,286
Did they say anything
about Galavan?

720
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,955
JAMES: I was not
kidnapped by Theo Galavan.
They didn't, did they?

721
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,524
(gallery gasping, murmuring)

722
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,793
Quiet!

723
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,462
Mr. James,

724
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,896
please repeat what you said.

725
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,334
Theo Galavan did not kidnap me.

726
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,803
(gallery murmuring)
Your Honor, the witness
has suffered...

727
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,805
Please explain yourself, sir.

728
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,041
Why did you lie?

729
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,009
Who held you captive?

730
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,045
Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin.

731
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,680
He hates Theo Galavan.

732
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:47,083
He tried to kill
him multiple times.

733
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,320
He told me what to say.

734
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,322
He threatened me with
terrible things.

735
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,957
He's lying!
BARNES: Gordon! Gordon!

736
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,925
JUDGE:
Detective Gordon, silence!

737
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,993
Gordon!
MAN:
Your Honor,

738
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,596
I move my client
be released at once.

739
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,531
Your Honor, the State
requests a recess to further...

740
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,500
Quiet. Mr. James,

741
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,435
you do realize you are

742
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,803
under oath?

743
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,806
Oswald Cobblepot...

744
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,075
tortured me,
put my head in a box.

745
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,045
He made me lie.

746
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,416
I'm so very, very sorry.

747
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,483
JUDGE:
In light of

748
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,186
Mr. James' testimony
and the complete

749
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,655
absence of any other
evidence provided

750
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,724
by the State,
I hereby order

751
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,225
Theo Galavan released

752
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,528
and the case
against him dismissed.

753
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,362
Your Honor!
No, Jim.

754
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,998
There's nothing
we can do.

755
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,700
Your Honor,
may I say a few words?

756
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,036
I think that's only fair.

757
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,673
I'd just like to state that...

758
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,809
I harbor no ill will toward

759
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,512
Detective Gordon
and the GCPD.

760
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,880
They did their jobs.

761
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,049
They're still my heroes.

762
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,885
What do you say,
Detective Gordon?

763
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,922
Can we move forward
together to fix

764
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,990
this broken,

765
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,993
beautiful city?

766
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,663
(clamoring)

767
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,832
You son of a bitch!
You're a son of a bitch!

768
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,567
I'm gonna get you!

769
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,368
I'm gonna get you!

770
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,237
JUDGE:
Get him out of here!

771
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,473
Ah, come on,
get your hands off of me!

772
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,008
Relax. We're not
arresting you.

773
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,444
(Taser crackles, Gordon groans)

774
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,687
(door creaks)

775
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,455
Alfred?

776
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,762
He's probably out
looking for me.

777
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,297
Thank you, Selina.

778
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,266
I couldn't have done
this without you.

779
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,369
I was just glad to see
the two-faced bitch get served.

780
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,973
What are you gonna do now?

781
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:54,711
You gonna tell the cops or look
for this Malone guy yourself?

782
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,614
Honestly, I haven't thought
that far ahead.

783
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,219
So, when you whispered to her

784
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,687
b-before

785
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,691
she went to her uncle,
what did you say?

786
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,260
You want to know what I said.

787
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,996
Hey, if you don't want
to tell me, then I can leave.

788
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,864
I told her
I've never met

789
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,200
anyone like her.

790
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,069
I told her
I trusted her with my life.

791
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,405
And that...

792
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,341
I felt tied to her
in a way that I...

793
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:29,412
couldn't explain,
but wouldn't change.

794
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,580
Ever.

795
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,352
The best liars
always tell the truth.

796
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,922
That was true?

797
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,223
Yes.

798
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,561
Just not about her.

799
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,699
(chuckles softly)
Um...

800
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,601
I'm...

801
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,071
I'm gonna steal
one of your cars to...

802
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,040
take to the city. Cool?

803
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,642
Sure.

804
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,253
It's good you're changing.

805
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,722
Just...

806
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,657
don't change too much.

807
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,396
(window opens, closes)

808
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,469
Why did you keep her glasses
to begin with?

809
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,037
I told y...

810
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,572
I loved Miss Kringle.

811
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,975
Just get rid of them.

812
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,043
Dr. Thompkins is suspicious.

813
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,411
(phone beeps)

814
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,779
Amateurs.

815
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,027
(pounding on door)

816
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,231
Gabe, when I gave you
this address,

817
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,700
I was not inviting pop-ins.

818
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,535
Galavan's been let go.

819
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,239
(glasses crackling)

820
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,275
Where is he?

821
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,580
(ship horn blows in distance)

822
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,382
(groans)

823
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,650
THEO:
My, my.

824
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,552
What a difference
a day brings.

825
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,590
Here, you're the
prisoner and I'm free.

826
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,759
Fortune's wheel.

827
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,061
Turn, turn.

828
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,896
These cops?

829
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,899
Good men who can tell which
way the wind's blowing.

830
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,168
Now, we have

831
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,870
a very small window.

832
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,607
I have places to be,
you have to die, but I know

833
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,676
you must have
questions, so...

834
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,044
The monks.

835
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,846
They... work for you?

836
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,315
For centuries,

837
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,318
the Order of St. Dumas
has protected my family.

838
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,524
They have been a light
in a dark world.

839
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,795
Shall I tell you a secret?

840
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,164
Theo Galavan

841
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,300
is a mask.

842
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,369
My name is Dumas,

843
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:09,138
and my family built this city
out of nothing.

844
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,374
But we were
betrayed,

845
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,876
driven out, erased.

846
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,479
So that's all
this is about?

847
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,014
Revenge?

848
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,816
No.

849
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,351
This is about atonement.

850
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,754
The ground that
Gotham is built on

851
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,758
is poisoned by the wrongs
done to my forefathers.

852
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,326
I will change that.

853
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,095
By killing
nine random people?

854
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,863
You're insane.

855
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,198
(laughs)

856
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,533
I can see why you'd think so.

857
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,902
Ritual blood
sacrifices,

858
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,270
bunch of guys in robes

859
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,872
(laughs):
chanting prophesies.

860
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,540
It's a bit too...

861
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:50,079
But belief itself--
that's what matters, Detective.

862
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,981
Belief gives strength,

863
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,016
purpose.

864
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,420
And not all the victims
are random.

865
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:01,224
The Son of Gotham.

866
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,127
Good-bye, James.

867
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,163
I couldn't have
done it without you.

868
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,133
Ah, what the hell.

869
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,667
I have a few minutes.

870
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,902
Cut him loose.

871
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,871
(chuckles)

872
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,109
All right, Jim, give
it your best shot.

873
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,911
Save Gotham.

874
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,316
(grunts)

875
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,852
(grunts)

876
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,190
(groans)

877
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,831
(groans)

878
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,800
(shouts)

879
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,105
(panting)

880
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,973
(sniffles, sighs)

881
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,282
Kill him.

882
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,219
Don't make it quick.

883
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,996
(footsteps approaching)

884
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,731
Alfred? Is that you?

885
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,233
(door opens)
You won't believe

886
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:20,036
what I learned...

887
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,038
Sorry.

888
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,574
Not Alfred.

889
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,178
(grunting)

890
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,080
(gunshots)

891
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:34,350
(Gordon groaning)

892
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,187
(grunts)

893
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,323
Hello, Jim.

894
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:45,761
Lucky for you, Gabe had people
following Galavan.

895
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,997
Now...

896
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,899
where is he?

897
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,601
Where's Galavan?!

898
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,970
Tell me!

899
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,706
Where is Galavan?!

900
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:57,907
(grunting)

901
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,644
(yells)

902
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,816
You've shown mettle
and ingenuity,

903
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,517
my boy.

904
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,486
But that's all done with.

905
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,588
What do you want?

906
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,327
Why, your life, of course.
