2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Flight 1549, Clear to take off.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Flight 1549, Ready to take off

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Mayday, Mayday, Captain 1549, We've lost both engines

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Both engines!

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No rely on motor 2

7
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:40,024
Captain 1549, ,We can get a view on runway 148

8
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:42,148
We can't make it, We're turning back to La Guardia

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
La Guardia Tower, Flight 1549
We're going to try to make 13

10
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:05,024
Sully, We are too low

11
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,048
Sully, We are too low!

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Come on!

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
It's  set on fire!

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Come on!

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Sully

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Lory I love you!

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What the hell is the matter with you?

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everyone, EVERYONE survived on flight 1549!

19
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,024
You think you'll die, that's what you think

20
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:41,848
And then, miraculously you don't!

21
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:44,872
Thank you Captain, Thank you!

22
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,896
Thank you!

23
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Thank you Captain Sullbenger for being here today.

24
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:04,524
I would also welcome First Officer Skiles

25
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,548
Glad you made it at this point.

26
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,572
Not aswell as  we are.

27
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:12,096
For the record, we have an aircraft system investigation,

28
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
and also aircraft structures, MRT

29
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,144
Aircraft perfomance, ATCS, life factors,
survival factors

30
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,168
nd also emergency response
Today we begin

31
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,192
with our operations,human performance and investigations.

32
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,216
On the crash of US Flight 1549

33
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
The water landing.

34
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:28,764
Captain?

35
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,788
This was not a crash, it was a water landing.

36
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,812
We knew what we were trying to execute

37
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:36,536
It was not a crash, it was a forced water landing.

38
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,260
Why didn't you attempt to return
to La Guardia?

39
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,384
There was simply not enough altitude

40
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:49,908
The Hudson was the only place long enough and smooth enough and wide enough to attempt a landing.

41
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,432
Air traffic testified that you were returning to La Guardia but you did not.

42
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:57,656
As I began the left turn,

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,880
I realized I couldn't make it back
and I would have eliminated other options

44
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:04,204
Returning to La Guardia would have been a mistake.

45
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:06,728
Let's get into how you calculated all those parameters.

46
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,752
There was no time for calculating.

47
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:13,276
I have relied on my experience on managing the altitude and speed
on thousand of flights over four decades.

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,300
You say you didn't calculated...

49
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,324
I attempted.

50
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:19,348
- You attempted.

51
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,372
Yes.

52
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:24,396
The best chance passengers had was on that.

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,420
And I bet my life on it.
In fact, I did!

54
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,844
And I would do it again.

55
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:33,868
Aviation engineers theorize you had enough energy to get back to the runway.

56
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,492
Engineers are not pilots.
They're wrong.

57
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,616
And they weren't there.

58
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Regardless, we have to follow all implications
as part of the investigation.

59
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:47,664
Our computers analized scenarios

60
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:51,188
run algorithms, write
simulations with the exact parameters.

61
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:54,212
the engine loss,
the altitude, everything you faced

62
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:56,036
when you made your decision.

63
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,560
I would like to oversee those computer simulations

64
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:00,784
Not possible during the investigation.

65
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,808
You staid it was a dual engine failure

66
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,832
due to multiple blows with birds?

67
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:06,856
That would be unprecedented!

68
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Everything is unprecedented, until it happens for the first time.

69
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
How much sleep did you get the night before?

70
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,764
Eight hours, enough.

71
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,488
It was possible that blood sugar was low?

72
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,912
I was rested, alerted, and completely aware of my surroundings.

73
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,836
When was your last dring, Captain Sullenbenger?

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Nine days ago.

75
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,384
Droghe?

76
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,608
No, mai.

77
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:31,232
First Officer Skiles?

78
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,956
I don't drink, I never have.

79
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Captain,

80
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:39,504
 have you had any troubles at home lately?

81
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,528
Well, not more than anyone else.

82
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,552
And nothing that affected my work.

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Bullshit.

84
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:54,324
But why are they looking for something we did wrong?

85
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,748
That turned out right.

86
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,772
It didn't turned out right for the Airline and their insurance company.

87
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:00,996
We should expect some blowback.

88
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,220
Oh like what they can say?

89
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:04,044
That we shouldn't have saved everybody?

90
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,368
That's not personal.

91
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,392
The're just doing their job.

92
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,491
Relax, calm down.

93
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,516
Sully, they should give you a medal

94
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
and send you back to work.

95
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:14,239
Sorry, this mailbox is full.

96
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:17,464
I didn't called Lori this morning, I'm guessing someone  else did

97
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,788
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say:

98
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,112
It is an honor driving you today.

99
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:26,136
Thank you.

100
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,760
What new have said so far? Two building went down,

101
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:32,784
Many millions without work, and that's the first weeks of January.

102
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,208
But today's headlines:

103
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:37,232
This is beautiful!

104
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:43,356
Hey Mike, why don't we get the driver as a character witness?

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Finally.

106
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,024
Oh, finally.

107
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,048
The Airline has given us trapped all day.

108
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:04,572
It's just... I need to hear your voice.

109
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,596
I've heared everybody else's.

110
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

111
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:11,144
It doesn't feel much like family.

112
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
It isn't quiet here too.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,100
There are reporters asking for an update.

114
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:24,124
Inside the mind of Sully.

115
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,848
Lori, tell them you can't talk.

116
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,872
I cannot hear you, just call me later.

117
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,896
You don't have to talk with them.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Call me back.

119
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Do you've got any news?

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Have you achiedeved the impossible?

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I think there's the press with a car.

122
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:12,424
Self-Defense, think the juror would convinct?

123
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,448
Do what you have to do.

124
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,472
No, I'm asking for permission.

125
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:18,496
Cops will be coming after you.

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Sully what are you doing?

127
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Sully, are you listening to me?

128
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,464
We should talk later.

129
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,488
I've been reading all day.

130
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:35,912
Are you okay?

131
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,936
Yeah, I'm just tired, that's all.

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
How are the girls?

133
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,984
Oh good.

134
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,508
A bit overwhelmed, sounds like you are too.

135
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah, I'll be alright.

136
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
The whole world is talking about you.

137
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,064
Sully, I can't believe this.

138
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:05,088
Lori, I'll have to stay here,

139
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:08,912
Until the investigation is over, Did I tell that already?

140
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:12,136
And I apologize if I didn't told you already.

141
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
You don't need to apologize,
You're right where you need to be.

142
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:21,084
You know, I did the best I could.

143
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,108
Of course you did.

144
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,632
You saved everyone.

145
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,856
Maybe we should just talk in the morning.

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm tired.

147
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,404
I'm overwhelmed by all these attentions.

148
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:41,928
I'm gonna be on TV next Morning, what are they gonna ask me?

149
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,152
Sully do you want me to come be with you?

150
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:47,176
No Lori

151
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
The girls need you.

152
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,224
Tell them I love them.

153
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,948
I love you.

154
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,972
Get some sleep.

155
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:59,596
Yeah, maybe when I'll wake up it'll be January 14th.

156
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Wouldn't that be good?

157
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,644
I love you.

158
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Why did Captain Sully made that faithful decision to turn the Hudson into a runway?

159
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,924
Well, only he can answer.

160
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,948
But we now know, it was a wrong choice.

161
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:25,772
A choice that endangered the lives of all of those on board.

162
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:29,096
So, while much of the country hails him as a hero

163
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,020
this new information will certainly change everyone's understanding
of the so called Miracle on the Hudson

164
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:42,844
Sully Sullenberger, are you a hero,
or a fraud?

165
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,500
Hello?

166
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,524
Jeff? Sorry for calling you so late.

167
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,548
It's ok, There's no sleep in this room either.

168
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:11,772
Can you believe they charged 5 dollars for a Snickers?

169
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,696
I can take the Airline to bankruptcy with four bites.

170
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
I thought you may wanna talk!
-Absolutely

171
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,544
Let's get some air.

172
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,068
Great

173
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,492
I will be there in 5 minutes.

174
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,416
Enjoying the shakes?

175
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Nightmares? Little Heartbeat?

176
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,064
A little bit. The Union is offering us Counseling.

177
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:47,488
Yeah, what would you say? You were in a plane crash and lived.

178
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,112
It might have an impact in your day to day.

179
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,436
I don't like not being in control of the process.

180
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
I won myself that

181
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,384
Within 6 months we'll laugh about
as we know David Letterman

182
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,108
We're doing David Letterman?

183
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,132
Yeah, right after next week's interview.

184
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,856
I'm guessing David's gonna be excited for you.

185
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
This is so surreal.

186
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:17,404
I guess I'm having some problems in separating reality
 from whatever the hell this is.

187
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,728
Yeah, this is two man freezing their asses off

188
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:28,052
Sully,
Don't worry, you did a great day.

189
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,776
It's gonna be remembered for a very long time.

190
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Here's a funny thing:

191
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,924
I've delivered over a million passengers over 40 years in the air

192
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,848
But in the end I'lm gonna be judged for 208 seconds

193
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,872
Come on, tomorrow it's gonna be a good day.

194
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:49,296
Computers will prove you're right, and you'll put your wings back on

195
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
You wanna run?

196
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:53,344
Yeah, let's run.

197
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,968
Fucking cold out here.

198
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,692
This was obvious, it was a critical situation

199
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,316
Losing both engines at a low altitude

200
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Over one of the most populated areas of the planet

201
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:16,064
But you chose to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big IF

202
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,788
I was sure I could do it

203
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:20,512
You were?

204
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,136
Yes.

205
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,760
How do you feel when people call you a hero?

206
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:32,884
I don't feel like a hero.
I'm just a man who is doing his job.

207
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,708
The right man for the job
at the right time

208
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,532
You've been flying for what?
Nearly 40 years?

209
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:43,456
42, That's been my life

210
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,680
My whole life

211
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,204
Aircraft

212
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,828
Bomb-craft

213
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,820
I'll be busy son, so you
keep the plane clean please.

214
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,044
They are $ 6 per hour
Consider it a lesson time

215
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:28,268
Pilots never stop to acquire knwledge.
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.

216
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:33,192
Never forget, no matter what's happening,
to fly the airplane.

217
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,616
Absolutely, sir!

218
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
One other thing, and this is important!
Sir?

219
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,824
You can smile !

220
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,848
Alright!

221
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
I apologize for my sweating.

222
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:59,524
Oh no, After all you did I don't think
Katie could be more intimidating

223
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:04,048
Oh that wasn't Katie, It was the light
and the camera you brought in.

224
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,072
Ok, we're done.

225
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,696
That was from my mom.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,620
Her name's Brenda,
She told me to say thank you and she's single!

227
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:17,844
Well, tell Brenda thank you,
but I got a girl at home.

228
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:19,868
Lucky woman

229
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sully, SULLY!

230
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:04,424
Sully, where are you?

231
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:06,448
I'm standing here calling your name.

232
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,472
What's up with you?

233
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:17,696
You need to get focused, because the media
requests Avalanche continues.

234
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,420
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:24,644
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in and run Shotgun
 with you the rest of the way

236
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,668
Thought you might need a friend.

237
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,692
He will take you to NTSB now.

238
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,716
AirBus completed computer simulations aswell

239
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Good, Good, that will help!

240
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,764
There's something else

241
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:42,688
The Agency called,
The left engine was still operating

242
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:47,112
Not possible, I felt it go.
It was like it stopped in mid-air.

243
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,136
They said there's a chance it was sub-idle.

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm just letting you know, since
the NTSB already does.

245
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
You've got to be kidding me.

246
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:32,024
Our job is to investigate.
Our plane ended up in the Hudson River.

247
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,280
Isn't it a little bit early for you
to go fishing?

248
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,704
Searching facts is not exactly go fishing, Mr Skiles,

249
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:46,328
Let's see the most important fact:
There were only two people who know what happened

250
00:18:46,352 --> 00:18:48,352
in the cockpit that day,
and I'm one of them.

251
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,576
And we appreciate your perspective.

252
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Why are we here today?

253
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:56,524
Is it because Captain Sullenberger
did not return to La Guardia?

254
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:04,248
Look, I just finished training on the AR320,
And I can tell you the only reason the plane operated so well

255
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:09,072
Is because the Captain turned on
The auxiliary power unit on

256
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:11,096
He simply followed the QRH

257
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,420
No, no he wasn't.
He wasn't following proper procedure at all.

258
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,444
And I know because I had the QRH in my hands.

259
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:23,368
He switched to APU immediately after engine blowback.
According to the Airbus that's the 15th thing to do.

260
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,992
If he followed the damn rules, we would be dead.

261
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:33,716
Maybe that's the part you don't like.
You have answers to your guessing

262
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,840
Look, he's just saying that I held the AR320 what it does
and  what it does to do

263
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:48,664
I held recountless CVR transcripts of deceased pilots and I have
significant accident investigation experience.

264
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:55,188
There is no question that you're a talented,
dedicated, experienced professional.

265
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:04,112
Every crash investigated before are not object of this investigation.
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

266
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:12,500
Your Union has been advised, The data relate that the
left engine continued setting himself on during flight.

267
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:14,524
Then the Data is wrong

268
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:19,948
The evidence showed that the engine was Idle or Sub-Idle
immediately following the bird strike.

269
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:23,572
You show me the left engine
I show you dead birds and no power

270
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:27,896
The left engine was lost in the crash,
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

271
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
We could circle back to that later,

272
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,344
Let's just assume, as you say,
a dual engine loss.

273
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:46,768
Your weight was 151.510 pounds, wind and temperature, nort, north-west, 21 degrees,
speed and altitude 200 nods and 2818 feet.

274
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,792
Correct.

275
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:57,316
The computer simulations of US Airways Flight 1549 showed that
 the Aviation Engineers were correct.

276
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,040
There was enough speed and altitude after the bird strike
for a succesful return to La Guardia

277
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,064
Succesful?

278
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:11,588
The plane landed at LaGuardia intact, undamaged.

279
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,612
You got that from one computer simulation?

280
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,636
No, 20.

281
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:27,560
Including attempts made from LaGuardia runways.
Every Computer simulation with the exact flight parameters

282
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:32,284
demonstrated that return to LaGuardia was possible.
And not just possible, probable.

283
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Does anyone here needs further computer evidence?

284
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,304
Captain Sullenberger?

285
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,328
First Officer Skiles?

286
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,700
Not this time.
I would like to go over the parameters.

287
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:55,924
We'll make them available for the Union.

288
00:21:55,948 --> 00:22:01,848
And once the Investigation is complete,
we'll be able to share the actual computer simulations

289
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:06,072
For now, they remain confidential.
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

290
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:09,296
There has been far too much talk for the press already.

291
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:22,100
When the complete cockpit voice is compiled, alongside with onboard
transcripts we'll call you back .

292
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:25,224
Thank you gentlemen.
Good day.

293
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:28,948
Thank you.

294
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
We weren't playing Pac-Man, we were flying a plane for human beings.

295
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:46,824
Some other, will have to remember it.
This just doesn't seem right

296
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:51,748
It's because this is not right
You did everything you could, that's more than enough.

297
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:55,772
Ask your passengers, Ask your wife and kids.
Ask Lori

298
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
So what's the first thing you heard from the cockpit?

299
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:25,224
Brace for impact

300
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,448
Now, ever heard of that before?

301
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,472
No, actually no

302
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Ever heard of that in any aspect of your life?

303
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Take this show away from me.

304
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:56,424
Jeff was relaxed and fine.
He should be getting over with other requests.

305
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,548
Are they paying you?
For all this media stuff at least?

306
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,072
No payment is necessary.

307
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,096
Oh, I wish the bank felt the same way

308
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Why? What do you mean?

309
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:10,144
That's just....
We got another notice.

310
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:12,168
About the Space in View County.

311
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:17,992
Well, we'll find a tenant.
It just takes time.

312
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:21,316
You've been saying that for 9 months, Sully
It's still vacant

313
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
The economy has to take a turn.

314
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:27,664
It feels like, if we lose that space, the next
thing will be the house.

315
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:31,188
Lori, we're not gonna lose the house.

316
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:33,212
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:39,836
I'm sorry, I'm just anxious, and alone and
not enough sleep.

318
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,360
Yeah, I didn't get enough sleep either.

319
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:47,084
I'm sorry adding to your stress but,
Just tell me you'll be back soon.

320
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:51,008
Well not until the NTSB has finished
the investigation.

321
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,032
We need you flying.

322
00:24:53,056 --> 00:25:00,956
Lori, If this goes wrong, my career as safety expert, will end,
as the website and the business card.

323
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,580
I'm more worried about your career as a pilot.

324
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:09,504
What if I did blow this?

325
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,528
What are you saying?

326
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:15,852
What if I did things wrong, closing my career?

327
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:19,976
If I endangered the lives of those passengers.

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Sully, Watch the news!

329
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,824
You're a hero!

330
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:28,448
And everyone is going to get used to it,
Including the NTSB.

331
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,072
First case scenario:
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

332
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,996
That's immediate retirement, no pension.

333
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
My life is done.

334
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:41,544
Ok you're scaring me now, Sully.
What's going on?

335
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,868
The left engine might have still been idle-ing.

336
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:51,692
And the AirBus Simulations said I could still have made it back
to La Guardia safely.

337
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,116
But it doesn't make sense.

338
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,040
That's in discussion with everything I felt in the cockpit.

339
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:01,664
Then why did you do that Sully?

340
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:07,488
A land in the water?
That's not the much dangerous thing you could have done!

341
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Good afternoon.

342
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,124
The Tuna Vasel or The Heaven Shatter.

343
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,148
Tuna Vasel, Very Fresh!

344
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:29,072
Thank you

345
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:32,296
Too cold today, too much cold!

346
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,920
When are you gonna come fly with me?

347
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:36,944
When U.S. Airways starts to fly to Hidro-Bar.

348
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:40,968
I will talk, see if can work.

349
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,592
This is Thursday!

350
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:52,016
Suitcase is already stuffed with gifts for Will.

351
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,840
Always fun to get things in the Airport.
Seems you travel too.

352
00:26:55,864 --> 00:27:00,264
Mom, he's turning 1.
Don't think he can know what gift came from where.

353
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,288
But I will.

354
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,312
Maybe a Snow Globe.

355
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:08,536
Something he will remember.
Something from New York.

356
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,035
You forgot when we were kids?

357
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,660
Okay sweetheart, I'll get you a Snow Globe too.

358
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:14,684
Fine. Come on.

359
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:28,508
Good afternoon.

360
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:30,532
Captain.

361
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:42,056
Hey guys, Jeff!
We're not gonna make it!

362
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,880
I believed in you for this trip,
Just meet us at the Gate ok?

363
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:51,604
Altimeters verified, 3023.

364
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,628
3023.

365
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,152
Checklist complete.

366
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:05,276
You really think there are recess?

367
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,400
Checking the latests reports, We could
make it all the way to Charlotte.

368
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:14,124
From steaks to Frisco, on me.

369
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:17,348
I've never been.And I hear good things

370
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:20,772
Oh, Rhubarb will break your heart.

371
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:24,096
Yeah, I'm more like Porker House man.

372
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Porker House will stop your heart.

373
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:32,844
Wait, Wait Wait!

374
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:40,068
Hi, I'm sorry, Spirit sent us.
We cancelled and you said you have seats.

375
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,092
Flight is closed.

376
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:44,116
Wait, see that guy, looking up there?

377
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,640
That's my Dad, it's an emergency.
He's got to be on this flight.

378
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,664
Okay, everybody say the same.

379
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,188
Golf emergency.
Did it go cancelled?

380
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:54,612
IDs please.

381
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:57,536
How many travelling?
3.

382
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,960
Nothing together.
We'll find a way.

383
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:08,384
Here we go: 22A, 6A and 6C

384
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,408
Thank you so much!

385
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Glad you made it!

386
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,500
You're on 6 Jeff.
Oh no that's Jimmy, I'm gonna get some sleep.

387
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:28,924
Are you going to sleep here?
Not close to you.

388
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,948
Yo, yo, Goodnight!

389
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,572
Sorry, Excuse Me.

390
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Yeah, of course.

391
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,140
I'm sorry, he likes to throw everything.
That's perfect, I like to catch everything.

392
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:59,964
I googled you last night.
Found you on the company's website.

393
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:04,488
That's impressive.
Thanks.

394
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:10,512
I thought I was a good bullshitter, but you!
You could go Pro!

395
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:20,336
Just kidding, but your site do not worry
 about 100 employees and headquarters in 3 states

396
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,260
When searching for more, I realized that it was just you.

397
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:28,584
Now, go easy. I'm just getting it done.

398
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,108
I've never been acused being a bullshitter.

399
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,632
Do not misunderstand!
It is a compliment.

400
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,956
Now, with that website, I know you!

401
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,780
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board
US Airways Flight 1549.

402
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:53,104
Get sure to follow the safety instructions card on seatback in front of you,
explains safety features on thi aircraft, aswell as locations of emergency exits.

403
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,580
La Guardia, this is 1549, ready for clearance

404
00:30:58,604 --> 00:31:02,204
Ok 1549, 128 ready and protected.

405
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Get sure to turn that off.

406
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Just once I'd like to go to La Guardia in time.

407
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:37,724
Well you know hot to get to La Guardia.

408
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:39,748
No, what's that?

409
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,772
Fly at JFK.

410
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Take-out fuel quality verified.

411
00:31:55,324 --> 00:32:00,124
19000 Cargo aboard.

412
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:02,148
Captain's 1549, Runway 4, Clear to take-off.

413
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,872
Captain's 1549,  Clear to take-off.

414
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Positive rig

415
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Nice view on the Hudson

416
00:32:57,324 --> 00:33:00,324
I can't get over on how beautiful is up here.

417
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,348
Life's easier in the air.

418
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:04,372
I guess, it is.

419
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:07,396
BIRDS!

420
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh shit!

421
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
I'm worried, what's going on?

422
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:34,424
It's okay.

423
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:37,448
It might be a good idea to keep your seatbelts on.

424
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
We've got one rolling back.

425
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,600
We have both rolling back.

426
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Ignition start.

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Restarting APU.

428
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Just double check your seatbelts please.

429
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Seatbelts.

430
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,200
What do you think it was?
I think it was a bird strike.

431
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:27,224
We'll have to turn back to La Guardia.
Yeah.

432
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,848
Get out the QRH

433
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,872
We've lost both engines.

434
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,896
Mayday, mayday this is Captain 1549, we hit birds.

435
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,520
We've lost both engines, we're turning back to La Guardia.

436
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,544
Ok, you need to return to La Guardia?

437
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:44,568
Turn left at 220.

438
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:46,592
Which engine did you lose?

439
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,616
Both, both engines.

440
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Soup, I have an emergency.

441
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,964
What's the report?

442
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:56,988
Both engines, both engines gone.

443
00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:03,712
LaGuardia says go to runway 13

444
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:09,236
Tower, stop your departures, we've got an emergency returning.
Flight 1549, bird strike.

445
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
We've lost both engines, return immediately.

446
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,284
He lost both engines.

447
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:18,008
Captain 1549, if you can get a view, do you want to try land on runway 13?

448
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:22,056
We are unable. We'll end up in the Hudson.

449
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,880
I've got an A320 diving in the river.
Al, stack the inbounds in La Guardia.

450
00:35:27,904 --> 00:35:29,904
Let's put a load in the Tower please.

451
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:38,028
I need a runway, Captain 1549 needs to get in an airport right now.

452
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:42,052
Newer Tower, what did you got?
Runway 29 ready. Need an emergency landing?

453
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,076
Yes, I'll be right side as Ftaburogh

454
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Shit.

455
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,740
This is the Captain
Brace for impact.

456
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:59,764
What?
Brace, Brace, Brace

457
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:01,788
Heads down, stay down!

458
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:04,312
Brace, Brace, Brace

459
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:06,936
Heads down, stay down!

460
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,860
Captain 1549, turn right to 3-0.
You can land on run way 1 0 now.

461
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:13,884
That's negative, We're landing in the Hudson.

462
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,908
I'm sorry, say again?

463
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:24,132
Captain 1549, radar contact lost.

464
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:26,156
IC, come on over here.

465
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,080
I've got also a newer copy at 2 o'clock, about 7 miles.

466
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,900
Captain 1549, if you can, you got runway 29
available at 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

467
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm sorry Patrick.

468
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:56,424
No, he's about to Newark, he's just out of the box.

469
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,448
Hook'em back up.

470
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:01,372
We need authorized news.

471
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,696
Attention all aircraft in vicinity of JW,

472
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,100
We see the USS ship...
1549, low over the Hudson

473
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:19,124
I got eyes on him

474
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:22,748
Ok
Hang on the chopper visuals.

475
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:25,172
He's out there.

476
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:29,896
He's heading to Newark, 7 miles.
Only 7 miles.

477
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,320
Captain's 1549, this is Departure Control,
On Guard, do you read?

478
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,444
It's going down

479
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Captain's 1549, do you read me?

480
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:46,324
Shit, it's going down!
It's gonna hit the water!

481
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Testers are gonna come down.

482
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,824
Meet Eliza, it's the standard.

483
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:01,748
His voice was so calm!

484
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:05,372
When he said the Hudson, I wouldn't believe it!

485
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,996
This isn't happening.

486
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,720
We have took out survivors on water landings, didn't we?

487
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Embrace

488
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I better go.

489
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:40,024
I am so sorry.
I love you.

490
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:43,248
Yeah, I gotta go.

491
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,320
Choosing to land in the Hudson was a big IF!

492
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:39,044
The evidence showed that a return to LaGuardia was possible.
The left engine was sub-idle

493
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,600
This is tasty 11
I have an emergency landing by breakdown

494
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:23,624
Roger that.

495
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:25,648
Looks like hydraulics.

496
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,672
Sir, we need to catch up.

497
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:29,696
Running a control test.

498
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
We need more altitude.

499
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Tower, this is Tacy 11 with flight control

500
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:48,164
Roger that, turn left for 2-2-0

501
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,188
Unable

502
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:54,012
Okay, proceed straight for about 2 1

503
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,436
2 1, thanks a lot

504
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
2 1, Increasing speed

505
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,584


506
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
One, you look free to fly, no trace of smoke

507
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:15,024
Roger that 2

508
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:17,048
I copied, I approach runway 21

509
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:19,072
Following you in

510
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
We're heading 0-2-0

511
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,924
Ok, you're free

512
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,248
Tasty 11, check your speed.

513
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:44,172
I repeat, maintain control.

514
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:46,196
Avoiding to stall.

515
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,320
1, check your heading.
You're not going to make the runway!

516
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,344
I got it.

517
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
That was a hell of a landing sir!

518
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:16,724
Didn't think we were gonna make it!

519
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm gonna start charging for this stuff, alright?

520
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,024
Hear me?

521
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:56,148
Hey, let me know if you need anything.

522
00:42:56,972 --> 00:43:03,172
TV: What seems incredible is that
all passengers in the plane survived!

523
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:09,096
Hey, is that you?

524
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,420
Are you a pilot? Sully?
This is you, right?

525
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:16,844
It's a pleasure to meet you.

526
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:23,668
That was unreal what you did last day.
It's a real pleasure to meet you

527
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:28,292
We got a drink after you, as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right Manny?

528
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:38,016
Yeah yeah, you did!
The Sully! A shot of Grey Goose, with a splash of water.

529
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,240
To January 15th!

530
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:49,264
Best day in the year!

531
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:59,188
Hey Pete, Sully's here, and he's there!

532
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:01,212
He's everywhere!

533
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:08,636
He's a real hero man!

534
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Keep coming, let's see how  they want!

535
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:29,724
No more people on board Cap,that's what it takes for GW

536
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:31,748
Alright, thanks. Roger that.

537
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:35,472
We're heading into Midtown in Sub-7.

538
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,500
I cannot believe you had to sat to say that.

539
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,224
I'd say it again, and with no question or hesitation.
It was the best picture in history of baseball.

540
00:44:58,248 --> 00:45:01,748
Are you lying about the Lakers, is that what it is?
Or is it the mustache?

541
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:03,772
You're just jealous!

542
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:05,796
Jealous!?!

543
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Brace, Brace!

544
00:45:45,024 --> 00:45:47,024
Heads down, stay down!

545
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,048
It's ok.

546
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:51,072
Stay down!

547
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't wanna die!

548
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Evacuate!

549
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:01,224
Grab your life vests please

550
00:47:01,248 --> 00:47:03,248
Opening door.

551
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
Confused screams....

552
00:47:19,844 --> 00:47:24,544
Everyone, exits are usable. Move forward to your closest exit!

553
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,100
Move forward.
On the right there's an exit door.

554
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Sir, Evacuate the plane right now!

555
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Calm down, you'll be fine!

556
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Here, it's gonna be cold out there.

557
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,000
Jump!
Jump!

558
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh my god!

559
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,524
We have to jump..no no Wait!

560
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Can you see this?
Yeah

561
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:24,824
Oh Christ, that's a plane.

562
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,100
Mayday Mayday, Channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.
We have a passenger airliner in the north river!

563
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:39,124
We're in route, we will advise!

564
00:49:39,148 --> 00:49:41,148
Let's go, Let's go!

565
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,400
Jimmy, Jeff has not got out.
We can't leave him there!

566
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:04,424
We've got him, We've got him!

567
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,048
He will be okay!

568
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Keep moving forward!

569
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:23,224
Follow the instructions!

570
00:50:31,548 --> 00:50:33,848
Sir, Sir! Can you come help us?

571
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Everyone keep moving forward!

572
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,240
The plane's down, we got passengers on the wings.

573
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,264
Approach with caution

574
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Put a blanket on her legs

575
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:26,824
You will be fine honey, go slowly

576
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:30,848
Wrap this around her leg, make it tight.

577
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,072
It's so cold out here.

578
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,400
Starting approaching, we're nearly there.

579
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Pick it up.

580
00:51:56,424 --> 00:51:58,424
Alright

581
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:05,348
3-2-1. It's good It's good!

582
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Right there baby, Come on.

583
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,440
One at a time.
We'll get everybody!

584
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
We're getting them on the other way.

585
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
A little bit closer!

586
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,340
With a water temperature of 36 degrees and a windshield of -5

587
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:07,364
the survivors of flight 1549 literally have managed to live.

588
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,900
Get up here, there are other good people coming right away, ok?

589
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
50 yards, GO!

590
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'll keep you like that ok?
Ok.

591
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,240
Someone is still here, Come back.
Help me!

592
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Captain!

593
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:31,424
Captain, We have to go!

594
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:33,448
Time to get off the plane, about now!

595
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Alright let's go. GO!

596
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:49,224
I'll be right behind.

597
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Sully, we got to go!

598
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Everybody's okay?

599
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:44,200
All of them miraculously survived and they found
300 New Yorkers ready to help them

600
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,224
The only question remaining is: Will it be too late?

601
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:49,848
In Manhattan Bobby Cuza, New York One

602
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:51,872
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on.

603
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I was sure I was gonna die.

604
00:56:11,024 --> 00:56:13,024
Hey, no one dies today, ok?

605
00:56:15,848 --> 00:56:17,848
Give me your hand

606
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,200
There you go Captain, this way!

607
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:29,224
Give me your hands sir!

608
00:56:38,848 --> 00:56:41,748
We'll need more blankets over here!

609
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,772
Thank you, Thank you

610
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,696
Yeah, we got them all!

611
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Hello?

612
00:57:11,024 --> 00:57:13,024
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

613
00:57:13,048 --> 00:57:15,048
Oh good, are you still far away from home?

614
00:57:15,472 --> 00:57:20,472
There's been an incident.
I'm okay, I just crashed somehow.

615
00:57:20,496 --> 00:57:22,496
Turn on the television

616
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,520
What do you mean, turn on the television?

617
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:28,044
Lori I can't talk right now, I'll
call you when things calm down.

618
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:31,768
I had to land on the Hudson.

619
00:57:32,192 --> 00:57:34,992
Sully, I don't understand

620
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:39,416
I love you and I'm ok, tell the girls I'm ok!

621
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,540
I have to go!

622
00:57:44,264 --> 00:57:46,264
Girls turn on the TV

623
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:55,488
An extensive rescue after a US Airway flight has crashed into the Hudson River.

624
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:57,512
Oh my God.

625
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,400
Take your wet clothes off and wrap it up for the Red Cross.

626
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
You'll be okay.

627
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Jeff!

628
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,324
Sully!

629
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,680
I need a damage report, how badly and I need it NOW!

630
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:01,904
155. That's my number, that's passengers included.

631
00:59:01,928 --> 00:59:03,928
Ok, How are you?

632
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:05,952
I'll answer that question when you'll count 155.

633
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,976
Alright,

634
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,700
I'm alive. Shary, I can't believe I'm talking to you.

635
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,500
Captain, Captain I'm here to escort you to Mayor Bloomber and Police Officers.

636
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,524
If the Mayor want  to say hello,he'll have to come down here.

637
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:32,548
Sully, I refused to send you with a cop!

638
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:36,972
Jeff! I need a count!
We've got to have a count!

639
00:59:36,996 --> 00:59:38,996
There's no way to give you a count.

640
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,220
Let's get you a drive before you freeze.

641
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:44,544
Captain, the Mayor and Chief McKelly, come down here to meet you.

642
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:46,868
I can't, because it was a domestic flight!

643
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:51,092
Yeah, we have no doubts, but we have to track the passengers informations down.
One by one!

644
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:53,116
Ok, can we help?

645
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,140
Yeah, I'm gonna call and get you a count!

646
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:57,564
Listen, you've done enough.
Let me take this for you!

647
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Jeff!

648
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:13,624
I'm okay.
I was on the other wing.

649
01:00:13,648 --> 01:00:15,648
They brought us to Jersey!

650
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:18,072
I couldn't see you.
I couldn't find you!

651
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:20,096
I could hear you shouted my name all time.

652
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,720
I shouted too, I don't know, I guess the river....

653
01:00:23,744 --> 01:00:25,744
Are you okay?

654
01:00:26,268 --> 01:00:28,568
I love you too.

655
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,792
We made it!

656
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:35,916
The plane.... the plane's crashed!

657
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,940
On the river!

658
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,964
Are you kidding me?

659
01:00:42,588 --> 01:00:45,488
Oh, that's unbelievable!

660
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,120
I've never been so happy to be in New York in all my life!

661
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Hey Betty!

662
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Ain't you coming?

663
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:25,424
I guess he didn't hear.

664
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,448
I lost Captain 1549 in the Hudson.

665
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:30,972
Yeah, I guess you had a hurry, he hadn't, the son of a bitch!

666
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:32,996
Everyone's been pulled off!

667
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,020
It's a miracle!

668
01:01:35,944 --> 01:01:37,944
I thought I lost them all.

669
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Are my passengers alright?

670
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:46,724
Yes, 110.

671
01:01:47,848 --> 01:01:52,048
110. That's not good!

672
01:01:52,072 --> 01:01:54,072
It's alright, what do you mean it's not good?

673
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:58,596
Don't worry, 110 is extraordinary!

674
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,620
How is Dureene?

675
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:04,044
Farly severe laceration, but we'll keep
handling her infection.

676
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,068
I'm sure he'll be ok.

677
01:02:06,092 --> 01:02:08,092
Has a scar, and a hell of a story to tell.

678
01:02:08,116 --> 01:02:11,516
If someone believes it, I'm seeing it right now,
and i can't believe it.

679
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,540
You landed a plane on the Hudson without a scratch...

680
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,564
Erny...

681
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:17,888
The Union is pulling out all the big guns today...

682
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:21,612
You took a damn risk Sully.

683
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:23,636
Got a count.

684
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,660
155

685
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:29,684
155?

686
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:31,708
It's official.

687
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,320
Oh, 155.

688
01:02:39,344 --> 01:02:41,344
Thank you Erny.

689
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,680
Hey Carl!
Yes?

690
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:17,704
Sully.
Carl.

691
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:19,728
You didn't blown up today, did you?

692
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,752
We're here, that's all I know at the moment.

693
01:03:21,776 --> 01:03:23,776
Oh This is Miss May, from the Hotel.

694
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Would like to have a quick word with you.

695
01:03:25,824 --> 01:03:28,224
This won't take much time gentlemen, this only to say

696
01:03:28,248 --> 01:03:30,248
that our staff is committed to protect your privacy.

697
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,272
If there's something you need, at all...

698
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:34,296


699
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,320
If it's possible, I'd like to have my uniform cleaned and ready.

700
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:45,144
Are you kidding?
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could!

701
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:52,568
Okay, well Thank you Ella.
Thank you very much.

702
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:54,592
Well, anything for Sully!

703
01:03:56,816 --> 01:03:58,816
What just happened?

704
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,840
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

705
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,164
Ah come on Sully!

706
01:04:04,088 --> 01:04:08,788
When was the last time you heard someone
landing a jetplane on the water?

707
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:10,912
And finally lived?

708
01:04:12,336 --> 01:04:14,336
Exactly.

709
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:22,160
I got shaving cream, razor blades, two pairs and some clothes.

710
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:24,184
Do you think we're ninjas?

711
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:30,008
It's seven o'clock in the evening.
You find the Merch Brothers!

712
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,032
Yeah.

713
01:04:32,056 --> 01:04:34,056
Sully.

714
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,080
What are you still doing in uniform?

715
01:04:36,104 --> 01:04:38,104
Well, I don't know.

716
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,628
Look guys, it's been a long day.
Why don't you just get some rest?

717
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:45,652
Mike will be here later to make sure you ok!

718
01:04:45,676 --> 01:04:47,676
Thank you Carl.

719
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
No, thank you Captain.

720
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:52,124
You know, it's been awhile since
New York had news so good.

721
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,148
Especially with airplanes.

722
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'll see you later Sully.

723
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
The word's city officials keep repeating....

724
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,840
And of course the precise timing of the pilot

725
01:05:41,864 --> 01:05:45,264
Captain Sully Sullenbenger, the man who had almost no time

726
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:48,888
Became a man for all time.

727
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Hey Sully, give me....

728
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,900
Come on, answer...

729
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,000
Larry, the CBR is in 2 days.
How fast can you interfere?

730
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:22,024
Sully?

731
01:06:22,048 --> 01:06:26,248
I know Airbus has simulations for A320 manifacturer,
but that's next week.

732
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,272
Can you get them to reschedule?

733
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:30,296
On 3 in the morning?

734
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,920
I need you to make it happen, before
we listen to the CBR.

735
01:06:32,944 --> 01:06:34,944
Before the testimony is complete.

736
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:36,968
Why?

737
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:40,792
I have a right to see these simulation, and I have a feeling that with a human pilot

738
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:42,816
 and not a computer, the results would be different.

739
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,540
What if they show the exact same result?

740
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:49,164
If they do, I'll hang myself in.

741
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:53,588
It's everything about timing Larry.
You can accomplish anything in a hurry.

742
01:06:53,612 --> 01:06:55,612
Sure as hell I agree with that.

743
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:59,136
Now the CBR is on Wednesday, that's 36 hours.
Can you make it happen?

744
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,160
I'll try.
I'll give a phone call.

745
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:05,584
It's already late, so you better get started.
Thank you Larry.

746
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,080
Hey Lory

747
01:07:28,104 --> 01:07:30,304
Hi. I'm sorry bothering you.

748
01:07:30,328 --> 01:07:32,328
Sweetheart, what... What happened?

749
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:43,952
I just realized that there were 155 people on that plane,
and you were one of them

750
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,276
We almost lost you.

751
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,400
Yeah, but you didn't.
I'm right here.

752
01:07:51,424 --> 01:07:54,324
How are you holding up?

753
01:07:55,548 --> 01:07:58,548
Please tell me that this is almost over.

754
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,572
It's almost over.

755
01:08:00,596 --> 01:08:02,596
Okay.

756
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,620
I love you.

757
01:08:04,644 --> 01:08:06,644
I love you too

758
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:08,668
I'll call you when they're done with me.

759
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,920
Good Morning Sully.

760
01:08:50,944 --> 01:08:53,944
Alright, Good Morning ladies and Gentlemen.
My name is Charles Porter

761
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:58,368
I've been assigned from the National Transportation Safety
in order to conduct this hearing today

762
01:08:58,392 --> 01:09:01,192
We have a lot of material to cover.

763
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:07,916
But before we hear to the cockpit voice recording,
we will listen for the first time with you Gentlemen.

764
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:16,340
For the request of Captain Sullenberger and the Union,
AirBus has agreed to view pilot simulations.

765
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:18,364
Upload link, please.

766
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:23,288
Those simulations Sully, won't change my mind about
what happened up there.

767
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Birds!

768
01:09:37,224 --> 01:09:39,224
Number 1 is on rollback!

769
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:41,248
Auto-pilot's off.

770
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:43,272
Pilot off.

771
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,960
Flight director's off.

772
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,080
LaGuardia, due to engine failure, we have to return

773
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:51,604
Ok, I'm gonna turn left to LaGuardia on 3.

774
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:53,628
Activated the approach for you.

775
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:55,652
Activated.

776
01:09:55,676 --> 01:09:57,676
Runway 13

777
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
Let's get down nicely.

778
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
*ALARM*
Too low.

779
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,900
Succesful landing at La Guardia.
Runway 13

780
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
For the record: The pilot's and the computer's simulations made the same result.

781
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:41,624
Second upload please, about the second run?

782
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Birds.

783
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Give me a heading in 3-1-0

784
01:10:54,324 --> 01:10:56,324
Heading 3-1-0.

785
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
1 thousand.

786
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Flaps too

787
01:11:11,024 --> 01:11:13,024
Flaps too.

788
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,480
*ALARM* Too low

789
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Succesful landing, runway 19

790
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,840
Multiple airports, runways, two succesful landings

791
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:47,064
We are simply seeing what the computer already told us.

792
01:11:47,088 --> 01:11:50,988
A lot of toes  were stepped on in order to set this up for today.

793
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:56,412
But frankly, I really don't know what you gentlemen play the game by.

794
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,436
Can we get serious now?

795
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,260
Captain?

796
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:07,384
We've all heard about the computer simulations and now
we were watching for actual simulations but

797
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:09,408
I can't quite believe.

798
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:14,832
You simply haven't taken into account human factor.

799
01:12:14,856 --> 01:12:18,256
Human pilot simulations showed that you could have made it back to the airport.

800
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,280
No, they don't.

801
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:26,204
These pilots were not behaving like human beings.
Like people who were experiencing this for the first time.

802
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:28,228
But they made up on reacting like you did.

803
01:12:28,252 --> 01:12:33,152
Immediately after the bird strike they were turning back to the airport.
Correct?

804
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:35,176
That is correct.

805
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,100
They knew where to turn, and exactly knew where to fly.

806
01:12:38,124 --> 01:12:40,124
They did not run a check, they did not turn on the APU

807
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:42,948
There were all the same paremeters that you faced.

808
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,972
No one warned us.

809
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:51,696
No one said : You are going to lose both engines
at a lower altitude that any jet in the history.

810
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:58,520
But be cool, make just a left turn to La Guardia like
you're going back to pick up the milk.

811
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:10,844
This was a dual engine loss at 2800 feet followed by immediate water landing.
155 souls on board, no one ever trained for an incident like that.

812
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:12,868
No one!

813
01:13:12,892 --> 01:13:18,892
In the TeterBoro landing, with that unrealistick back angle,
we were not to find birds up there.

814
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:24,516
I'd like to know how many times the pilots practiced that
maneuvre before actually put it off.

815
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,400
I'm not questioning the pilots, they're good pilots.

816
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,540
But they were clearly instructed to head back to the airport
immediately after the bird strike.

817
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:38,464
You would have no time to analyze this decision.

818
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:42,288
In these simulations you take all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

819
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:49,212
How much time did the pilots had to prepare for this event, for these simulations?

820
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You were looking for human air.

821
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,060
Then make it human.

822
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,840
This wasn't a videogame.

823
01:14:04,864 --> 01:14:06,864
It was life and death.

824
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:09,388
Sully's right, that's worth a few seconds.

825
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:12,612
Please ask practicers how much they had.

826
01:14:12,636 --> 01:14:14,636
17

827
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
17?

828
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:32,024
The pilot who landed at TeterBoro had 17 practice attempt, before the simulation we just witnessed.

829
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,880
Your reaction-decision time is 35 seconds.

830
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,300
35 seconds is not our time.

831
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:48,724
We only had 208 second total so....
I'll take it.

832
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:52,248
Upload link, return to La Guardia.

833
01:14:52,272 --> 01:14:55,772
Now we added 35 seconds to response time.

834
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,960
Birds!

835
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:03,984
Gas off.

836
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:06,008
35 seconds.

837
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Time's up.

838
01:15:13,224 --> 01:15:15,224
Here we go.

839
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Going for 13.

840
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
We're right ahead for the airport.

841
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

842
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:47,024
We're about 7 miles away.

843
01:15:47,048 --> 01:15:49,048
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

844
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
*ALARM* Terrain! Terrain!

845
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,240
*ALARM* Too low! Terrain!

846
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Let's try Teterboro.

847
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:42,224
Upload the link please.

848
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,480
Birds!

849
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:50,504
Flight Director off.

850
01:16:50,528 --> 01:16:52,528
35 seconds.

851
01:16:53,052 --> 01:16:55,552
Engine 1 and 2 fail.

852
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,760
Let's see if we can make it.

853
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
Way too low.

854
01:17:22,824 --> 01:17:24,824
*ALARM* Obstacle! Obstacle!

855
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,380
Does anyone need to see any more simulations?

856
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,200
Now that we seen what could have happened, can we listen at what we actually did?

857
01:18:11,724 --> 01:18:15,324
We will look at other results in another date.

858
01:18:15,348 --> 01:18:17,348
Elizabeth.

859
01:18:17,372 --> 01:18:26,072
For the record, this is the CVR of the Flight 1549, January 15th, 2009.

860
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Birds!

861
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
Shit!

862
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,640
We got one rolling back

863
01:19:12,464 --> 01:19:15,264
We've got both of them rolling back.

864
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,880
Ignition start.

865
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,400
Get out the QRH.

866
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:42,424
Lost both engines.

867
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:48,148
Mayday Mayday, we lost both engines, we're turning to La Guardia.

868
01:19:48,172 --> 01:19:51,172
Okay you need to turn to La Guardia?
Turn left at 220.

869
01:19:51,196 --> 01:19:53,196
Which engine did you loose?

870
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,220
Both, both engines.

871
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,400
Check those flight ignition.

872
01:20:06,424 --> 01:20:08,424
Ignition?
Ignition.

873
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:10,448
Thrust lighters. Idle?
Idle.

874
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,620
Captain 1549, you want to try land on runway 13?

875
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:24,444
We are unable, we're trying to land on the Hudson.

876
01:20:25,768 --> 01:20:28,868
Emergency power. Emergency generators not online.
Not online.

877
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,900
Captain's 1549, it's gonna be runway 31.
Unable

878
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:41,924
Okay, where do you need to land?

879
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
You've got 10 seconds Captain. Talk to me.

880
01:21:00,824 --> 01:21:05,924
Captain 1549, runway 4 is available.

881
01:21:05,948 --> 01:21:07,948
I don't think we can make any runway.

882
01:21:07,972 --> 01:21:11,172
Anything in New Jersey, maybe TeterBoro?

883
01:21:11,196 --> 01:21:13,196
I'll be right side with TeterBoro Airport.

884
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:16,820
La Guardia Departure? Got an emergency inbound.

885
01:21:16,844 --> 01:21:22,344
Captain 1549, he's going at the airport right now.

886
01:21:22,368 --> 01:21:24,368
You got an emergency?

887
01:21:24,392 --> 01:21:26,392
Yeah, bird strike, Can I get runway 1-1?

888
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,200
Captain 1549, wanna try with Teterboro?

889
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:47,124
*ALARM* Obstacle, obstacle.
Pull up!

890
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
*ALARM* Too low, terrain!

891
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,940
This is the Captain, brace for impact!

892
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,000
Captain 1549 turn right to 3-0. You can land on 1-0!

893
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:30,024
We can't make it.

894
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Go ahead and try number 1.

895
01:22:35,604 --> 01:22:37,604
We're going to end up in the Hudson.

896
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
All right, let's put the flaps down, flaps down.

897
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,240
Couple of flaps, want more?

898
01:23:20,264 --> 01:23:21,564
No, it's good.

899
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,500
You got runway 2-9 at Newark, it's gonna be 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

900
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,300
You got any ideas?

901
01:23:26,324 --> 01:23:28,324
Actually not.

902
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'd need to take a quick break.

903
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,400
What do they think?

904
01:24:52,824 --> 01:24:54,824
Seeing what I just done?

905
01:24:56,748 --> 01:24:58,748
I'll tell you what I think.

906
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,720
I'm just so damn proud.

907
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:07,044
You were right there, with all those distractions.

908
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
We did this together like a team.

909
01:25:14,924 --> 01:25:16,924
Thanks Sully.

910
01:25:16,948 --> 01:25:18,948
We did our job.

911
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,500
Alright, we got to get this hearing back to order.

912
01:25:43,524 --> 01:25:45,524
Could you settle please?

913
01:25:46,248 --> 01:25:48,648
Take your seats.

914
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,200
That was honestly, the first time I was listening to a crash recording.

915
01:26:00,224 --> 01:26:08,424
While actually sitting with the Captain and First Officer.
It's extraordinary.

916
01:26:09,848 --> 01:26:11,848
That was no simulation?

917
01:26:12,672 --> 01:26:15,172
No it wasn't.

918
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,360
Gentlemen, I want to inform you that
the left engine was recovered.

919
01:26:22,384 --> 01:26:25,884
I'll just proceed to a comprehensive report.

920
01:26:26,808 --> 01:26:35,508
There was extensive damage to the fan blades of the engine,
5 compressor blades were fractured.

921
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,100
And 8 aerial veins missing.

922
01:26:40,056 --> 01:26:42,056
So no thrust.

923
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,880
As you testified, it was completely destroyed.

924
01:26:45,904 --> 01:26:47,904
The Aircraft's data was wrong.

925
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,180
I'd like to add something to a personal note:

926
01:26:56,204 --> 01:27:01,804
I can say with absolute confidence that, after speaking with the rest of the crew

927
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:07,828
bird experts, aviation engineers, after running into every scenario,

928
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:13,252
after running each player, there were still accidents results..

929
01:27:13,276 --> 01:27:21,876
And it's you, Captain Sullenberger, removing you from
the equation of math, just fails.

930
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,300
I disagree.

931
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:32,840
It wasn't just me, it was all of us.
Jeff, Donna, Shila and Dureene.

932
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:37,464
And all passengers, rescue workers.

933
01:27:37,488 --> 01:27:42,088
And Traffic Control, Helicopter Crews and Scuba Cops.

934
01:27:43,912 --> 01:27:45,812
We all did it!

935
01:27:46,336 --> 01:27:48,336
We survived.

936
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,900
First Officer Skiles, is there anything you'd like to add?

937
01:27:56,924 --> 01:28:02,924
Anything you would have done different, if you had to do it again?

938
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:07,448
Yes, I would have done it in July!

939
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:50,200
