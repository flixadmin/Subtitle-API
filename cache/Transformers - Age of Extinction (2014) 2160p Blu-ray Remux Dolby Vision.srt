1
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,949
Shit.
Darcy, you really shouldn't have come.

2
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,327
Show me.

3
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,419
Corporate was adamant.
We keep running.

4
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,338
No stopping operations.

5
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,507
No, no, no. You got to go through.
No cameras.

6
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,925
He's got orders to kill.

7
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,570
I don't even think
international laws apply up here.

8
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,637
We are geologists first.

9
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,515
If this thing
has any historical significance at all,

10
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,060
we are shutting down.
I'm shutting us down.

11
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,397
He's going to shoot me? Shoot me.

12
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,690
Hey, don't kill her.

13
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,443
This is crazy stuff.

14
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,995
Crazy shit.

15
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, what do you think?

16
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,006
I think history is about to change.

17
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,918
<i>I'm a nasty woman</i>

18
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,629
Look who decided to show up for work.

19
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,009
<i>I'm a heartbreaker</i>

20
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,679
<i>Gonna make you cry</i>

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,017
What, surf report no good
at South Padre?

22
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,688
The waves are flat and I got no gas.
You know that, Cade.

23
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,859
Dude. Rude.

24
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,320
Look at these two junebugs. My, my!

25
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,549
Hey, you're paying me on this one,
right, Cade?

26
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,842
Please tell me I'm getting paid.

27
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,386
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys
are just happy to have a job at all.

28
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,536
Yeah, I suppose.

29
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,055
- You got any cash on you?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,080
All right, good.

31
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,673
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

32
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,677
Place has been in the family since '28.

33
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,722
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

34
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,683
Real soon
he's going to sign it over to me.

35
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,394
The movies nowadays,
that's the trouble.

36
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,147
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

37
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,357
I love that one.

38
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,234
He's deaf and senile.

39
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,486
Heard that.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,821
Now these just need
some spit and polish.

41
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,741
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX.

42
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:24,992
Yeah, they're not.

43
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,387
Mister, we'll have a look around
if you want to leave us to it, okay?

44
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,246
You know, folks used to come
from miles around

45
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,583
to see the dancing girls
with the big cha-chas.

46
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,876
I swear to God

47
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,078
I am one diaper change away
from poisoning his oatmeal.

48
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,463
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

49
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,773
If coming here makes you feel young,

50
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,567
then you tell this kid
to bring you here every day.

51
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,259
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

52
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,385
Sold.

53
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,890
Remember this place
when we were kids?

54
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,601
How many girls you think
you brought here in high school?

55
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,523
I only remember one.

56
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,651
Hey, heads!

57
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,784
That's why you didn't make
the varsity team.

58
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,413
All right. Go long.

59
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,295
Leave it.

60
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,987
Mortar shells?

61
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,822
What the hell happened to you?

62
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,742
Hey, snakeballs.
How much for the truck?

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
Truck?

64
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,013
Two more weeks, girls,
till no more classes, ever.

65
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,849
Almost time to get a tan and get wasted!

66
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,713
Please, please.

67
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,428
No financial aid. Great.

68
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,436
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you.

69
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,189
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises!</i>

70
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,941
- Voice <i>recognition. It's me!
- I am dialing 911.</i>

71
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,944
Go right ahead. I don't care.

72
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,030
<i>I'm still calling 911.</i>

73
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,659
<i>The Battle of Chicago was an event
that permanently changed our world.</i>

74
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,982
<i>- Over 1,300 dead.
- Much of the city has been destroyed.</i>

75
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:18,123
<i>Homeland Security is urging everyone
to report suspicious alien activity.</i>

76
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,380
<i>A swift act of Congress
put an end to all joint operations</i>

77
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,384
<i>between the military and the Autobots,
ending the alliance.</i>

78
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,636
<i>As this committee knows,
the Invasion of Chicago</i>

79
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,138
<i>was a defining day
for our nation five years ago.</i>

80
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,141
The day millions of people realised that

81
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,478
never again can we allow aliens
to fight our battles for us.

82
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,691
A handful of Autobots
were given sanctuary

83
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,110
after joint-combat operations
were abolished.

84
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,279
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons
are still on the run

85
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,323
thanks to our CIA unit,

86
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,617
"Cemetery Wind."

87
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,345
<i>Hurry, let's get it to my house, guys.</i>

88
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,537
As for the alien technology,

89
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,700
our objective remains
to keep it in American control.

90
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,349
<i>Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.</i>

91
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>We found this alien ball turret
in Chicago.</i>

92
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,337
<i>We just found it in the rubble
and it's all working...</i>

93
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,131
Word has it Japan, India,

94
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,592
the Israelis may have gotten their hands
on a couple of ships.

95
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,634
Apparently the Russians
are starting a bidding war.

96
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,473
<i>We're taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

97
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,934
A new era has begun.

98
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,479
And the age of the Transformers is over.

99
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,043
Hey.

100
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,629
<i>Hey, I've been waiting for you.</i>

101
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,716
<i>You're looking hot today!</i>

102
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,802
Yeah?
How about you take your shirt off?

103
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,447
<i>You want me to take my shirt off
right now?</i>

104
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,698
<i>What would your dad think of that?</i>

105
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,116
- What the hell?
- Hey, where you <i>going?</i>

106
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,142
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

107
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,062
What the hell?

108
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,856
All the way!

109
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,528
A truck?

110
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,531
Dad, please tell me
you didn't spend our money on this.

111
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,217
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

112
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,521
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

113
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,203
As an advance
on your regular paycheck.

114
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,622
- What regular paycheck?
- Which you will get back.

115
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,165
- When?
- Never. We're broke.

116
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,416
I knew it.

117
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,376
Sweetheart, could you please not
drive a wedge

118
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,660
between employer and employee.

119
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,421
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

120
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,691
Look, I came up short, okay?
I had to buy her a prom dress.

121
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,195
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

122
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,778
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

123
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,720
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

124
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,598
Nobody wants to go to the dance
with their dad. It's weird.

125
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,891
It's not the issue.

126
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,518
Well, maybe it should be.

127
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,037
Hey, could you guys
just get off my case?

128
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,701
You know what the engine
on this runs for?

129
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,165
I can break it down and strip it for parts.

130
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,150
And sweetheart, your shorts
are shrinking by the second, okay?

131
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,735
Cold water, air dry, please.

132
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,364
I think she looks hot.

133
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:56,824
What did you say?

134
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,534
Like a hot teenager.

135
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,245
It's the "teenager" thing
that makes it better. Thank you.

136
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,728
It didn't sound like what it meant.

137
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,697
That goes by the circuit boards.

138
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,130
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

139
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,759
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

140
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,594
just so you can turn it into different junk.

141
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,429
We do not use the "J" word in here.

142
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,224
That is a Super Simplex
theatre projector. It's very rare.

143
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,184
What about the SmilePilot?

144
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,104
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

145
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,731
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

146
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,396
You're gonna get him upset.

147
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,279
Hey, Cade! Cade!

148
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,947
This thing still work?

149
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,282
- No!
- Yes.

150
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,565
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

151
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,619
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

152
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,500
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

153
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,795
Final notice, late notice, past due.

154
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,298
Come on, come on.

155
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,134
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.

156
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,887
I mean, what is all this crap
people send you?

157
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,857
That's a Discman
and that's an 8-track tape.

158
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,725
- Music.
- Never heard of it.

159
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,562
Look, I fix that,
it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.

160
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,124
If I would have been able to fix that
before you broke it even more,

161
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,208
it would have been 20 bucks.

162
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,710
This stuff is what's
gonna put you through college,

163
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,652
as long as you land
one of those scholarships.

164
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,488
What's the estimated time of arrival,
usually? Average?

165
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,660
Wait. So it just brings
the beer near you?

166
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,870
That's the trick?

167
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,289
- It's got a couple kinks, man.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,125
Dad, you think maybe some things
should never be invented?

169
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,728
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.

170
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,513
This is a temple of technology.
You guys are standing in a holy place.

171
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,258
What do you think?
Why don't you look at all of this?

172
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,302
This could be yours.
What about this land?

173
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,263
Purple People Eater's back
and she looks hungry.

174
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,015
Isn't this incredible?

175
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,785
- I knew you would like it.
- Hey, you!

176
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,060
Hey.

177
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,520
I own this house! It's not for sale!

178
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,940
Six months late on payments,
Mr Yeager.

179
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,192
And I see you stealing power
at the pole.

180
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,568
Hey, that's not your concern.

181
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,695
- Sir, do you wanna see the property?
- Sure.

182
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,405
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

183
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,050
I'll show you three other buyers
I got buried out back,

184
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,593
then I'll crack your head open
like an egg!

185
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,035
Stay back! He's crazy.

186
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,554
I told you don't come back here
any more.

187
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,931
I will have my brother come back
and beat your ass!

188
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,557
- Don't you start with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

189
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,934
And I'll bring the police
when I come, too!

190
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,168
- My brother ain't no joke!
- Who, Jerry?

191
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,604
You bring his big ass up here,

192
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,357
he's gonna be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car!

193
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,621
You back out on my grass,
you're gonna be in big trouble!

194
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,136
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I'll give him some pecan pie.

195
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,639
Hey!

196
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,019
She smashed through the fence?

197
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,064
Cade, relax.
You're going to have an aortic infarction.

198
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,232
What is that?

199
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,900
I think it's a brain heart attack.

200
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,276
Yeah, I've had one already.

201
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,736
So we're stealing power now?

202
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,381
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbours.

203
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,490
Great. That's awesome.

204
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,410
Once I graduate and I'm gone,
who's gonna take care of you?

205
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,744
You take care of me?

206
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,972
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?

207
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,422
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

208
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,334
Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do.

209
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,229
Who taught you how to cook
without ketchup,

210
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,879
or balance your chequebook?

211
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,676
Who always has to be the grownup
around here?

212
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,097
All right, you got a point, okay?
But that means we're a great team.

213
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,766
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

214
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,769
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie.
You just gotta keep believing, okay?

215
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,247
I mean, that's what great inventors do.

216
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,233
I promise you, one day,
I'm gonna build something that matters.

217
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,695
I believe you, Dad.

218
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,657
You know, your mom
would be very proud of you.

219
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,119
It's going to be okay.

220
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,277
Spread out! Push right!

221
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,528
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

222
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,113
Give me two. Give me two.

223
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,157
Take the beach, nice and easy.

224
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,160
<i>All right, hold what you got.</i>

225
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,622
Release the mini-drones.

226
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,100
<i>Vipers. Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.</i>

227
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,688
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

228
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,149
<i>Predator 0-1. Captured target area.</i>

229
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,901
<i>Set charges.</i>

230
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,701
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

231
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,706
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

232
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,063
Breached site on rooftop.

233
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,566
- Breached site on rooftop.
- Have Echo Platoon on standby.

234
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,235
Let the helo know
we're moving external!

235
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,907
<i>Alpha, take port. Bravo, take starboard.</i>

236
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,909
<i>Shift right. Shift right.</i>

237
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,167
Cracking steel!

238
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,464
No!

239
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,633
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

240
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,846
Fire.

241
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>Missiles out. Danger close.</i>

242
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,811
He's running! Move!

243
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,771
<i>He's on the run! He's on the run!</i>

244
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,787
No! Please!

245
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,790
Hold your fire.

246
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,212
Hold! Hold fire!

247
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,506
Can you not see? I've been injured.

248
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,967
<i>Box him in. Box him in.</i>

249
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,554
Medical Officer Ratchet! I'm a friend!

250
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm an Autobot!

251
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,436
Then why are you running?

252
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,439
Optimus sent this distress message.

253
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

254
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,237
<i>We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.</i>

255
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,950
We're all hiding.
All Autobots are being hunted.

256
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,159
We're all in danger.

257
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,495
I lost a sister in Chicago.

258
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,664
You'll get no sympathy from me.

259
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,513
What's wrong with you humans?

260
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,106
No! Please.

261
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,529
Check fire, check fire!

262
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,458
He's mine now.

263
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,795
Lockdown.

264
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,631
Autobots, Decepticons.

265
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,136
Like little children, always fighting.

266
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,055
Making a mess out of the universe.

267
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,725
Then I've got to clean it up.

268
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,269
There is one way you survive.

269
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,229
Tell me where he's hiding.

270
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,566
Where is Optimus Prime?

271
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,360
Never.

272
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,496
Never is here.

273
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,673
I must say, it is remarkable,

274
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,259
really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

275
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,219
since you have taken
operational control,

276
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,264
and so the President
has asked me to ask you

277
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,183
to ask him,

278
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,143
to invite you both

279
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,395
over to the White House
just to powwow,

280
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:52,442
where we get maybe
some more specifics about how

281
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,987
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

282
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,406
I've had my desk for two years.

283
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,784
Mr Attinger has been here for 25.

284
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,454
He runs the projects
where I don't ask for specifics.

285
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,206
That's why they're called Black Ops.

286
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,792
And why we all sleep better at night.

287
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,127
Check. That is great. So...

288
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,258
Any dirt on that? How that's going?

289
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,595
Outstanding.

290
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,013
Great. Great.

291
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,949
I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

292
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:28,395
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only
been Chief of Staff since Monday,

293
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,856
but I do know that
the alien war stuff, these are...

294
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,691
These are the only fun meetings.

295
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,319
Look, I'm not here
to entertain the President,

296
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,031
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

297
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,783
Soon.

298
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,829
"...be over..." In case he asks,
I just like to have an exact quote.

299
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,623
"War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.

300
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:53,002
And the President would,
I know, just love...

301
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,255
Really, really love to press the flesh...

302
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,008
Not flesh, obviously,
but just maybe get a shot with...

303
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,343
ls it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

304
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,429
We could bop on Air Force One.

305
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,490
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and bop back.

306
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,474
- I wouldn't get his hopes up on that one.
- Okay.

307
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,226
He's called Optimus Prime.

308
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,521
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

309
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,192
But aren't they our friends? Why?

310
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,404
Because our world
will never truly be safe

311
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,613
till all of them are gone.

312
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,535
Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

313
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:29,080
Especially since our military
has worked so closely with them.

314
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,082
- Until you.
- It's not their planet.

315
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,959
Never was.

316
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,213
Time we take it back.

317
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,101
All right, come on. Come on.

318
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,480
Yes. Yes.

319
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,106
Yes.

320
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,275
There you go.

321
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,068
No, hold it.

322
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,197
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking?

323
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,281
You have the job!

324
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,700
You forgot to eat dinner!

325
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,079
You see why I worry?

326
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,792
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

327
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,295
I almost got it working right.

328
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,299
So, listen, I'm done with homework
and set with finals,

329
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,927
so I was just gonna take a little drive
with some friends

330
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,386
if that was okay with you.

331
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,307
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

332
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,767
Exactly.

333
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,937
You do know
no one else has this rule, right?

334
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,148
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay.
It's wisdom.

335
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,752
I don't think we need to be
driving around in the middle of the night.

336
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,861
It's already like quarter to eight.
It's almost dark.

337
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,530
Spud, will you stop it?

338
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,407
You know where I was
for my graduation?

339
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,826
Yes. With me, the mistake.

340
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,788
The surprise, Tess.
And the best thing that ever happened.

341
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,792
Do we look unhappy?
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

342
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,128
I made your mother a promise
before she passed.

343
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,923
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation.
That's it.

344
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,677
High school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.

345
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,388
So if you were older and wiser,
I wouldn't exist.

346
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,057
That's not what I meant.

347
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,952
You know, this is
a non-dating household, okay?

348
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,602
You don't date, I don't date. That's it.

349
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,854
Well, maybe you should.

350
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,566
Tessa, wait.

351
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,734
Tessa?

352
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,445
Look.

353
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,657
I know I've been on you, okay?
But I have to be.

354
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,202
Twelve to seventeen
is the official teenage danger window.

355
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:35,498
It's my job to get you through it.
So you can be pissed off all you want.

356
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,839
And, yes, you can take a ride
with your friends.

357
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,257
Okay.

358
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,092
Don't work all night.

359
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,677
And eat.

360
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,072
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

361
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,034
She's the best thing that ever happened.

362
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,202
You'd be proud.

363
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,209
No.

364
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,219
Unbelievable.

365
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,223
Unbelievable. God!

366
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,730
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

367
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,903
Come on, you old wreck.

368
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,738
Judgement Day.

369
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,252
Where is he?

370
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,879
I don't know.

371
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,217
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

372
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,385
Asshole.

373
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,096
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

374
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,600
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.
Su <i>casa es mi casa.</i>

375
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,602
And we're going to lose the <i>casa.</i>

376
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,104
Dad!

377
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,689
Coming!

378
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,943
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I'm not coming in.

379
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,504
You guys have never seen
a truck like this before.

380
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,029
Get in here. Lock that door.

381
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,948
It doesn't have a lock.

382
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,761
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

383
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,202
Something blew a hole in it!

384
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,412
Yeah, so?

385
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,788
It's not normal steel.

386
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,350
The shrapnel in the engine,
it ripped all the connections apart.

387
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,001
And watch.
And this took some Cade genius.

388
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,920
You are gonna love this.

389
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,631
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

390
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,469
<i>Calling all...</i>

391
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,972
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

392
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,140
Yeah.

393
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,434
I don't think it's a truck at all.

394
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,561
I think we just found a Transformer.

395
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,895
Tran...

396
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,356
- Evacuate!
- Wait! Guys!

397
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,877
Dad, are you out of your mind?
You need to get that thing out of here.

398
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,130
You don't have to worry. I've been
in there working all night. I'm fine.

399
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,673
You know what?
That's not a truck, okay? You're right.

400
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,323
It's an alien killing machine.

401
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,658
- Dude. It's DOA.
- Jesus.

402
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,225
It's been recalled, totalled, done.

403
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,929
So, listen,
there's a number that you call.

404
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,331
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.

405
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,375
- Here we go.
- You're supposed to call,

406
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,793
and if it ends up being alien,

407
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,211
then you win $25,000.

408
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,504
You don't win money.

409
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,815
And if you can capture it live...

410
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,842
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,
then you get $100,000.

411
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,486
- Dad, we're making the call.
- I heard that.

412
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,947
I've seen the commercial. They don't
say that. That's not a guarantee.

413
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,306
You think Greg would lie to me?

414
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,576
Look, if that's a Transformer there
from the Battle of Chicago,

415
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,143
I need to know how it works.

416
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,854
I'm an inventor.
This could be a game changer for me!

417
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,817
If I can apply that technology
to my inventions,

418
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,500
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

419
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,984
I've heard that before.

420
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,500
Twenty-five grand!
It pays for my college.

421
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,571
It pays for the house.

422
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,841
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

423
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,785
So technically, that's my truck.
Don't you think?

424
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,789
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab l.P.

425
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,208
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

426
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,046
You signed it and now you're competing.

427
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,090
Any idea of yours is mine.
Any thought you have, I own it,

428
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,884
so basically, I own you.

429
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,220
I don't think you can own someone.

430
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,514
That was, like, a while ago,
even in Texas.

431
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,309
All right. Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

432
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,104
I think the shrapnel
took out its power core.

433
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,357
And, Tessa, you see this?

434
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,487
Would an alien killing machine
let me do that?

435
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,947
Look, I'll make the call.

436
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,282
We'll get the money.
Just first let me see if I'm right.

437
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,134
You want to hide in the house?
Go ahead.

438
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,160
Okay.

439
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,204
Let's go. Pulley arm.

440
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,917
I can't believe him!

441
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,379
What is that? Looks like a missile.

442
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,839
It is!

443
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,312
Dad!

444
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,357
There's a missile in the family room!

445
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,609
Holy...

446
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,115
I'll kill you!

447
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,746
No! No!

448
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,000
Dad, there's a missile in...

449
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,965
I'll kill you! Stay back!

450
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,051
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
- Call 911! Run!

451
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,512
- Lucas!
- Stop!

452
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,310
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

453
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,648
Easy, human.

454
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,359
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.

455
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,071
Weapons systems damaged.

456
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,448
A missile hit your engine.

457
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:04,493
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.

458
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,872
I'm just trying to help you.

459
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,391
You're in my home now.
I'm an engineer.

460
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,042
My name is Cade Yeager.

461
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:14,712
Cade, I am in your debt.

462
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,633
My name is Optimus Prime.

463
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,302
My Autobots.

464
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,638
They're in danger.

465
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,102
I need to go. I need to go now.

466
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,521
How far you think you're gonna get?

467
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,900
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

468
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,986
What happened to you?

469
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,491
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

470
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,247
I escaped and took this form.

471
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,791
But you're on our side.

472
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,043
Why would humans hurt you?

473
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,463
They were not alone.

474
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,801
- My Autobots can repair me.
- Yeah.

475
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:04,762
If you can reach 'em.

476
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,728
What about me?

477
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,086
I warn you, Mr Attinger of Earth,

478
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,090
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,

479
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,467
like humans,

480
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,594
expire.

481
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,556
On this planet, we have a saying.

482
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,808
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

483
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,227
I also have a saying.

484
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,354
"L don't care."

485
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,733
So what happened in Mexico City?

486
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,067
I thought you had him.

487
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:04,780
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.

488
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,825
You promised me human intelligence.

489
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,619
Or is there such a thing?

490
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,164
You know, you've still never told me.

491
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,374
Why do you want him?

492
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,334
Who are you working for?

493
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:22,298
Every galaxy I've traveled,
all you species are the same.

494
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,843
You all think
you're the centre of the universe.

495
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,513
You have no idea.

496
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,118
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

497
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,143
The whole list.

498
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,287
What, you're going to try and fix him?

499
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,645
He's not a model train set, Cade.

500
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,147
No, that's right. He's important.

501
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,356
Yeah, but important to who?

502
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,358
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

503
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,627
What are you gonna do, play with him?

504
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,004
- Will you calm down?
- I'm trying to,

505
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,447
but I just got hit in the head
with a ten-foot cannon!

506
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,115
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

507
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,950
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

508
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,993
Not a single word.

509
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,453
<i>Nobody.</i>

510
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,509
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

511
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,339
Special Operations group is ready.

512
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,840
What do you got?

513
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,510
Sir, Special Ops just got a call
from Paris, Texas.

514
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,012
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

515
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,431
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

516
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,021
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

517
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,107
The missile just missed
your power source.

518
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,984
We call it a Spark.

519
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,322
It contains our life force
and our memories.

520
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,407
Yeah, we call it a soul.

521
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,495
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

522
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,849
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

523
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,291
This room is going dark.

524
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,794
The exit is on your left.

525
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,213
<i>- I'll</i> take it from here.
- Okay, let's go.

526
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,217
I'm with Cemetery Wind.
We're on the move.

527
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>Repeat, on the move.</i>

528
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,939
Cade.

529
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,067
Why are you willing to help me?

530
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,362
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

531
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,505
I'm back!

532
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,090
Took you long enough!

533
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,064
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor.

534
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,760
I got a welt on my head

535
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,263
that makes me look
like a fricking Star Trek character.

536
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,347
Whatever.

537
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,193
Look! Look!

538
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,461
<i>- We're on property.
- Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.</i>

539
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,768
Dad!

540
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,521
Mr Yeager, my name's James Savoy.
I'm a federal agent.

541
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,275
My men and I are trying to track down
an abandoned truck.

542
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:17,157
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.

543
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,701
Well, thanks. She's not.

544
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,954
That the truck you mean?

545
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,498
Afraid not.

546
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,560
You know, Mr Yeager,
we received a call from someone

547
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,128
concerned about this truck.

548
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,212
No.

549
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:31,672
That wasn't you?

550
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,651
Only thing I'm concerned about
is you being on my property

551
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,884
without permission.

552
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,013
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

553
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,865
And I don't know what truck
you're talking about.

554
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,933
The kind that cost American lives.

555
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,518
Search the property!

556
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:45,870
What do you mean,
"Search the property"?

557
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,895
You don't have a warrant.

558
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,106
My face is my warrant.

559
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,444
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck,
we get a reward, right?

560
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,904
<i>Viper 15 holding, point alpha.</i>

561
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,619
<i>Charlie team, hold tight.</i>

562
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,496
<i>Lock it down.</i>

563
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,374
- Open, open, open.
- Short wall. Short wall.

564
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,959
Five in. Five in.

565
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,670
<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises.</i>

566
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,754
- What the hell is that?
- Just some dumb inventor.

567
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:14,923
Clear.

568
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:15,966
Clear.

569
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,926
Clear right.

570
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,428
Clear.

571
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,014
360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

572
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,776
Let's go. There's nothing here.

573
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,449
There's no signs. We got nothing.

574
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,951
Sir, we have a live armed missile
in the trash.

575
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:47,706
Live? I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.

576
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,376
I could be dead. Right?

577
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,295
Look.
Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.

578
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,912
I towed it back for the parts.

579
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,858
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

580
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,276
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

581
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,700
That's as much as I know about him.

582
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,136
"Him."

583
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,098
He said, "Him."

584
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,457
<i>He knows who the son of a bitch is.</i>

585
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,479
- Mr Yeager.
- What?

586
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,688
Excuse me.

587
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,650
You just said, "Him."

588
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,736
- Take them down.
- What?

589
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,322
Let me go!

590
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,908
They don't know about the truck! I know!
Just let her go.

591
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:27,830
What kind of a man betrays his flesh-
and-blood brethren for alien metal?

592
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,182
- Get this guy out of my sight.
- Get off!

593
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,926
Let her go!
They don't know about the truck.

594
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,602
All right! Load up! Search the perimeter!

595
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,378
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

596
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,005
No!
I don't know any of these scary guys.

597
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,633
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman!
I'll kick your ass!

598
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,343
Let her go!

599
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,388
- Daddy! Let me go!
- You're not going anywhere.

600
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,306
Daddy!

601
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,875
No! You're not taking me anywhere!

602
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:49,852
I'm an American!

603
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,330
- Easy, sweetheart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

604
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,523
All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong.

605
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,776
Savoy. Use the girl.

606
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,445
Oh, my God!

607
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,036
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

608
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,251
- You're gonna shoot my little girl?
- If I have to.

609
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,562
Please don't shoot me! Please!

610
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,981
Look, I don't know. I told you
everything that I know! He's gone.

611
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,725
He left.
He was in the barn, I swear to God!

612
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,550
<i>Just let her go!</i>

613
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,218
Please, please.

614
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,345
He was in there! Let her go!

615
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,680
Seven seconds.

616
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,892
I'm telling you the truth!
He was in there!

617
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,353
Dad!

618
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,064
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

619
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,650
Dad!

620
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,890
You touch her and I'll kill you!

621
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,072
You got two seconds.

622
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,824
I need the truth.

623
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,951
- Please.
- Shoot her.

624
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,593
Here I am!

625
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,516
Get down!

626
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,062
Cade! They're going to kill you!
Get out of here!

627
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,077
Push right! Headed to the house!

628
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,366
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car!

629
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,991
- Let's go!
- Daddy, get in the car!

630
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,687
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!

631
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,435
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

632
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,461
It's the truck. They want the truck!

633
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,364
"Who are they"? Who are you,
and who are you calling "baby"?

634
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,216
I know you heard me.

635
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,900
- I'm her boyfriend!
- He's my boyfriend!

636
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,470
What?
You're not her boyfriend!

637
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,973
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.

638
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,230
What kind of cars are those?
They're so scary!

639
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,671
There's another one
coming up the back!

640
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,157
You gotta try to lose them
in the cornfield!

641
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,508
He's coming up behind us! Go!

642
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,100
<i>Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.</i>

643
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,859
They've got us cornered!

644
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,363
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

645
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,160
Mr Yeager, this is not
how I wanted us to meet, okay?

646
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,667
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely...

647
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,627
And I am not talking to you!
Drive the car!

648
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,296
Watch out! Watch out!

649
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,308
<i>Throw 'em some warning shots!</i>

650
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,541
Man, I don't know how
I'm driving this good.

651
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,525
It's like, today
I've gone to a whole other level.

652
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,777
Road, focus! Stop talking!

653
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,447
Shane, look out!

654
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,956
This may be primarily my fault, okay.

655
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,433
They said
they were gonna bring a cheque!

656
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,377
I didn't know they were gonna send
a death squad!

657
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,053
Hang on!

658
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,324
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!
Don's got it over here.

659
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,349
Look out!

660
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,525
We lost them!
Good job, stranger from the cornfields!

661
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,994
The scary cars are back.

662
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,664
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

663
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,644
I thought you knew
how to drive this thing! Go!

664
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,354
I don't think we're gonna get that money.
Doesn't seem like it.

665
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:36,907
Cade!

666
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,085
Take 'em upstairs!

667
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,278
We're losing them on the fifth floor.

668
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,327
- Do that thing, Shane!
- You know it.

669
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,642
What do you mean? What thing?

670
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,645
What we're about to do
is gonna be kind of scary.

671
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,856
Take out your guns and shoot them!

672
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,027
They're shooting at us!

673
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,994
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!
- What?

674
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,671
She's got
the best hands in the business.

675
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,409
Ready, Tess? Pull!

676
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,583
- No! No! No!
- No f-ing way!

677
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,052
Yeah!

678
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:42,848
Yeah!

679
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,267
Tessa, you are so grounded!

680
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,102
Shit! The rim's cracked.

681
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,857
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!

682
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,110
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

683
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,153
- Lucas!
- Wait! Wait!

684
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:00,365
Lucas! Lucas, above you!

685
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,117
Run!

686
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,145
Come on, get in, let's go!

687
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:36,151
<i>I'll bet you wish
you could see my face right now.</i>

688
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,533
Lucas, we just left him?

689
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:27,953
He's gone.

690
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,933
My deepest sympathies
for the loss of your friend.

691
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:53,728
Stay here till I'm sure
we weren't followed.

692
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,731
We are all targets now.

693
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,658
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

694
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,410
We're taking orders from a truck?

695
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,412
Well, you got a better idea?

696
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,083
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...

697
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,544
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.

698
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,589
You got your ass kicked
by a garage inventor from Texas.

699
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,425
That goes on your resume.

700
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,635
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!

701
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,680
Do I look like I'm in the mood
for any of your shit today?

702
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,267
Washington thinks
we were chasing a Decepticon target,

703
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,311
but our story falls apart
if we don't find this Yeager family first.

704
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,106
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

705
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,357
They know to hand him over.

706
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,444
His world as he knows it is gone.

707
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,369
Well, bright side, you guys met.

708
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,622
Where is he from?

709
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,499
I told you, he's a driver from Texas.

710
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,625
Texas?

711
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,378
Where, Dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

712
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:01,982
So why does he sound
like a leprechaun?

713
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,466
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland
for saying that.

714
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,789
Well, we're not in Ireland,
Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.

715
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,155
And so he drives?
What do you mean, he drives?

716
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,180
Like, for a living?

717
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:13,266
Yeah. At least he makes a living.

718
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,060
Thank you.

719
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,978
Look, I race rally cars.

720
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:18,063
One driver.

721
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,815
One navigator. Her.

722
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,099
By the way, I'm totally legit.

723
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,819
L just got picked up by Red Bull.

724
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,988
And just so you know,

725
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,991
my life savings
was in that car back there.

726
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,660
- This is not happening.
- It definitely is.

727
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,795
How old are you?

728
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,463
Twenty.

729
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,507
She's a 17-year-old girl.

730
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,675
So we can work this two ways.

731
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,762
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

732
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:51,846
- Dad.
- Or two,

733
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,654
I just call the cops on you
because this is illegal. She's a minor.

734
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,527
We're protected by
the Romeo and Juliet laws.

735
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:58,978
We dated for a little while.

736
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,664
I was a sophomore,
and he was a senior. It's fine.

737
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,940
No, it's not fine.

738
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,110
We've got a preexisting
juvenile foundational relationship.

739
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,446
- Statute 22.011.
- What?

740
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,740
Texas statute?

741
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,075
- That a real law?
- Yep.

742
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,744
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

743
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,207
- You know how those two ended up?
- In love.

744
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,918
Dead. Do your parents know about this?

745
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,754
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

746
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,174
He took off when I was five,
but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

747
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,426
You know, Tessa,

748
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,971
- I trusted you.
- To what?

749
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:37,225
Never have fun, take a risk,
be a normal teenager, like you?

750
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:38,434
I am your father, okay?

751
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,728
And I have been busting my ass
to take care of you.

752
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,606
Is that what you were doing
when you brought home the truck?

753
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:47,318
All you had to do was report it,
and now Lucas is dead.

754
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,946
And my life is over. Thank you.

755
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,739
You've taken real good care of me.

756
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,336
<i>Please don't shoot me!</i>

757
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,880
Please! Dad!

758
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,883
They were willing to kill her.

759
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,302
Then they still are.

760
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,103
Somebody somewhere gave that order.
I'm going to find some fingerprints.

761
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,146
<i>Please!</i>

762
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,774
<i>No!</i>

763
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,028
<i>I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!</i>

764
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,339
<i>Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.</i>

765
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,490
Clothes, anything.
And take that computer.

766
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,287
Let's go.

767
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,754
This is not easy.

768
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,131
You know,
you don't suck at everything, Dad.

769
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:55,428
What the...

770
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,815
I knew it.

771
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,112
You told me he was no one.

772
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:15,823
Well,

773
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,285
this "no one" has our tech.

774
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,645
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

775
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,356
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

776
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,659
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

777
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,642
That was insane!

778
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,326
It was awesome,
but it was insane, right?

779
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,575
Yeah! Hell, yeah!

780
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,953
He's back! He's alive!

781
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:46,956
Optimus is here!

782
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,260
At last. There is hope after all.

783
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,907
Yeah.

784
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:24,452
Mr Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.

785
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,955
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.

786
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,958
We got your warning.
We've been waiting.

787
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:35,588
Hell, yeah. Boom time.
We got the gang back together.

788
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:57,860
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

789
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:01,989
Well, the rules have just changed.

790
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,660
Human beings,
bunch of backstabbin' weasels.

791
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,995
Hound, find your inner compass.

792
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:12,250
Loyalty is but a flower
in the winds of fear and temptation.

793
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,001
What the hell are you saying?

794
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,503
- It's a haiku.
- Cut the crap,

795
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,380
before I drop a grenade
down your throat.

796
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,840
Try it, you'll be dead.

797
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,550
Please pull it. Please do it.

798
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,261
<i>You know what,
it'll save us so much time.</i>

799
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,012
Well, raise your hand

800
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:29,434
if you're thoroughly disenchanted
with our little pleasant Earth vacation.

801
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,018
So, who's the stowaways?

802
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,895
Hey, what's with the gun?

803
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,605
Stop. Hound, both of you.

804
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,066
They've risked their lives for mine.

805
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,402
<i>We owe them.</i>

806
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,239
<i>So, there's been no sign of any others?</i>

807
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,700
- Nada.
- We are all that's left.

808
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,910
They're picking us off, one by one.

809
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:51,789
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.
And you make five.

810
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,418
So that's our best-case scenario?

811
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,962
Autobot witness protection?

812
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,632
Hey, Speed Racer,
you're welcome to leave anytime.

813
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,218
Well, for the record, Superdad,

814
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,805
I'm not hiding with you.
I'm hiding outwith that big guy.

815
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,766
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

816
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,768
Bumblebee has held command,

817
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,521
despite his complete
and total lack of anything

818
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,316
resembling warrior discipline.

819
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,442
He's like a child.

820
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,068
<i>This child is about to kick your ass.</i>

821
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:22,695
He brings us shame.

822
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,324
Cage fight.

823
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,575
Smartass.

824
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:28,951
What's the matter with them?

825
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,581
Am I the lone sage who sees through

826
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,417
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

827
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:39,337
Yes, I've been waiting
for them all to dispatch each other,

828
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,506
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

829
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,049
Just me reporting to me.

830
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,110
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

831
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:48,471
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us

832
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,098
and humans are helping.

833
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,518
We need to know why.

834
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,562
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

835
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,860
This drone I stole recorded footage
of an Autobot raid.

836
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,031
It's in pieces,
but watch what happens here.

837
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,117
That's Leadfoot.

838
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:11,702
They rip him apart.

839
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,162
Savages.

840
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,498
And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

841
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,916
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

842
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,293
Defence, aerospace,
government contracts.

843
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,254
They designed this drone.

844
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,065
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

845
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,757
and then pass you off to this KSI?

846
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,426
The company is headquartered
in Chicago.

847
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,136
That could be where they were taken.

848
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,138
No way to get inside without a battle.

849
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,975
Well, what if you had
some human help?

850
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,495
- What, are you two partners now?
- Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

851
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,980
We need to know why
or we'll never get our lives back.

852
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,106
Autobots,

853
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,109
I have sworn to never kill humans.

854
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,402
Big mistake.

855
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,654
But when I find out who's behind this,

856
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,949
he's going to die.

857
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,676
<i>There's a full-on manhunt out for us,
so we have some new rules.</i>

858
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,845
<i>Anyone who has got a badge
is not our friend.</i>

859
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,847
<i>We're gonna divide and conquer.</i>

860
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,058
<i>You two in charge of stealing food
and the essentials. And nothing else.</i>

861
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,109
<i>Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

862
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,337
<i>I'm gonna find a way
into their top-secret military wing.</i>

863
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,989
<i>Find something to blackmail
this company and the government.</i>

864
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:31,907
<i>We're gonna get our freedom back.</i>

865
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,793
Good morning, Mr Joyce.

866
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:49,925
What was that sound?

867
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,219
That's "the" sound.

868
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,888
That you asked for.

869
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,476
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

870
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,037
When you walk through a door
in this building,

871
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,480
it should sound like
you've stepped into the future.

872
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,820
Present.

873
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,242
Say it.

874
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,577
Future.

875
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,748
<i>The past is history. The present is past.</i>

876
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,792
<i>The future is now.</i>

877
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,919
Why can't I get in touch with you?

878
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,923
Don't you realise
what the Arctic find means?

879
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,593
You know that story
we were all told as children

880
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,970
about a giant asteroid
that struck the Earth

881
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,431
millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?

882
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,725
- Vaguely.
- We were wrong.

883
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,728
This metal caused the great extinction.

884
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:44,313
How and why, I can't yet say.

885
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,983
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

886
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:51,779
This ore you've got us digging for
is a lot more dangerous than you think.

887
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:52,947
And my people...

888
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:57,076
Darcy, I think that you've been
out in the field for far too long.

889
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,121
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs
over dinner?

890
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,665
- Ribs?
- Not a chance.

891
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,210
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

892
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,171
We're about to make the quantum leap.

893
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,133
A rare-earth metal.

894
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:14,844
Molecularly unstable.

895
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,847
Industrial uses, none.

896
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,558
And then the aliens came.

897
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,351
And we made the connection.

898
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,187
It's what they're made of.

899
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:26,856
<i>It's the Holy Grail.</i>

900
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:30,151
"Transformium."
That's what we're calling it.

901
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,652
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

902
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:32,903
- Trademarked.
- Yeah.

903
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,490
This is the greatest advance
in modern physics

904
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:37,992
since the splitting of the atom.

905
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,494
It's programmable matter.

906
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,148
And now, we've mapped its genome.

907
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,665
- L.
- Now you've mapped its genome.

908
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,003
And now we can begin to give it

909
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,755
instructions.

910
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,220
This is extremely good.

911
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,681
Watch this.

912
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:12,026
We can change anything into anything.

913
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,782
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

914
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,705
Do you like music?

915
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:26,832
The Pill.

916
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,670
Perhaps something a little more violent?

917
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,552
Oh, my God. You've done it.

918
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:41,472
In aerospace, the military...

919
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,517
We will own the entire robotics industry.

920
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,185
All exploration.

921
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:49,104
The oceans. Space. Everything.

922
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,775
Wembley. What is this?

923
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,402
The jellyfish commercial
that you wanted.

924
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,655
You said they were erotic yet deadly,
like women.

925
01:00:57,822 --> 01:00:59,198
I never said that.

926
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,700
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

927
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:02,803
I definitely heard you say it

928
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:04,054
'cause you were talking
about your ex-girlfriend,

929
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,788
who was sexy, but a bitch.

930
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,873
Please don't eat on the tour.

931
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,917
Is that her?

932
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,882
Hey, I found a whole bunch
of boxes of clothes.

933
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,194
So, sweetie, you can get some
long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

934
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:21,298
and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?

935
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:25,933
It's protein.

936
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,935
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

937
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,396
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.

938
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:31,897
You stole mouthwash?

939
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,220
I like to be fresh
when I'm making out with your daughter.

940
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:36,902
That's funny.

941
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,199
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

942
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,869
Ever?

943
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,122
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

944
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,833
I don't understand it.

945
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,419
This is the fifth iteration.

946
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,020
Why does he keep turning out like this?

947
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,631
It's just some bugs in the final render.

948
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:01,844
I modelled Galvatron
after Optimus Prime.

949
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,263
Why does he keep looking
like Megatron?

950
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,974
<i>Rendering sequence is almost finished.
Stand by.</i>

951
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,684
Simple coding.

952
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,771
Algorithms!

953
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,024
Math!

954
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:18,444
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

955
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,446
the way we want to make it?

956
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,115
<i>Why'?</i>

957
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,871
And does that look
like a consumer-friendly face to you?

958
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:33,250
And what about that
big hole in the chest?

959
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:35,294
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

960
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,880
- Love it
- Well, I hate it.

961
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,508
Here he is.

962
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,053
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

963
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:47,932
Ma'am, this is not legal.
This is illegal experimentation.

964
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,017
Aliens would never do this to people!

965
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,700
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.

966
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,104
This ain't right!
Nobody puts baby in a box!

967
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,026
This is worse than waterboarding!

968
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:01,028
This little gentleman
has been translating for us

969
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:03,572
all the information
that comes from these two heads.

970
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:06,533
Their history, their science, everything.

971
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,994
- Is that Megatron?
- Precisely.

972
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,871
Where did you get all this?

973
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,581
Special government contract.

974
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,513
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

975
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,378
And now at long last
we can build them ourselves.

976
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,338
And we can build them better.

977
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,237
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in.

978
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:50,011
<i>A couple times a day,
these guys are moving</i>

979
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,788
<i>in vehicle shipments into KSI
for something called "scanning."</i>

980
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,707
Major security all over.

981
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:58,252
So our best shot at getting in
is a back classified research entrance.

982
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,462
<i>I'm gonna drive in with Bee
tomorrow morning.</i>

983
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:06,301
Excuse me.

984
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,095
There's no smooching
in front of me, okay?

985
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:11,015
You're so square.
Who even says "smooching"?

986
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,891
I tell you, no respect.

987
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,601
It's just impossible sometimes.

988
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:17,604
Yeah. I went through that
with Bumblebee.

989
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,489
Calm down. Calm down.

990
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,676
You know, at a time like this,

991
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,661
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

992
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:35,789
About a month ago,

993
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,084
middle of the night,
I thought I heard noises in my house.

994
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,461
Was that you?

995
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,545
What? Come on. No way.

996
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,629
Don't lie to me, kid.

997
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:44,772
You see that guy with the gun out there?

998
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,942
There's so many guys with guns.

999
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:47,027
Let's get out of the car and tell him

1000
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:48,361
we're about to break in
and it's your idea,

1001
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,655
'cause I don't care.
I'm old, I've already lived long enough.

1002
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:51,759
You have a really bad habit

1003
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,575
of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

1004
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,851
You want to come clean
or you want me to make a mess?

1005
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,662
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

1006
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,366
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

1007
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,691
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1008
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,319
Taking it in for scanning?

1009
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,449
All right. You're good to go.

1010
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,159
I'm literally gonna kill you.

1011
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,162
<i>Scanning in bay three.</i>

1012
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,498
<i>We took old, alien technology</i>

1013
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,459
<i>and made it better in every way.</i>

1014
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,336
<i>Introducing Stinger.</i>

1015
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:26,632
<i>KSI. We make the world.</i>

1016
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,136
That is a bad-ass robot.

1017
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,294
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

1018
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,475
<i>Here is the past. And now the future.</i>

1019
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,161
They're trying to build
their own versions.

1020
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:40,521
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars
than this.

1021
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,608
<i>You talk to me like that?</i>

1022
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:45,818
Bee, stop!

1023
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,195
You see what happens
from being a wiseass?

1024
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:49,947
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

1025
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,033
<i>Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee...</i>

1026
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,077
<i>...but better in every way.</i>

1027
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,204
<i>Son of a...</i>

1028
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,622
No, no! You gotta calm down.

1029
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,999
- He's crazy!
- Stop!

1030
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,877
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!

1031
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,066
OUR FACTORY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TRANSFORMIUM FOR PRODUCTION...

1032
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,342
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR PROMISE TO SUPPLY IT.

1033
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:13,303
My delicate flower, I can't
understand you when you're angry.

1034
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,514
Actually, I don't really understand you
at all.

1035
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,683
Our entire factory is up and running...

1036
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:19,393
Excuse me one second. Hey!

1037
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,645
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1038
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,065
What the hell is going on here?

1039
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,349
What's with this vintage crap?

1040
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,610
We're not scanning collector car junk.

1041
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:31,405
What do you think it is
that we make here?

1042
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:34,032
We make poetry. We're poets.

1043
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:38,078
All right? You work for me,
you get one mistake. One. Understood?

1044
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,889
- It won't happen again.
- It certainly won't.

1045
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,291
So let's get this pathetic thing
out of here.

1046
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:43,876
And you, too.

1047
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,586
So sorry. So sorry.

1048
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:47,796
Let's move on.

1049
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,440
Watch him.
I'm going to see what I can find.

1050
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,507
Quietly get out of here.

1051
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,427
I swear. I swear.
I can't bear it when you're angry.

1052
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,053
You know how it upsets me.

1053
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,746
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.

1054
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,771
<i>I'm perfectly calm, dude.</i>

1055
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:07,274
You gotta breathe,
or just do whatever it is that you do.

1056
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,151
<i>I'm calm. I'm calm.
I'm not even touching it.</i>

1057
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,004
<i>Okay, I'm barely touching it.
I'm barely touching it.</i>

1058
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:12,630
Oh, my God.
Turn back into a car right now!

1059
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,715
<i>Get out of my face, all right?</i>

1060
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:16,617
<i>Our design team
started with the Bumblebee.</i>

1061
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,286
<i>But really,
this alien's design was decrepit</i>

1062
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,621
<i>and, let's face it, antique.</i>

1063
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,206
<i>What the...</i>

1064
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,225
<i>- Don't</i> take <i>it personally, Bee.
- Kind of old and ratty.</i>

1065
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,709
<i>You mean ugly.</i>

1066
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,629
<i>- Hell, no!
- No! No!</i>

1067
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:30,672
<i>You think you're better than me!</i>

1068
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:39,932
What did you touch?

1069
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,482
My office in 15 minutes.

1070
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,525
<i>This is dissection room seven.</i>

1071
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:53,779
<i>Galvatron,
render postmortem number 12.</i>

1072
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,616
<i>Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.</i>

1073
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,998
So what about the deal? ls it done?

1074
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,041
Did you get the Seed?

1075
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,669
We get it
when the bounty hunter gets Prime.

1076
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,171
Meanwhile,
there has been a complication.

1077
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,464
A what?

1078
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:15,133
No, no.

1079
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,885
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

1080
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,598
A civilian harbouring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1081
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,518
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

1082
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:26,228
What?

1083
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,070
That was a little bit intense.

1084
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,449
I need more Transformium, and
I need it now, to build more prototypes.

1085
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,160
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1086
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:46,206
that I have staked my company
on this deal.

1087
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:48,250
And I have merely staked my life.

1088
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,711
Hey, you came to me on this,
remember?

1089
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,796
You retire from the CIA,

1090
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,757
you get a seven-figure piece
of my company, and you and I

1091
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:59,011
revolutionise national defence together.

1092
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:03,432
But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes,

1093
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:06,727
you need to deliver

1094
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,354
the Seed.

1095
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,081
<i>I'm in. Can you see my camera?</i>

1096
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,043
<i>They're melting Ratchet.</i>

1097
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,087
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1098
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,341
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1099
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:39,051
Metal.

1100
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:42,471
Just metal.
That's what I always thought of them.

1101
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,389
Well, they're not.

1102
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:46,391
They're living things,
with souls like ours.

1103
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,437
Once, I spoke to one.

1104
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,981
And you're working with Transformium?

1105
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,068
Yeah, that's what I do. I am.

1106
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,820
I'm out there digging for it.
There's just not much left to find.

1107
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,324
So that's how badly
you boys need more?

1108
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,167
Reduced to melting
evil old Decepticons down.

1109
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:08,455
No. That's an Autobot there.

1110
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:10,791
The ones who fought for us.

1111
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,460
- I've got this taken care of from here.
- Right.

1112
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,587
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

1113
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:18,090
I'm having the classified area
locked down now.

1114
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:26,807
Check that guy.

1115
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,394
Hey!

1116
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,354
Stop right there!

1117
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,692
Stop!

1118
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,741
Freeze!

1119
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:48,954
Up against the wall.

1120
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,330
All right.

1121
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:55,460
Corporate espionage.
That's a very serious crime, Mr Yeager.

1122
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,735
Look, I want a lawyer.

1123
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:22,946
The Justice Department.
Somebody I can trust.

1124
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,340
I'm just trying to protect my family,
okay?

1125
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:26,324
Not from your company,
from the government.

1126
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,534
Mr Yeager,

1127
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,494
who do you think I work for?

1128
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,789
You're trying to protect your family,
that's admirable.

1129
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,959
I'm trying to defend the nation
from alien war.

1130
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,311
We've had a taste
of what that looks like,

1131
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,546
and we are not gonna tolerate another.
Now...

1132
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:44,634
There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,

1133
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,688
your daughter
gets to graduate with honours,

1134
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,181
and life as you know it will go on.

1135
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:53,518
You have no idea
what you're involved with here.

1136
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,313
Really?

1137
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,483
What's the other version
of this conversation?

1138
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,569
The one when you send in
the hired help to murder my little girl?

1139
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,447
Or you gonna man up
and do it yourself?

1140
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,743
What's your preference?

1141
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,579
I'm going to ask you this once.

1142
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,831
Where is Optimus Prime?

1143
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,742
<i>Come on. Let's get out of here.</i>

1144
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:53,119
We're moving. Basement.

1145
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,123
They're here.

1146
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,962
Get out! All of you!

1147
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,547
Science fair's over, meatbags!

1148
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,982
- Destroy the lab!
- Move, move, move, move!

1149
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,217
Look out! Look out!

1150
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,136
Destroy it all!

1151
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:14,558
Danger! Security breach! Danger...

1152
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:17,435
Guys! It's me!

1153
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,312
Break me out of this Frankenstein box!

1154
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:20,689
Hey!

1155
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:21,773
Hey!

1156
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,693
Hey!

1157
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,027
Stop!

1158
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,696
That's company property!

1159
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,156
They're not your property!

1160
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:35,620
They were my friends.

1161
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,376
You ain't talking so much now!
You got Hound in front of you?

1162
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:42,711
Go ahead.

1163
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,889
Show us your true colours,
once and for all.

1164
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,341
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him.

1165
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,929
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here
that this is all the spoils of war.

1166
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:54,014
Dead metal.

1167
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,977
Innovation. What we do here is science.

1168
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:02,147
Because if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

1169
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,524
Because you cannot stop technology!

1170
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,819
We're not your technology!

1171
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,868
Let me vaporize his ass.

1172
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:19,331
I broke the code.
I own your whole genome.

1173
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,876
The world will know
what you're doing here.

1174
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,254
The world? The world will approve.

1175
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,882
We can make you now.

1176
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:33,219
Don't you get it?
We don't need you any more.

1177
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,556
That was cruel.

1178
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,771
Autobots,

1179
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,899
we're done.

1180
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,777
We're done?
We're not gonna kick a little bit of ass?

1181
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,904
I've been itching to kill something lately.

1182
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,656
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

1183
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:53,907
You have to stop him.

1184
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,384
It's never been tested in the field.

1185
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,661
Labs, military bases,
but not on civilian streets.

1186
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,412
Down there
a Defence Department contract

1187
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:01,122
was just attacked in a terrorist attack.

1188
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,917
This is now a CIA military op.

1189
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:07,379
You're indemnified. Respond!

1190
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:13,760
Let's go.

1191
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,180
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in.

1192
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,765
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.

1193
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,517
Bring up Galvatron.

1194
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,938
Transforming Galvatron.

1195
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,440
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

1196
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,528
<i>Bring up Stinger.</i>

1197
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,447
<i>Stinger coming online.</i>

1198
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:43,957
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.

1199
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,877
<i>Galvatron and Stinger are moving
to intercept targets.</i>

1200
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:56,594
<i>Reapers. Five targets in the open.
Good picture.</i>

1201
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,600
Two miles to intercept.

1202
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,196
200 meters.

1203
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,073
Engage-.

1204
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:19,117
Transform.

1205
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,769
We are programming this, right?

1206
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,896
Yes. Mostly.

1207
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,981
<i>Systems seem to have malfunctioned.</i>

1208
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,650
Targeting five bogeys.

1209
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:54,694
Engaging rockets.

1210
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:55,904
Missiles away.

1211
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,504
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on!

1212
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,050
<i>Stinger is in pursuit.</i>

1213
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,396
Misfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire!

1214
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,732
System failure.
Galvatron just fired four rockets.

1215
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,567
They're shooting at us!

1216
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,319
Watch out! What are you doing?

1217
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,118
<i>What was that?</i>

1218
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:28,517
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

1219
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,766
I mean, you got a lot of people
in the crossfire here. I don't like...

1220
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:33,251
You're making history here.
For your country, for the world.

1221
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:35,336
Human freedom is at stake.

1222
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,422
Innocent people die all the time.

1223
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:45,638
Come on, Optimus!

1224
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,832
Tessa!

1225
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,927
Make him fight. Don't let him go down.

1226
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,178
Make him fight!

1227
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,078
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

1228
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,854
Tessa!

1229
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,981
Tessa!

1230
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,358
Tessa, run to the field!

1231
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,617
You have no soul!

1232
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,287
That is why I have no fear!

1233
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,623
You die!

1234
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:07,553
Help me!

1235
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,995
What is that?

1236
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,290
That's my asset. Pull Galvatron back.

1237
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,667
Do it.

1238
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,074
I got to go get her.

1239
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,079
Tessa!

1240
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:17,814
Don't go out there! He'll kill you!

1241
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,917
- She needs my help!
- She's hidden!

1242
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:21,961
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up!

1243
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,797
I can't. Get out of here.

1244
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:32,555
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.

1245
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:39,312
The trouble with loyalty to a cause
is that the cause will always betray you.

1246
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,315
Who sent you here?

1247
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,817
Where do you think you came from?

1248
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,652
You think you were born?

1249
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,573
No. You were built.

1250
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,618
And your creators want you back.

1251
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:56,829
We all work for someone.

1252
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,674
No, no.

1253
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:10,843
No.

1254
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:12,512
It's got her!

1255
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:13,888
- She's in the car!
- Tessa!

1256
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,681
- No!
- Tessa!

1257
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:22,396
Dad!

1258
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,732
Tessa, get out!

1259
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:26,859
Get out!

1260
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:28,945
Tessa!

1261
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,408
Get out! Tessa!

1262
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:35,660
Dad, help me!

1263
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,412
- Tessa!
- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!

1264
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,377
Dad!

1265
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,379
- Dad!
- Tessa! Break the glass!

1266
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,589
- Break the glass to get out!
- I'm trying!

1267
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,925
- Tessa, I can't hold on!
- Dad!

1268
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:52,218
Tessa!

1269
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,595
- Help me!
- Just break it! Break the glass!

1270
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:55,805
Tess...

1271
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,936
Cade, warn the Autobots!

1272
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,730
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

1273
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,733
No!

1274
01:23:36,429 --> 01:23:38,764
Take that human to the trash.

1275
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,611
Mr Secretary.

1276
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:56,073
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1277
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:58,701
This is my asset.

1278
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,621
Tell the military to stand down.

1279
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,026
Hang on, I have the White House.

1280
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,332
<i>Agent, hello!</i>

1281
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:05,541
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1282
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,020
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the White House.

1283
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,421
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.

1284
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,303
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

1285
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,259
and I'm not sure
when you said anything about

1286
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,094
a "giant alien warship
over Michigan Avenue."

1287
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,472
Tell the President this is not an attack.

1288
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,273
Remember this ship, Prime?

1289
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:32,068
Built for all you Knights,
you great crusaders,

1290
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:34,320
to explore the universe.

1291
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,324
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1292
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:35,631
Optimus?

1293
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:46,600
Welcome back
to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1294
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:51,022
You have disgraced it.

1295
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:59,780
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1296
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,909
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.

1297
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,619
It's taken centuries,

1298
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:09,832
but I've collected all the Knights but you.

1299
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:20,968
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1300
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,308
I'm slave to no one.

1301
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:32,480
All this species mixing with species.

1302
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,358
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1303
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:37,735
The creators, they don't like it.

1304
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:42,156
They built you to do what you were told.

1305
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:45,826
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1306
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,991
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

1307
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,206
<i>Savoy, mission accomplished.</i>

1308
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:53,125
<i>Lockdown has Prime.
The deal's going down now.</i>

1309
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,019
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.

1310
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,769
<i>Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.</i>

1311
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:37,920
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1312
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,215
Our deal is done.
One Prime for one Seed.

1313
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,678
Handle it with care.

1314
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:51,475
I trust your species is ready.

1315
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,644
Don't worry about our species.

1316
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,605
Farewell, Earth.

1317
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:08,200
Come on, come on!

1318
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:21,380
Bee, come on!

1319
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:26,886
It's a bad idea.
But I'm all about bad ideas.

1320
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,971
Let's go!

1321
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,266
Well, let's rock.

1322
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,120
This is crazy.

1323
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:54,764
Look, you wanna cut and run,
you better do it now.

1324
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,123
I'm gonna die trying.

1325
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,918
Hey, I'm not here to help you
get your daughter.

1326
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,599
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.

1327
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:06,592
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.

1328
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:18,354
We're behind enemy lines now.

1329
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:21,732
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.
Eyes open.

1330
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,652
Beware of his bone grinders,
brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1331
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:25,778
chromosomal inverters,

1332
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:29,323
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,
and, of course, radiation.

1333
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:32,368
We must be quick.
We have the element of surprise.

1334
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:35,162
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1335
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:37,957
Get it!

1336
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,208
I kill you! Kill you!

1337
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:40,876
I hate those things.

1338
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,337
- That's freaky.
- He's not alive any more.

1339
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,839
Well, we looked.
They're not here. Let's go.

1340
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,259
What? Hey, I'm not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1341
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,886
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?

1342
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:52,930
What's in it for you?

1343
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:56,308
Easy. Let's use words.

1344
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:59,603
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1345
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:03,107
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

1346
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,070
Okay, okay.
Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.

1347
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:10,990
Well, then.
We'll need to sabotage something.

1348
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,910
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

1349
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,413
- Wonderful.
- I give us 10 minutes.

1350
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,623
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up?

1351
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:21,345
Are you telling me
that thing's gonna be...

1352
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,228
This is gonna be flying out of here
in 10 minutes?

1353
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:25,671
- Ten minutes?
- Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1354
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,024
- Humans, search the cell blocks.
- We're wasting time, let's go.

1355
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:30,259
- We'll find the centre core.
- Let's move.

1356
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:32,428
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship.

1357
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,695
We're never gonna find her
in this huge ship.

1358
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,655
Like a needle in a haystack.

1359
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:53,949
Tessa!

1360
01:30:54,867 --> 01:30:56,201
Great. Great.

1361
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:00,664
That was smooth.

1362
01:31:00,748 --> 01:31:03,459
No, that was really smooth,
letting everybody know we're here.

1363
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,210
Now they're gonna be looking for us.

1364
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:17,389
Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space!

1365
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,059
Here's the little jujube right here.

1366
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,437
Hello, Mama.

1367
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,743
Who fired the anchors?

1368
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:44,917
Who's on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1369
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,382
Hurry up. We got like six minutes.

1370
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:52,466
We'll find her.

1371
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:55,719
Hold up.

1372
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:00,307
Back up.

1373
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:05,432
Come on, these things
are gonna find us. Hurry, hide.

1374
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,661
Weapons!

1375
01:33:03,454 --> 01:33:05,622
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry.

1376
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:12,963
Help me up.

1377
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,549
There are some weird sounds out there.

1378
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,054
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1379
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,514
You ready?

1380
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:04,932
Run.

1381
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:16,113
All right, we're not going down
without a fight.

1382
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:20,465
They turn that corner,
and we're gonna take them.

1383
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:21,549
You ready
or you gonna bitch out on me?

1384
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,616
No, I got your back.

1385
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:23,951
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

1386
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,181
Don't bitch out on me. Are you ready?

1387
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:29,331
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1388
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,918
Okay! I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender!

1389
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:40,342
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry!

1390
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:41,820
What'd you do? How'd you do that?

1391
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:42,970
I have no idea!

1392
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,681
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!

1393
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,308
Look at that. You see that?

1394
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,271
You stay here, Lucky Charms!

1395
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:13,625
Man. I am so gonna patent this shit.

1396
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:29,641
Tess!

1397
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:32,477
Dad! Help me!

1398
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:33,937
Hey!

1399
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:35,397
- Tess?
- Tess!

1400
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,321
Come on, move, move!

1401
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,615
Tessa!

1402
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,367
Shane, I love you! I love you!
You saved me! You saved me!

1403
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:48,452
I know. I know.

1404
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:51,997
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1405
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:55,459
- Thank you. You saved me.
- Yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

1406
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,793
Yeah.

1407
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:59,647
I think you and Mr "I Surrender"
have a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

1408
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,274
He saved me, too.
You should have seen him in there.

1409
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:04,509
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

1410
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:07,054
- Eyes open.
- I almost got it.

1411
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:10,098
Big boy coming through!
Move, move, move.

1412
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:15,562
This has got to be the Supermax.
Watch the corners.

1413
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:17,522
There's a lot of cages.

1414
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,691
Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.

1415
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,194
I don't want to know
what's in the big cage.

1416
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,988
- What's this?
- Hound, don't do it.

1417
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:27,449
You don't look very dangerous in there.

1418
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:31,662
That's festering ugliness.

1419
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:34,706
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting!

1420
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:35,749
It burns!

1421
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,627
I think it's acid!

1422
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,964
Nuts. It's just shizzle.

1423
01:36:43,173 --> 01:36:45,050
I hope that's not contagious.

1424
01:36:45,092 --> 01:36:48,053
I got to hurt you now.
You're just too disturbing to live.

1425
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:50,138
Take that, bitch!

1426
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:53,100
You're dead.

1427
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:55,435
- Hound!
- He's alive!

1428
01:36:55,644 --> 01:36:56,853
Hold on, boss, we're coming!

1429
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:59,064
- Optimus, sound off!
- In here, quick!

1430
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,524
Hang on, we're coming for you!

1431
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,359
The arms of this Knight Ship detach!

1432
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:05,362
We can break free! It's a separate ship!
Hurry!

1433
01:37:05,445 --> 01:37:06,845
Where's the cockpit? Right or left?

1434
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:08,240
- Right!
- I'm on it, boss.

1435
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,575
Hurry. We have no time.

1436
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:11,743
<i>Sensei.</i>

1437
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:15,330
Let's rock! I always wanted
to fly one of these things.

1438
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:16,748
I'm there, boss!

1439
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,503
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

1440
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,964
you gonna invent us
a way out of this one?

1441
01:37:32,014 --> 01:37:33,432
Oh, my God.

1442
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:35,934
I am not doing this.

1443
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,103
- I am not doing that.
- Yes, we are.

1444
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:41,231
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.

1445
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:42,941
No way.

1446
01:37:43,233 --> 01:37:45,086
Sweetie, you know why I'm here?
I'm here to protect you.

1447
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,150
You've done great at that.

1448
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,966
I want you to trust me right now.
We're getting down. Let's go.

1449
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:57,706
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

1450
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,794
Careful, these cables
are starting to get thinner here!

1451
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,756
- Step. Step. There.
- Oh, my God!

1452
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,425
See, don't look down!
All right? Don't look down.

1453
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:10,802
We're gonna be at the building
in no time!

1454
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:13,263
You okay, Tess?

1455
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:15,265
Keep stepping-

1456
01:38:16,016 --> 01:38:18,185
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dad!

1457
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:25,275
All right, sweetie.
You need to keep moving here, okay?

1458
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:27,110
- Come on!
- I can't.

1459
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,029
I'm freaking out.

1460
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,238
You need to move now!

1461
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:33,825
I'm not moving!
I'm going back to the ship!

1462
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:37,871
Shit!

1463
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,016
You can't go back to the ship, honey!

1464
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,041
Watch me!

1465
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:43,227
You are not 18 years old yet
and you're gonna do what I say!

1466
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,252
Now let's go!

1467
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:54,387
We need to go this way, okay.
Not that way.

1468
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:55,889
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

1469
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,182
Come on, for God's sake.

1470
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:58,809
Do not start with me.

1471
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:05,357
Oh, my God, what is that?

1472
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:06,650
All right, Tessa.

1473
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,401
Don't look back.

1474
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:10,695
Well, don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

1475
01:39:10,904 --> 01:39:12,239
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1476
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:14,116
Well, that means it's totally major!

1477
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,676
I'm gonna have to point this gun
in your direction.

1478
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,245
It's gonna feel like it's in your direction,
but I'm not.

1479
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,668
- You better hurry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

1480
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,684
I had to bust my ass
to get up here on this spaceship!

1481
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,210
- Shoot it!
- Get down now!

1482
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,149
Tessa, wait! I'm coming for you! Tessa!

1483
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,328
- Oh, my God!
- I'm coming!

1484
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:02,164
Hold on!

1485
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,439
You're the best, Bee! You are the best.

1486
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,900
<i>You damn right! And don't ever forget it.</i>

1487
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,235
You see that? Look at me!
We're off the ship, right?

1488
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:34,863
Bumblebee! Bumblebee! Friendly!

1489
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:38,867
Enemy ships are coming in hot.
Get on! Get on!

1490
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:51,004
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it!

1491
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:03,342
They got three ships on them!

1492
01:41:03,475 --> 01:41:05,518
I'm giving it the juice!

1493
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,524
Come on, Bee, take them out!

1494
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:17,822
Good move, Bee!

1495
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:20,533
This one's for you, A-holes!

1496
01:41:34,673 --> 01:41:36,234
If you're gonna do something,
you better do it!

1497
01:41:36,258 --> 01:41:37,676
Come on!

1498
01:41:39,344 --> 01:41:42,806
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot.

1499
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,017
Hey, you better let me fire
this big-ass gun

1500
01:41:46,059 --> 01:41:47,560
and make this ship go faster!

1501
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,065
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns.

1502
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,110
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

1503
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:56,194
What?

1504
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,297
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1505
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,823
Wait. What're you talking about?

1506
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,175
- I don't know what he means.
- Good luck.

1507
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,742
Where are you going?

1508
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,286
To lay some hate.

1509
01:42:14,379 --> 01:42:15,380
- Say it!
- Okay.

1510
01:42:15,422 --> 01:42:16,506
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1511
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:17,882
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1512
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,050
Go!

1513
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,063
Yeah, I got one!

1514
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:35,275
These alien guns kick ass!

1515
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:40,030
Come on, he's on us!

1516
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,656
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1517
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:46,661
Bee, fire the gun!

1518
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,983
That was insane!

1519
01:43:17,317 --> 01:43:18,651
Tess, you okay?

1520
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:29,662
Okay. Sir?

1521
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:34,167
You better have insurance!

1522
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:37,796
Insurance?

1523
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:39,672
It's a freaking spaceship.

1524
01:43:40,173 --> 01:43:41,933
You go get insurance
on a freaking spaceship.

1525
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,046
Good luck with that, buddy.

1526
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,221
Is this your car? Huh?

1527
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,476
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1528
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:52,811
Here you go.

1529
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:55,105
Come here.

1530
01:43:55,814 --> 01:43:57,690
- Trust your dad.
- Okay.

1531
01:44:04,531 --> 01:44:07,659
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1532
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:17,836
We're almost ready to separate.
We're almost there.

1533
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:20,004
- Hurry, he's launching!
- All over it, chief.

1534
01:44:20,046 --> 01:44:23,174
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I'm gone.

1535
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:25,677
I'm a sucky pilot, but let's give it a whirl.

1536
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,178
Hell, yeah!

1537
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,814
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1538
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,608
What a deft hand.
I'm sure nobody noticed all that.

1539
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,705
Look. In a few minutes, there are
gonna be feds all over this place,

1540
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,947
and I don't want them
finding our Holy Grail.

1541
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:49,200
So we're gonna take all our R&D,
we're moving it to our China facility.

1542
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:50,285
Yeah.

1543
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:54,038
I want you to bring me the Seed,
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1544
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:59,377
Mr Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

1545
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,921
We have plenty of time
for improvements in China.

1546
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:05,884
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

1547
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,135
A fiasco.

1548
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:10,180
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1549
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:13,224
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1550
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:14,986
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley?
A flaw?

1551
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:18,563
A flaw is a total failure.

1552
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:23,902
I did not have control over my prototype,
and I want to know why!

1553
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:46,216
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1554
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,678
You humans. After all we have done.

1555
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:53,515
You don't know
what you've wrought upon yourselves.

1556
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:55,892
What? What is it now?
What are you talking about?

1557
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:57,734
I mean, I'm doing stuff
out of my league here!

1558
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,189
You don't see who's controlling who.

1559
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,067
Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1560
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:07,028
I sensed the presence

1561
01:46:07,362 --> 01:46:08,696
of Megatron.

1562
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,991
What, the Decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

1563
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:15,203
How do you think KSI
built those bots in the first place?

1564
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,746
They had a whole mess of

1565
01:46:16,913 --> 01:46:19,999
<i>dead Decepticon heads
and they were downloading their minds!</i>

1566
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,210
<i>And I was in charge of autopsy duty.</i>

1567
01:46:22,335 --> 01:46:25,046
<i>No union, no benefits, no nothing.</i>

1568
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:26,965
<i>They hooked me up to Megatron,</i>

1569
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,217
<i>and that mind
wasn't as dead as they thought.</i>

1570
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,386
<i>He fed them the science and specs!</i>

1571
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,264
<i>All so they could build him
a brand-new body.</i>

1572
01:46:35,515 --> 01:46:38,935
<i>Then he infected it
with his evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>

1573
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:44,148
<i>They had red, beady eyes.
They got all in my lovely locks.</i>

1574
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:45,650
<i>I can smell it right now.</i>

1575
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:47,986
<i>Total inside custom job!</i>

1576
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:53,408
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1577
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,327
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!

1578
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:58,329
You knew this
and you didn't warn them?

1579
01:46:58,413 --> 01:47:02,750
Little girl, you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

1580
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,336
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1581
01:47:05,962 --> 01:47:09,799
all so that he could manipulate them
into going after the Seed.

1582
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,343
Wait. The Seed?

1583
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:14,846
Those nasty soldiers
that were chasing us.

1584
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:16,055
<i>I saw them board the ship,</i>

1585
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:18,516
<i>and they took something
that they called the Seed.</i>

1586
01:47:18,683 --> 01:47:21,436
Listen. Sixty million years ago,
give or take an eon...

1587
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,106
Thousands of planets
were cyber-formed with Seeds.

1588
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:33,406
<i>They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.</i>

1589
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:39,287
<i>Our creators destroyed your world
to make us.</i>

1590
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:42,624
And that's what Galvatron
wants to happen again.

1591
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:46,961
He wants to detonate that Seed
in the biggest city and kill millions!

1592
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,922
He's gonna show the world,
"Baby, I'm back."

1593
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:54,761
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into moulten metal.

1594
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:58,056
He'll have enough
to build a massive army

1595
01:47:58,306 --> 01:48:01,934
and annihilate your species forever.

1596
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:05,021
You dumb, greedy bastards
just brought extinction to yourself.

1597
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,815
Not my problem, though. I'm free at last.

1598
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:10,109
Whole thing worked out good for me.
I'm walking.

1599
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:12,570
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

1600
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,088
<i>The Seed is going to be
the salvation of our company.</i>

1601
01:48:31,089 --> 01:48:32,965
We take delivery tonight.

1602
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:36,135
And next month, we detonate safely
in the Mongolian desert.

1603
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:40,598
And we'll create enough Transformium
for a hundred years.

1604
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:48,064
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing.

1605
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:49,816
Well, a place to sleep.

1606
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:51,943
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1607
01:48:57,615 --> 01:48:58,950
You know, when I was your age,

1608
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:02,954
I liked to get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

1609
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:08,835
But then there was Tessa.

1610
01:49:09,419 --> 01:49:11,313
And when she was born,
all I ever wanted out of life

1611
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:13,423
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

1612
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,427
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

1613
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:20,888
But I won't be.

1614
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,807
I'll never be.

1615
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,310
So somebody better be.

1616
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,151
Thanks for being here today,
Lucky Charms.

1617
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:38,823
Well, thanks for not shooting me
when you had the chance.

1618
01:49:39,282 --> 01:49:40,408
I'll have more.

1619
01:49:42,452 --> 01:49:44,120
Yeah, I can see that.

1620
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:48,166
We've intercepted
the encrypted communications.

1621
01:49:48,249 --> 01:49:52,837
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory
in Guangzhou, China.

1622
01:49:53,379 --> 01:49:55,006
Hey, big shot.

1623
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:58,259
Your company's in serious trouble.

1624
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:00,094
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1625
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:01,179
<i>Really?</i>

1626
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,531
Well, you better have a great one 'cause

1627
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:05,099
you're about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

1628
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:06,392
<i>Now, you listen to me.</i>

1629
01:50:06,476 --> 01:50:08,728
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

1630
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:11,105
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.

1631
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,609
<i>Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.</i>

1632
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:17,653
<i>Do not let Galvatron
anywhere near that Seed.</i>

1633
01:50:17,695 --> 01:50:20,156
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1634
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:22,325
Deep down, I know you know.

1635
01:50:23,451 --> 01:50:25,828
<i>Your prototype's been controlling you.</i>

1636
01:50:29,499 --> 01:50:31,709
How fast can that thing get us
halfway around the world?

1637
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:35,087
Very. It's a spaceship.

1638
01:50:51,938 --> 01:50:55,024
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1639
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:59,445
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1640
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:07,745
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1641
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,548
She's a keeper.

1642
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:20,466
Must take after her mom.

1643
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,262
I can't argue with that, kid.

1644
01:51:25,471 --> 01:51:28,558
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,

1645
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,727
but then we're done
defending the humans.

1646
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:34,272
What, done?
What do you mean, you're done?

1647
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:37,483
Means "finished," "see ya," "good-bye."

1648
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:55,793
Hijacked part of my ship?
How did you let this happen?

1649
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:59,046
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

1650
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,548
and get us back!

1651
01:52:00,882 --> 01:52:03,634
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1652
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:06,596
And he will feel my wrath!

1653
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:15,521
Welcome to China.

1654
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:18,691
Put Galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs do not activate him.

1655
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:19,817
Absolutely, sir.

1656
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:21,986
<i>L</i> WANT SECURITY ON HIGH ALERT.

1657
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,407
Joyce.

1658
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:30,828
I cannot tell you
how enthused I am to deliver this.

1659
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,708
Top of your alien wish list.

1660
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:39,086
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1661
01:52:41,547 --> 01:52:43,466
I will need to see my advance.

1662
01:52:43,883 --> 01:52:46,510
Five million shares of the company.

1663
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:48,137
Together,
we're gonna end human warfare.

1664
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,432
<i>We're about to build
a fully automated U.S. Army.</i>

1665
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:54,352
<i>Just think of all the American lives
we're gonna save.</i>

1666
01:53:03,945 --> 01:53:08,824
ALL OF THESE CARS ARE KSI'S NEWEST CIVILIAN PROTOTYPE ROBOTS.

1667
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:11,577
So how soon until
we can start continuous production?

1668
01:53:23,047 --> 01:53:27,385
You know, why don't we take
a beat on this for a minute?

1669
01:53:28,177 --> 01:53:30,846
I have some new data
that I discovered and...

1670
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:32,199
You're not backing out on me here?

1671
01:53:32,223 --> 01:53:33,766
No, I'm not backing out. I just...

1672
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:36,185
I want the Seed.
I'm not saying I don't want the Seed.

1673
01:53:36,227 --> 01:53:38,396
I'm just saying I don't know if l...

1674
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,564
If I want the Seed right now.

1675
01:53:40,898 --> 01:53:44,235
Good men have died
trying to get that thing for us.

1676
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,403
<i>For you.</i>

1677
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,989
I know what you did to get that thing.

1678
01:53:48,072 --> 01:53:50,032
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1679
01:53:50,408 --> 01:53:53,244
I can take you down, too, Mr Black Ops.
Don't you threaten me.

1680
01:53:54,245 --> 01:53:56,414
I started this company when I was a boy,

1681
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:59,125
with a dream
of making the world a better place.

1682
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:01,877
Funny. I had the same dream.

1683
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:06,048
Somewhere along the way,
you made billions of dollars.

1684
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:08,485
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

1685
01:54:08,509 --> 01:54:11,095
Why don't you tell me what's missing
from my boyhood dream?

1686
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:17,101
I have served my country for decades
of unparalleled prosperity

1687
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,979
and you are my golden parachute.

1688
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:23,816
So you are damn well
jumping out of the plane with me!

1689
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:37,538
I am Galvatron!

1690
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:46,213
- What's going on?
- Your Galvatron has gone active.

1691
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,133
What haven't you been telling me?

1692
01:54:49,175 --> 01:54:52,136
Find Darcy, and bring a car around
downstairs. Quietly.

1693
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:55,668
We got a factory emergency.
I have to get you out of here.

1694
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:57,853
- What the hell's going on?
- Take them outside.

1695
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,144
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

1696
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:02,646
I got what "it" wanted.

1697
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,652
My brothers,
today I grant you your freedom.

1698
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:13,824
And from now on,
you are commanded by me.

1699
01:55:14,784 --> 01:55:16,118
Rise up!

1700
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:20,331
Go find my Seed!

1701
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:38,015
Detonate the Seed in the largest city.

1702
01:55:40,017 --> 01:55:41,953
Listen, princess.
I don't wanna hear, "I told you so,"

1703
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,737
but this is much more dangerous
than I think.

1704
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,064
Get in.

1705
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,280
Galvatron's hacked into the others.

1706
01:55:53,364 --> 01:55:54,824
- What?
- Joshua.

1707
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:56,587
- You have to contain this!
- Drive, drive!

1708
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,035
Son of a...

1709
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:03,040
Come on.
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1710
01:56:18,931 --> 01:56:20,724
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1711
01:56:21,058 --> 01:56:23,561
I know a military garrison there
that will help us.

1712
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:27,106
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1713
01:56:28,065 --> 01:56:30,901
Possibly not my finest hour.
I'd like to have that one back.

1714
01:56:30,943 --> 01:56:33,112
Killer? I thought they were your friends!

1715
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,157
No. Not friends. Business.
They gave me this bomb.

1716
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:38,075
Bomb?

1717
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:39,535
Is there a bomb in the bag?

1718
01:56:39,577 --> 01:56:41,704
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1719
01:56:41,745 --> 01:56:42,830
Shit.

1720
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:55,068
<i>When you said you were done
fighting for humans,</i>

1721
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:57,261
you didn't mean that, did you?

1722
01:56:57,303 --> 01:57:00,681
How many more of my kind
must be sacrificed

1723
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:03,100
to atone for your mistakes?

1724
01:57:03,309 --> 01:57:04,578
Well, what do you think
being human means?

1725
01:57:04,602 --> 01:57:05,686
That's what we do.

1726
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:07,730
We make mistakes.

1727
01:57:08,606 --> 01:57:11,483
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

1728
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:19,909
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.

1729
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:23,454
That was it. That was why. For money.

1730
01:57:24,622 --> 01:57:26,832
And it was me making a mistake.

1731
01:57:27,583 --> 01:57:29,835
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1732
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:36,300
So even if you got no faith in us,
I'm asking you to do what I do.

1733
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:39,261
I'm asking you to look at all the junk
and see the treasure.

1734
01:57:40,262 --> 01:57:44,266
You gotta have faith, Prime,
in who we can be.

1735
01:57:56,195 --> 01:57:58,572
I'm seriously pissed
we're not getting paid for this.

1736
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:01,867
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1737
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:04,941
They're not getting away if
I still got him on satellite.

1738
01:58:05,663 --> 01:58:08,332
Some genius.
Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1739
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:11,293
- Joshua?
- Yes?

1740
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:13,170
How lethal is that bomb?

1741
01:58:13,879 --> 01:58:15,339
I don't know. Let me check.

1742
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:24,515
I love this! This is so good. Hang on.

1743
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:28,394
I'm getting a text from
ll Duce in Hong Kong.

1744
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:31,563
"Need to know
the Seed's estimated blast range."

1745
01:58:41,991 --> 01:58:45,035
I'll do the diversion!
Get that thing somewhere safe!

1746
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:52,501
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go!

1747
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,086
GUYS, guys...

1748
01:58:54,253 --> 01:58:55,855
- Shut up! Shut up!
- All right! I'm sorry!

1749
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,079
All right, go ahead, go ahead!

1750
01:59:00,092 --> 01:59:02,553
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!

1751
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:06,348
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

1752
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,934
I need a raise! I want a raise.

1753
01:59:09,018 --> 01:59:10,698
All right, yes!
I'm sure whatever you want!

1754
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:15,816
Go, go, go!

1755
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:19,069
No!

1756
01:59:21,947 --> 01:59:23,667
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail!

1757
01:59:30,956 --> 01:59:33,751
Get out of the way, all of you!
Get out of the way!

1758
01:59:35,878 --> 01:59:37,671
I don't want to die like this.

1759
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,772
Box them in.

1760
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:09,787
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

1761
02:00:09,912 --> 02:00:11,952
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere.
You're amazing!

1762
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:13,665
We're going to get you to the roof.

1763
02:00:13,749 --> 02:00:14,750
Good, good.

1764
02:00:20,714 --> 02:00:21,799
Go!

1765
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:34,103
LOL. That's funny.

1766
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,522
I can't... This is really happening.

1767
02:00:36,814 --> 02:00:40,818
A man, me, who is worth
over 20 billion dollars is now

1768
02:00:41,318 --> 02:00:44,822
being chased by CIA assassins.
That's the truth.

1769
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:48,033
And in the middle of a robot uprising.

1770
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:53,789
And I'm carrying what is,
in essence, a tactical nuke.

1771
02:00:54,623 --> 02:00:57,459
And the great thing is I...
The great thing is that I'm...

1772
02:00:57,501 --> 02:00:59,044
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

1773
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:00,671
- Just stop it!
- What?

1774
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:02,804
You need to hide on the roof
of this building.

1775
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:04,591
I'll get you a helicopter extraction.

1776
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:08,720
Okay.

1777
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:13,016
I like her.

1778
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:14,805
I find her very attractive.

1779
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:18,730
He's definitely around here.

1780
02:01:19,398 --> 02:01:20,732
Come on, come on.

1781
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:24,319
I got a bike!

1782
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,321
Check in there!

1783
02:01:26,822 --> 02:01:28,824
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

1784
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:34,455
- Guys.
- Let's go.

1785
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:36,748
Hello.

1786
02:01:43,464 --> 02:01:44,882
Hey! Okay.

1787
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:53,370
- Pick it up.
- All right. I'm gonna.

1788
02:02:10,616 --> 02:02:13,160
Thank you. How did you...

1789
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:15,662
Police training, prior to my MBA.

1790
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:17,623
I love you.

1791
02:02:19,082 --> 02:02:20,209
Get to the roof.

1792
02:02:20,501 --> 02:02:21,502
All right, okay.

1793
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:19,101
Find my Seed. It's here!

1794
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,812
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

1795
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,363
No!

1796
02:03:32,197 --> 02:03:34,032
No, no, no, no!

1797
02:03:37,995 --> 02:03:39,288
Who the hell's aboard that?

1798
02:03:39,663 --> 02:03:41,164
Impossible.

1799
02:03:48,839 --> 02:03:53,385
Brothers, it's the Autobots!
Shoot them down!

1800
02:03:58,849 --> 02:03:59,891
Joshua!

1801
02:03:59,975 --> 02:04:01,059
Hey, Baldy!

1802
02:04:01,435 --> 02:04:02,728
Hey, it's me! Hey!

1803
02:04:02,978 --> 02:04:04,098
Bring it over now! Let's go.

1804
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:06,732
Hurry up, run!

1805
02:04:07,107 --> 02:04:09,026
- Hurry! Come on!
- Let's go! Move it!

1806
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:11,528
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!

1807
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:13,822
Looks like we might have company.

1808
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:25,667
We're hit! We're hit!

1809
02:04:51,652 --> 02:04:54,488
They live, they talk, we're dead.

1810
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,240
- Kill them all.
- Pleasure.

1811
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,745
I count ten below!

1812
02:05:02,913 --> 02:05:05,033
I thought you said
you had one prototype get infected.

1813
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:07,250
Now he's got operational control
of my other 50.

1814
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:08,502
Come on.

1815
02:05:10,337 --> 02:05:12,422
Climb, climb!

1816
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,841
Surround them.

1817
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:22,391
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.

1818
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,184
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

1819
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,245
I'm about one second away
from knocking you out,

1820
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:27,622
taking the bomb,
and just leaving you here.

1821
02:05:27,646 --> 02:05:29,064
Please, do me a favour.

1822
02:05:29,523 --> 02:05:32,067
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

1823
02:05:32,109 --> 02:05:33,193
- Come on, bitch!
- Come on!

1824
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:46,957
Evac! Evac!

1825
02:05:47,124 --> 02:05:48,542
We're getting flanked!

1826
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,628
We got company below!

1827
02:05:55,215 --> 02:05:58,593
My fat ass is stuck! Bee, take the shot!

1828
02:06:08,937 --> 02:06:10,480
- Into the elevator! Get in.
- Okay.

1829
02:06:10,564 --> 02:06:11,606
Come on.

1830
02:06:14,985 --> 02:06:16,403
Get down, get down!

1831
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:18,488
Close the door! Close the door!

1832
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:22,951
Won't go! It's not closing!

1833
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,453
There's too much weight.

1834
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:26,329
- Get back down to Bumblebee!
- Dad, no!

1835
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,915
Hey! You want me!

1836
02:06:39,426 --> 02:06:40,427
Centre elevator.

1837
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:42,012
<i>Centre elevator.</i>

1838
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:47,934
He's gonna be okay.

1839
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:03,533
Alien bomb! Alien bomb,
coming through!

1840
02:07:03,992 --> 02:07:05,702
Clear the way! Clear the... Hi, kids.

1841
02:07:05,786 --> 02:07:07,329
Coming through, ladies!

1842
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:09,748
Excuse me!
Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me!

1843
02:07:09,915 --> 02:07:10,916
Oh, my God!

1844
02:07:11,082 --> 02:07:13,322
How do you say, "Get the fuck
out of the way" in Chinese?

1845
02:07:57,963 --> 02:08:00,298
That's a long way down.

1846
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,469
You've got to be kidding me.

1847
02:08:06,555 --> 02:08:07,806
No!

1848
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:21,570
Come on.

1849
02:08:33,665 --> 02:08:35,000
I'm coming for you!

1850
02:09:10,285 --> 02:09:11,995
Never should have hidden that truck.

1851
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,122
You should have never
came after my family.

1852
02:09:14,164 --> 02:09:17,000
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family.

1853
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:19,336
Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine.

1854
02:09:43,026 --> 02:09:45,862
<i>Where is my escaped bounty?</i>

1855
02:09:45,904 --> 02:09:47,697
Autobots at this location.

1856
02:09:48,365 --> 02:09:50,033
Prime is close.

1857
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,411
Do whatever you have to do.

1858
02:09:54,871 --> 02:09:56,373
I intend to.

1859
02:09:58,917 --> 02:10:00,543
- Darcy!
- Joshua!

1860
02:10:00,752 --> 02:10:02,021
We got three more
coming in from that way!

1861
02:10:02,045 --> 02:10:03,672
Bee, where's Tessa?

1862
02:10:04,714 --> 02:10:05,715
Dad!

1863
02:10:08,635 --> 02:10:11,888
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?
I created incredible robots.

1864
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:14,474
It's all designed
to kick that fat Transformer's ass.

1865
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:17,310
So, really, this is a no-win situation.

1866
02:10:17,394 --> 02:10:18,645
It's over.

1867
02:10:18,728 --> 02:10:19,729
That was mean.

1868
02:10:19,938 --> 02:10:23,233
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle
the cold-hearted truth!

1869
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,111
<i>Optimus, what are my orders
with these humans?</i>

1870
02:10:26,194 --> 02:10:27,570
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

1871
02:10:27,612 --> 02:10:29,072
They're in trouble.

1872
02:10:29,114 --> 02:10:30,907
Nah! This isn't our fight!

1873
02:10:30,991 --> 02:10:33,785
I'm done being an underdog.
Underdogs suck!

1874
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,745
I say they get what they deserve.

1875
02:10:35,787 --> 02:10:37,247
What's the play, Prime?

1876
02:10:37,455 --> 02:10:40,333
It's time for reinforcements.

1877
02:10:42,669 --> 02:10:45,839
Recognise one of your Knights.

1878
02:11:06,026 --> 02:11:08,945
THE LEGEND EXISTS.

1879
02:11:16,202 --> 02:11:17,579
Come on.

1880
02:11:18,872 --> 02:11:20,874
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!

1881
02:11:21,124 --> 02:11:22,292
Bee, go!

1882
02:11:26,796 --> 02:11:28,965
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

1883
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:35,180
Where's Tessa?
Tessa, get over here! Come on.

1884
02:11:35,263 --> 02:11:36,556
Get over here!

1885
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:39,142
Stay behind me! I'm covering you!

1886
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:41,644
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead.

1887
02:11:41,686 --> 02:11:42,937
But that ain't gonna happen.

1888
02:11:44,272 --> 02:11:45,607
Take that!

1889
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:50,320
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

1890
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:52,072
Goddamn!

1891
02:11:52,405 --> 02:11:53,573
Come on! We gotta move now!

1892
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:56,242
Go, go!

1893
02:12:02,582 --> 02:12:04,626
We got hostiles coming down the street!

1894
02:12:06,336 --> 02:12:07,337
Go!

1895
02:12:12,175 --> 02:12:14,177
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

1896
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:19,933
We're surrounded!

1897
02:12:20,016 --> 02:12:21,142
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

1898
02:12:21,643 --> 02:12:22,685
Rocket!

1899
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,562
Go, go, go!

1900
02:12:24,729 --> 02:12:25,855
Get down!

1901
02:12:28,858 --> 02:12:30,443
This is the perfect place to hide.

1902
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,239
A big glass box!
Nobody will ever find us here! That's...

1903
02:12:37,075 --> 02:12:39,244
You've got to be kidding me.

1904
02:12:39,869 --> 02:12:44,040
Legendary warriors,
the powers that created us

1905
02:12:44,124 --> 02:12:46,876
now want us all extinguished.

1906
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:51,256
We must join forces,
or else forever be their slaves.

1907
02:12:52,799 --> 02:12:55,885
So today you stand with us...

1908
02:12:56,094 --> 02:12:59,889
...or you stand against me.

1909
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:08,731
We'll let Prime figure this one out.

1910
02:13:08,815 --> 02:13:10,024
Very wise.

1911
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:12,735
There's no friggin' way
I'm staying down here with them.

1912
02:13:12,777 --> 02:13:14,028
No way. No way.

1913
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:23,288
Only together can we survive!

1914
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,082
Let me lead you!

1915
02:13:38,094 --> 02:13:39,387
No.

1916
02:13:39,429 --> 02:13:41,681
I was expecting a giant car.

1917
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:43,266
Come here!

1918
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:51,733
We're giving you freedom.

1919
02:14:07,957 --> 02:14:10,668
You defend my family,

1920
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:14,380
or die.

1921
02:14:17,383 --> 02:14:18,968
Autobots,

1922
02:14:19,177 --> 02:14:23,806
we're going to prove who we are
and why we're here!

1923
02:14:25,308 --> 02:14:27,435
You just want to die for the guy.

1924
02:14:27,477 --> 02:14:30,647
That's leadership.
Or brainwashing, or something.

1925
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:34,484
No. That's Optimus Prime.

1926
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:43,326
Autobots, we charge together!

1927
02:14:44,869 --> 02:14:46,412
Now, roll out!

1928
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:51,376
We're getting boxed in!
We're getting flanked everywhere!

1929
02:14:51,834 --> 02:14:53,169
Help me out here!

1930
02:14:53,211 --> 02:14:54,295
Kill anything that moves!

1931
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,298
Come on, Cade, shoot!

1932
02:14:59,008 --> 02:15:00,677
Come and get some, you little bitch!

1933
02:15:00,718 --> 02:15:02,053
Incoming!

1934
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,535
I can't believe
I'm putting my life in your hands.

1935
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:09,839
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

1936
02:15:09,936 --> 02:15:10,996
- Go ahead, take it.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1937
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,164
- Come on, you can lead.
- No, I don't want the gun.

1938
02:15:12,188 --> 02:15:13,564
Then stay under there and shut up!

1939
02:15:13,773 --> 02:15:16,067
All right. You're good with the gun.
So you keep it.

1940
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:22,532
Running out of guns and ammo.

1941
02:15:30,623 --> 02:15:33,293
Come and get some!

1942
02:15:33,543 --> 02:15:36,254
You're all gonna die!

1943
02:15:56,941 --> 02:15:58,443
Way to go, baby!

1944
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:00,903
Good shooting, Cade!

1945
02:16:02,739 --> 02:16:08,453
I'm like a fat ballerina
who takes scalps and slits throats!

1946
02:16:15,585 --> 02:16:17,170
Got your fortune cookie!

1947
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,298
Come here, you little punk.

1948
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:26,929
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!

1949
02:16:27,221 --> 02:16:28,264
Here! Take it. Take it!

1950
02:16:28,306 --> 02:16:29,766
Little help! Little help!

1951
02:16:30,475 --> 02:16:32,036
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it!

1952
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:33,078
What do you want me to do with it?

1953
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:34,937
- Just throw it!
- Give, give, give!

1954
02:16:49,077 --> 02:16:50,620
Got some bad news, Cade.

1955
02:16:50,995 --> 02:16:53,623
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.

1956
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:05,093
Faster! Go!

1957
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,976
I'll kill you!

1958
02:17:43,339 --> 02:17:45,007
Charge!

1959
02:17:56,185 --> 02:17:58,813
No, impossible!

1960
02:17:58,855 --> 02:18:01,149
They're ruining everything!

1961
02:18:02,191 --> 02:18:03,192
Take that!

1962
02:18:10,867 --> 02:18:12,034
Get off me.

1963
02:18:13,703 --> 02:18:15,496
- Get up, Hound!
- I can't go on.

1964
02:18:15,538 --> 02:18:17,123
But you gotta keep fighting!

1965
02:18:17,206 --> 02:18:18,708
Tank's empty, bro.

1966
02:18:19,667 --> 02:18:21,019
There's more of 'em coming.
If you don't get up

1967
02:18:21,043 --> 02:18:22,643
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!

1968
02:18:27,717 --> 02:18:29,218
Attack!

1969
02:18:33,264 --> 02:18:34,932
Optimus is here!

1970
02:18:46,068 --> 02:18:47,737
Bee, jump!

1971
02:20:08,276 --> 02:20:10,152
<i>I hate cheap knockoffs.</i>

1972
02:20:12,321 --> 02:20:13,447
Awesome job!

1973
02:20:13,489 --> 02:20:15,366
- You.
- Who?

1974
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:16,909
- You.
- Step forward.

1975
02:20:17,118 --> 02:20:18,160
Wait. Why?

1976
02:20:18,202 --> 02:20:22,540
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

1977
02:20:22,748 --> 02:20:27,795
All right. I know that you're sensitive
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

1978
02:20:28,004 --> 02:20:29,106
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is

1979
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:30,770
that some things
should never be invented.

1980
02:20:35,344 --> 02:20:36,429
Okay.

1981
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:38,514
We'll lead you out of the city.

1982
02:20:38,598 --> 02:20:41,684
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

1983
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:43,185
Use this car.

1984
02:20:43,394 --> 02:20:44,687
He almost ate me!

1985
02:20:47,648 --> 02:20:48,983
All right, we're good!

1986
02:20:49,567 --> 02:20:50,568
All right, let's go!

1987
02:20:52,737 --> 02:20:53,738
Get out of that seat.

1988
02:20:55,323 --> 02:20:57,158
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

1989
02:20:58,826 --> 02:21:01,537
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

1990
02:21:12,673 --> 02:21:13,716
What did you do?

1991
02:21:13,883 --> 02:21:16,385
I don't know.
I don't know, but it's an issue.

1992
02:21:16,594 --> 02:21:17,863
- Did you press a button?
- Ls it gonna blow up?

1993
02:21:17,887 --> 02:21:18,888
I don't know.

1994
02:21:19,055 --> 02:21:21,283
Your thing is beeping now,
so you must have hit something.

1995
02:21:21,307 --> 02:21:23,017
- Is it gonna blow up?
- I don't know!

1996
02:21:23,142 --> 02:21:25,370
A bomb starts beeping,
that might signal a problem, you think?

1997
02:21:25,394 --> 02:21:28,064
I'm just saying
that it's a steady blinking light,

1998
02:21:28,147 --> 02:21:29,690
which could be a timer of some kind.

1999
02:21:30,733 --> 02:21:32,693
Unless it's signaling location.

2000
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:35,237
To who?

2001
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:45,289
We've got to call the central government
for help!

2002
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:52,838
Optimus Prime.

2003
02:21:54,256 --> 02:21:56,676
Come to me.

2004
02:22:56,485 --> 02:22:57,486
DEFENCE MINISTER...

2005
02:22:57,862 --> 02:22:59,613
...THERE'S A CRISIS IN HONG KONG!

2006
02:23:04,118 --> 02:23:06,478
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROTECT HONG KONG AT ALL COSTS.

2007
02:23:06,829 --> 02:23:08,497
WE HAVE FIGHTER JETS ON THE WAY.

2008
02:23:15,171 --> 02:23:16,172
There's the bridge.

2009
02:23:34,857 --> 02:23:36,066
Back it up! Back it up!

2010
02:23:36,358 --> 02:23:39,904
Go, go, go, go!
Back up! Go back! Go back!

2011
02:23:39,987 --> 02:23:41,507
Move! Get out of the way. I can't see!

2012
02:23:41,572 --> 02:23:43,574
- Shane, drive faster!
- Okay, just calm down.

2013
02:23:56,045 --> 02:23:57,046
Shane, watch out!

2014
02:24:00,883 --> 02:24:02,593
- Get cover!
- Back up! Back! Back up!

2015
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:09,725
Autobots, fall back!

2016
02:24:14,188 --> 02:24:15,999
- Come on, move! Out of my way!
- Get out of the way!

2017
02:24:16,023 --> 02:24:17,703
- Look out!
- Just hit them! Just hit them!

2018
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:38,671
It's a big magnet!

2019
02:24:38,921 --> 02:24:40,589
It's sucking up metal and dropping it!

2020
02:24:47,596 --> 02:24:48,657
- Go faster! Go faster!
- Move!

2021
02:24:48,681 --> 02:24:50,724
- Get out of the way!
- It's coming! It's coming!

2022
02:24:50,766 --> 02:24:52,268
It's coming closer!

2023
02:24:52,601 --> 02:24:54,144
Go faster, Shane!

2024
02:24:56,438 --> 02:24:57,606
Watch out, watch out!

2025
02:24:58,524 --> 02:25:00,192
- Watch out!
- Look out!

2026
02:25:06,115 --> 02:25:09,577
No, now it's circling back towards us!
Hard right! Take a hard right!

2027
02:25:09,994 --> 02:25:11,120
Move it! Get out of the way!

2028
02:25:11,495 --> 02:25:13,873
Oh, my God!

2029
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:30,973
No. No, the magnet. Get out, get out!

2030
02:25:31,307 --> 02:25:33,601
Come on! Come here! Get out!

2031
02:25:35,436 --> 02:25:37,313
No, no, no! No, we're going up.
Grab the bomb!

2032
02:25:37,396 --> 02:25:38,772
Help me grab the bomb!

2033
02:25:38,814 --> 02:25:40,014
I can't get the seat belt off!

2034
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,650
Pull me down! Catch me!

2035
02:25:41,817 --> 02:25:43,319
I'm going up! I'm going up!

2036
02:25:43,485 --> 02:25:44,904
Get me! Grab me!

2037
02:25:46,655 --> 02:25:48,324
Pull me down! Pull me!

2038
02:25:48,407 --> 02:25:49,783
I can't get the seat belt off!

2039
02:25:49,825 --> 02:25:51,410
I can't get the belt off!

2040
02:25:52,494 --> 02:25:53,996
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

2041
02:25:55,164 --> 02:25:56,498
Hold the bomb! I can't hold on!

2042
02:25:57,791 --> 02:25:58,792
Pull!

2043
02:25:59,001 --> 02:26:00,461
Guys, it's crushing me!

2044
02:26:12,514 --> 02:26:13,766
Car!

2045
02:26:14,183 --> 02:26:15,309
Move!

2046
02:26:19,146 --> 02:26:20,147
Shane!

2047
02:26:20,522 --> 02:26:22,274
- Shane!
- I'm good! I'm good.

2048
02:26:22,775 --> 02:26:23,817
I'm good.

2049
02:26:29,907 --> 02:26:30,908
Bumblebee!

2050
02:26:34,078 --> 02:26:35,537
<i>Hey, you GUYS!</i>

2051
02:26:37,539 --> 02:26:38,540
Come on.

2052
02:26:40,042 --> 02:26:41,210
Go find someplace safe.

2053
02:26:41,585 --> 02:26:42,878
I'm proud of you.

2054
02:26:57,267 --> 02:26:58,352
Get cover!

2055
02:27:03,691 --> 02:27:04,775
Cade!

2056
02:27:06,068 --> 02:27:10,406
Autobots, get this bomb over the bridge
and out of the city!

2057
02:27:10,447 --> 02:27:11,490
Dad!

2058
02:27:12,157 --> 02:27:13,617
What? Come on.

2059
02:28:10,299 --> 02:28:12,509
I got it!
I'm getting this bomb out of here!

2060
02:28:12,676 --> 02:28:13,844
Give me the gun.

2061
02:28:14,887 --> 02:28:16,972
It's you and me now!

2062
02:28:23,187 --> 02:28:24,330
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.

2063
02:28:24,354 --> 02:28:25,606
What? You can't help him.

2064
02:28:25,773 --> 02:28:27,253
I have to, Tess. He came back for us.

2065
02:28:27,316 --> 02:28:28,400
Dad, don't leave, please.

2066
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,295
Look, I'll find you, I'll get there, okay?

2067
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:31,570
Dad, no, you'll die!

2068
02:28:31,653 --> 02:28:33,533
You gotta stay with Shane.
You're gonna be okay.

2069
02:28:33,614 --> 02:28:34,758
You promise me
you're gonna keep her safe,

2070
02:28:34,782 --> 02:28:36,992
rest of her life, until the end of time!
Promise me!

2071
02:28:37,159 --> 02:28:38,535
I promise you.

2072
02:28:38,994 --> 02:28:40,472
You're the best thing I ever made, Tess.

2073
02:28:40,496 --> 02:28:42,498
All right, don't ever forget it,
it was always you.

2074
02:28:42,539 --> 02:28:43,999
- I love you.
- Please.

2075
02:28:44,583 --> 02:28:45,876
Get in the car, now.

2076
02:28:46,085 --> 02:28:47,252
Dad!

2077
02:28:56,887 --> 02:28:58,722
Prime!

2078
02:29:24,915 --> 02:29:26,083
Stop the car!

2079
02:29:27,292 --> 02:29:29,211
<i>- You better listen.
- No, you “stem.</i>

2080
02:29:30,546 --> 02:29:32,422
I'm not leaving my dad.

2081
02:29:44,226 --> 02:29:47,896
All right, we're gonna hold the line,
then block the bridge!

2082
02:30:16,675 --> 02:30:18,844
You see, it takes patience
to make a man.

2083
02:30:18,927 --> 02:30:22,431
The patience to watch and wait,
to protect all of us, quietly,

2084
02:30:22,472 --> 02:30:25,267
for God and country,
without any recognition at all!

2085
02:30:30,606 --> 02:30:31,607
Cade!

2086
02:30:32,024 --> 02:30:36,069
There are no good aliens!
Or bad aliens, Yeager.

2087
02:30:36,111 --> 02:30:38,655
It's just us and them.

2088
02:30:38,739 --> 02:30:40,115
And you chose them.

2089
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:47,539
Anytime.

2090
02:30:58,967 --> 02:31:02,346
You saved the human
instead of saving yourself?

2091
02:31:02,429 --> 02:31:04,640
You bring shame upon us all.

2092
02:31:20,072 --> 02:31:22,157
She never listens. Never.

2093
02:31:25,327 --> 02:31:27,496
I gave you an order!

2094
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,011
Get out of here, now!

2095
02:31:43,095 --> 02:31:44,096
Get in. Get in.

2096
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:46,848
Hey, you! Hey!

2097
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,021
Cade, get out of here! This is my fight!

2098
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:59,861
It's my fight, and you're all gonna die!

2099
02:32:08,954 --> 02:32:10,539
GO! GO!

2100
02:32:11,206 --> 02:32:12,207
Come on! Come on!

2101
02:32:18,714 --> 02:32:20,382
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

2102
02:32:38,608 --> 02:32:39,651
Come on.

2103
02:32:47,826 --> 02:32:49,578
Get away, all of you!

2104
02:32:50,537 --> 02:32:52,414
Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.

2105
02:33:00,464 --> 02:33:01,465
Drive!

2106
02:33:04,343 --> 02:33:06,762
You see my face, your life is done!

2107
02:33:06,970 --> 02:33:08,010
Come on, come on, come on!

2108
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:25,614
Yeah!

2109
02:33:27,532 --> 02:33:29,868
Honor to the end.

2110
02:33:31,703 --> 02:33:32,954
You still happy we met?

2111
02:33:38,293 --> 02:33:39,294
Always.

2112
02:33:46,843 --> 02:33:47,844
Hurry!

2113
02:33:49,304 --> 02:33:51,807
Quickly! I'm setting off
Lockdown's grenade!

2114
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:52,891
Hold tight!

2115
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:15,163
We shall meet again, Prime,
for I am reborn.

2116
02:34:30,846 --> 02:34:32,848
Kind of nice being your hero
for a change.

2117
02:34:34,182 --> 02:34:36,685
You always were. All my life.

2118
02:34:38,186 --> 02:34:39,187
I love you.

2119
02:34:40,397 --> 02:34:41,565
I love you, too.

2120
02:34:42,858 --> 02:34:44,234
Let's go home to graduation?

2121
02:34:45,402 --> 02:34:46,403
Yeah.

2122
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,530
You're okay, kid.

2123
02:34:48,697 --> 02:34:51,408
Come here, you're all right.
You're all right.

2124
02:34:55,036 --> 02:34:56,955
We don't have a home, Dad.

2125
02:34:57,038 --> 02:34:58,248
It blew up.

2126
02:35:02,878 --> 02:35:04,963
I might be able to help you with that.

2127
02:35:10,927 --> 02:35:12,345
Brave warriors...

2128
02:35:13,472 --> 02:35:15,056
...you are free!

2129
02:35:16,475 --> 02:35:18,894
I'll ride with you anytime, Spike!

2130
02:35:38,330 --> 02:35:39,831
Did you miss me?

2131
02:35:40,582 --> 02:35:41,750
No.

2132
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:48,590
This Seed belongs to our creators,
whoever they are.

2133
02:35:49,174 --> 02:35:51,551
There remains a price on my head.

2134
02:35:52,469 --> 02:35:55,305
I endanger you all if I stay.

2135
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:59,976
I shall take it
where it can never be found.

2136
02:36:01,561 --> 02:36:03,146
Will we ever see you again?

2137
02:36:03,396 --> 02:36:04,689
Cade Yeager,

2138
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:06,942
I do not know.

2139
02:36:07,442 --> 02:36:10,111
But whenever you look to the stars,

2140
02:36:10,779 --> 02:36:12,989
think of one of them

2141
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:15,784
as my soul.

2142
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:19,996
Defend this family, Autobots,

2143
02:36:21,498 --> 02:36:23,667
as they have you.

2144
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:26,628
Defend

2145
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:29,381
all they can be.

2146
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:41,518
<i>There are mysteries to the universe
we were never meant to solve.</i>

2147
02:36:42,686 --> 02:36:46,690
<i>But who we are and why we are here</i>

2148
02:36:47,566 --> 02:36:49,568
<i>are not among them.</i>

2149
02:36:50,193 --> 02:36:54,239
<i>Those answers we carry inside.</i>

2150
02:36:55,073 --> 02:36:57,742
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

2151
02:36:57,826 --> 02:37:01,288
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

2152
02:37:01,329 --> 02:37:04,165
<i>Leave planet Earth alone.</i>

2153
02:37:05,041 --> 02:37:07,002
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

2154
02:37:07,085 --> 02:37:08,545
<i>for you.</i>

2155
02:37:10,805 --> 02:37:18,145
