1
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:03,876
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:05,677
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,846
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:10,098
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,632
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,217
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,485
But to the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:19,020
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,640
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:23,141
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,193
My name is Amanda Waller,
Mr. Queen.

12
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,445
Welcome
to Hong Kong.

13
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,598
Amanda Waller
wants you working for her.

14
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:33,736
She will have her way.

15
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:35,570
You're Felicity Smoak.
I know a guy who might

16
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,873
be interested in hiring someone
with your expertise.

17
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:38,957
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

18
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,660
Who?
Ray Palmer.

19
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:43,828
What are you
doing here?

20
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:51,920
No! No! Sara!

21
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:53,722
Sara!

22
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:56,725
No! No!

23
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,681
Please!

24
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:10,772
Felicity,
all I'm trying to do

25
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,023
is make things
easier on you.

26
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:13,942
By having me
completely

27
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:16,611
reconfigure
our phone system?

28
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,246
Do you even know
how difficult it is

29
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:21,449
to ping a clone off a hacked
transband multiplex?

30
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,003
No, but only because you
weren't speaking English just now.

31
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:33,345
Sara?

32
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:34,796
I didn't know
where else to take her.

33
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:36,298
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,466
Oh, my God! Oh.

35
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,969
What happened?

36
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,303
I couldn't...

37
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,388
I couldn't
leave her.

38
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:49,561
We have to--
call--we can...

39
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,013
take her
to the hospital!

40
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:59,771
Ollie. Ollie,
it's not fair!

41
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,907
We just got her
back, it's not fair!

42
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,705
Come here...

43
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,675
I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,377
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,215
I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,894
We'll take
our position here.

47
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,645
Who's your target?

48
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,483
I don't have a target--

49
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,234
you do.

50
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:47,319
What?

51
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,987
Might have escaped
your notice,

52
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,906
but Amanda Waller
doesn't have a sense of humor.

53
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,157
Oh, really?

54
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,992
Then why'd she drag
me off of Lian Yu

55
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,377
and bring me all
the way to Hong Kong

56
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,913
to become her hit man?
To become her operative.

57
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,474
Obviously she needs you
for something

58
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:02,178
or she wouldn't be threatening
my family to assure your compliance.

59
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:04,753
The target will be entering
our line any moment.

60
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:16,314
The target will walk 10 paces
through the roof garden

61
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,267
and arrive at his hotel suite.
That's your window.

62
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,902
I see it.

63
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:26,024
Now.

64
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:33,337
Tommy?

65
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:37,361
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 3x02 ♪</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Sara</font>
Original Air Date on October 14, 2014

66
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:43,062
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

67
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:44,876
You know, Sara used
to have a stuffed animal.

68
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,680
It was this old,
worn out shark

69
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,016
that she got
from the Starling Aquarium.

70
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,351
Every time something awful
would happen to her,

71
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:57,305
I would always find her holding
that stupid little shark

72
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,107
close to her chest.

73
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,477
And now that my sister's dead,

74
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,564
again the only thing
that I can think about

75
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,733
is finding that dumb
stuffed animal

76
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:11,286
and putting it in her arms.

77
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:18,210
You have nothing
to apologize for.

79
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,412
Hey, whoever
did this,

80
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:22,130
I'm going
to find them.

81
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,466
We're going to.

82
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,384
When I thought that Sara
died on "The Gambit,"

83
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,836
the only thing
that I could do

84
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,337
was scream at the ocean.

85
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,755
I had so much anger and rage,

86
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,507
and I didn't know
what to do with it.

87
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:33,758
But I do now.

88
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,177
And I'm going
to help you catch

89
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,762
whoever it is that did this.

90
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,318
You're already helping.

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,270
Laurel...

92
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:47,239
You told us
where to look.

93
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,358
I'm just supposed
to sit here and wait?

94
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,494
No. Now you take
care of yourself

95
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:55,447
and your family.

96
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,449
Your father is
going to need you.

97
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,951
Telling him now,
it would kill him.

98
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:04,005
At least now if we wait until
we catch whoever did this,

99
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,041
it'll be easier on him.

100
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:09,044
Ok.

101
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,679
Where are you going?

102
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,181
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

103
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,884
But I know that a bar is the last
place I should be.

104
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,278
Come on, pick up.

105
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,980
You've reached Thea.
Leave a message.

106
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:30,699
Thea, it's Oliver.

107
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,817
Um...

108
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,319
I know you're still
traveling,

109
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,988
but I just,
I could really...

110
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,541
I'd really like
to hear your voice.

111
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:42,327
So please call me back.

112
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:46,965
What'd we get off
the cameras?

113
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,250
Place is
a drug haven.

114
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:49,668
They've all
either been disabled

115
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,670
or paint-balled
by local dealers.

116
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,837
Where are you going?

117
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,890
Where it
happened.

118
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:49,894
Felicity told me.

119
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:55,984
You ok?

120
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,704
Killer stood there,

121
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,489
loose gravel
on the rooftop.

122
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,708
Oliver...
Sara was here.

123
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,627
Scuff marks
back to the edge.

124
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,329
You don't have to do this
right now, man.

125
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:08,663
It's the only thing
that I can do.

126
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,999
Listen, I get it.
Military training.

127
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,709
Stay on task.

128
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,003
Your friend gets shot,
you just keep fighting.

129
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,553
But Oliver...
I'm fine.

130
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:17,589
Well, I'm here
for you just the same.

131
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,891
Listen, Sara was
my friend, too.

132
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:22,427
And if you think you're going after
the person who did this solo,

133
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:24,346
you couldn't possibly
be more wrong.

134
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,855
Yeah?

135
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:35,774
Detective Lance called,
he says it's important.

136
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,359
Do you think
he knows about Sara?

137
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,039
What is it, Detective?

138
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:55,593
You ok? You look like someone peed
in your cornflakes.

139
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,214
That kind of day, huh?

140
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,216
What's going on?

141
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,551
Another archer
in town.

142
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:05,720
Dropping bodies.

143
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:08,690
Seen this guy's work before?
I might have.

144
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,026
You know where
SCPD's finest might find him?

145
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,894
Who's the victim?
John Burke.

146
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,230
Some corporate
financier from Qurac.

147
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:17,065
Seems like he wandered into
the wrong part of town

148
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,900
tonight looking
for a little local "entertainment."

149
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,735
He ended up with an arrow
to the chest.

150
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:25,040
Hey.

151
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,575
You watch your back,
all right? Whoever this guy is...

152
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,494
He's a killer.

153
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:07,438
Her hands are so small.

154
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,992
I never noticed before.

155
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:15,696
She was always so strong
and brave.

156
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:19,299
I always envisioned her
as this sort of

157
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:22,035
Amazonian warrior.

158
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:24,872
Invincible.

159
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,925
Something I could
never be.

160
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,295
I was so jealous.

161
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:42,055
Hi. I know I was
supposed to come into work today.

162
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,607
I--the--I'm sorry.

163
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,976
There's been a death
in the family.

164
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,644
Thank you.

165
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:50,330
You have any idea what other archer
could have done this?

166
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,900
There aren't that many of us.

167
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,818
Maybe 10 that I know of,

168
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,737
and most of them are in
the League of Assassins.

169
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:57,871
Oliver,
you don't think...

170
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:00,324
No. No.

171
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:02,626
They don't
target their own.

172
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,244
What'd you find out?
He hit again.

173
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:06,547
An abandoned warehouse
on the corner of Third and Lemire.

174
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:10,667
Ninth floor. The victim was a construction
foreman, Tim Kaufman.

175
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,336
Security cameras
can't get an angle.

176
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:14,304
Who's that?
Just some low level dealers

177
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,473
that set up shop
in abandoned warehouses.

178
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,008
Doesn't look like
much of an archer to me.

179
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,676
- He might be a witness.
- Where do you want me?

180
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:21,979
Will Lyla give you access
to A.R.G.U.S.'s database?

181
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,681
To find out who did this, Lyla
will give us access to A.R.G.U.S.

182
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,166
I need a list of everyone
on their radar--

183
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,056
assassins and mercenaries
who use a bow.

184
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,171
I'm on it.

185
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,525
What?

186
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,613
Uh, Thea hasn't
called back yet.

187
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:49,089
You didn't
eliminate the target!

188
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,508
That's not a target,
that's my best friend!

189
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,794
Why am I pointing a gun
at my best friend?

190
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,712
Is this
some sort of test?

191
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,464
Yes. One you failed!

192
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,349
Good. Flunk me.

193
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,301
You think it's a coincidence
your friend just happened

194
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,686
to show up in Hong Kong?

195
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,605
He's here looking for you!
What?

196
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:08,475
When you logged into your email,
it set off an account alert.

197
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:10,561
Dead men don't check
their email, Oliver.

198
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,396
Oh, so this is
my fault?

199
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,648
Waller needs you.
She can't let you be compromised

200
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,200
by some rich kid flashing
your picture all over Hong Kong.

201
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,703
Whether you're the one
who pulls the trigger or not,

202
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,372
she wants Tommy Merlyn
off the board.

203
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:37,004
That is a cobalt
encrypted workstation.

204
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,972
You better not be
using it to Tweet.

205
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:42,559
I was--I was,
um, actually just...

206
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:45,812
Accessing an FBI database?
What...

207
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:48,649
Roy, why are you
looking for Thea?

208
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,684
Because I don't think she is where
she says she is.

209
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,853
Why would she lie?

210
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:02,446
Roy, Oliver needs to see this.

211
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,865
No. This is my fault.
He's going to kill me.

212
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,416
What if she's in trouble?
What if she's not?

213
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,118
What if she just
needs space?

214
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,419
She's had five months

215
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,038
and thousands
of miles of space.

216
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,873
Oliver needs to see this.

217
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,677
You need to show it to him.

218
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,300
You have got to be kidding me.

219
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:25,552
What--where
are you going?

220
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,989
There's someone
I need to kill.

221
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,445
Did you do it to make a point?

222
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,532
Because I get it.
Loud and clear.

223
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,534
You are rich.
You are impulsive.

224
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:41,952
And frankly, you are
the creepiest form of stalker

225
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,904
that I have ever
had to deal with,

226
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,289
and believe me when
I'm telling you that that is saying a lot,

227
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,875
And--what are you doing
to our old offices?

228
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,244
Hi. I'll be right back.

229
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,579
You like it? Yeah,
I'm just trying

230
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:53,797
to liven up
the place a bit.

231
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,165
I'm hosting
an event tonight.

232
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,750
A pledge drive of sorts.

233
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,752
Got to make
an impression, right?

234
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,887
Now, what can I do for you?

235
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,757
You can stop.
You can stop sending me flowers,

236
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,392
and you can stop
texting me and calling me

237
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:07,561
and emailing me,
because I spam them, anyway.

238
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:09,329
Oh, is "spam" a verb now?

239
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,932
Because I am never,
ever, ever going to work for you.

240
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,434
Actually, you already do.

241
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:16,687
Only because you
bought the store that I work at!

242
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,538
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did!

243
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,942
My boss just called
and told me that you did.

244
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,444
Well, he's wrong--kind of.

245
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,197
I bought the holding company
which owns and operates

246
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,032
all 20,000 Tech Village stores.

247
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:32,252
But I guess either way,
yes, I am your boss now.

248
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,254
So you can either
work for me here

249
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,289
in a big office
with a big salary,

250
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,458
or...you can work
for me there,

251
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,927
in that awful uniform.

252
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,964
Or...I can quit.

253
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,800
Which is what
I just did.

254
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,269
You know,

255
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,606
most girls would be flattered that
I spent $1.2 billion to hire them.

256
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:55,859
Even if I do have a fairly genius plan
for rebranding the stores.

257
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,195
In case you haven't noticed,
I am not most girls.

258
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:00,480
And I don't
need this. Or you.

259
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:01,898
Or any of this.

260
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,568
Felicity, I--I piss people
off on a daily basis.

261
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,953
It's part of business,
and, well,

262
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,872
being the smartest guy
in any given room.

263
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,625
I own that. So I have enough experience
with people being angry with me

264
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:14,244
to know when they're really angry
at something else.

265
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:17,164
You right now are not
angry at me.

266
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,533
What's your something else?

267
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,886
Oh, money won't
fix this problem.

268
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,838
Money won't solve
most problems.

269
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,923
Not the ones that matter.

270
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,842
But talking helps.

271
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,977
I know we barely
know each other...

272
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:32,562
I'm going
to leave now.

273
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:35,766
Listen, whatever
happened, sorry.

274
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,984
It helps to remember that...

275
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:41,188
It gets better.

276
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:16,807
Someone was murdered here.
Tell me what you saw.

277
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,975
I saw nothing.

278
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:23,230
There was
a black face mask,

279
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:26,566
like a--like
a hockey mask.

280
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:29,035
Now, please, man--

281
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,705
Diggle, are you at A.R.G.U.S.?
I've got something.

282
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,807
Yeah, I'm here.

283
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,877
I got a list of archers
20-long, man.

284
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,245
How many of them
wear masks?

285
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:39,663
Only one.

286
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:43,083
Simon Lacroix.
Mercenary.

287
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,501
Goes by "Komodo."

288
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,169
Send Felicity
everything.

289
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,387
Yep.

290
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,756
Oliver, I'm opening up
the file now.

291
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,091
Is that him?

292
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:52,475
Simon Lacroix. Born in
Saint-Sophie, Quebec.

293
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,594
Raised by a single mom.
Terrible credit score.

294
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,013
Oh, and wanted
for murder in seven countries.

295
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,099
I need his location.
One minute.

296
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,686
Put him on speaker.

297
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:06,106
Ok, indexing all active burner
cell phones within the city limits.

298
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,824
There's got to be
10,000 phones.

299
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,911
Yes, but how many
are making calls to dear old mom

300
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,579
in Saint-Sophie, Quebec?

301
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,664
I got him.
He's on the move.

302
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,565
I found Lacroix.

303
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:49,983
I need to see
what's happening.

304
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,986
Ok. Blowing up
street camera feed.

305
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,055
Come on, Ollie.

306
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,057
Get up.
Oliver?

307
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,059
Are you ok?

308
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,227
Oliver?

309
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,278
He got away.

310
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,394
I had him, Diggle.

311
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:40,896
The way you look,
he almost had you.

312
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,681
Where's Roy?

313
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,932
He's out canvassing.

314
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,984
Tell me about
the driver of the car.

315
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:48,237
His name is Erlich Kelso. He just
got out of Starling General--

316
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,771
and where are we
with Lacroix?

317
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,523
He ditched
his burner.

318
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:52,897
I'm searching the city
for any calls made to Quebec.

319
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,232
We used that to track him once;
He's not going to let it happen again.

320
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,329
All right, so why don't we stop
searching for Lacroix

321
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:58,947
and start searching
for his target?

322
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:00,482
Because there must be a connection
with his victims.

323
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,367
Already on it.

324
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,523
I mean, what if we just--
we go to a local morgue

325
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,927
and we find a body
that looks like Tommy's?

326
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:13,962
At the Hong Kong morgue?

327
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:15,380
You've got a better chance
of winning the lottery

328
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,549
and trying to pay Waller off.

329
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,518
I am not going
to assassinate my best friend,

330
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,805
do you understand?
There has to be another way.

331
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:25,857
There is.

332
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:28,193
But it involves
Amanda Waller

333
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:31,113
finding someone else
to execute your friend.

334
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,034
No, not you, Dad.
Look, I'm already in Hong Kong.

335
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,387
No! No, I didn't tell you
I was taking the jet

336
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,355
because I knew you would
freak out like this.

337
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,542
No, I don't know how long, ok?
It doesn't matter.

338
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:47,930
Listen, if Oliver is still alive,
if he is still here--

339
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:54,336
Look, why don't you just go back
to banging your Pilates instructor, ok?

340
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,510
I'll just be here searching
for my best friend.

341
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,936
I'm sorry, miss.
You can't go in there.

342
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,939
Laurel Lance. I'm with the district
attorney's office.

343
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,440
Erlich Kelso
is a witness

344
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:16,992
of my ongoing
investigation.

345
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:18,694
Mr. Kelso's under
protective custody.

346
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,279
Not from me. And if you have
a problem with that,

347
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,364
you can call
your captain.

348
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,950
Tell him his
daughter says hello.

349
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,007
Who are you?

350
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,442
I work in the DA's office.

351
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,509
I already
told the police,

352
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,128
I don't know
anything.

353
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,965
I still have to ask you
a few questions.

354
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,454
Why isn't this working?
It is.

355
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,305
It's running an NSA
algorithm aggregating

356
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:48,974
the victims' personal
information using

357
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:51,777
every government database
known, and unknown.

358
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,646
Well, it's taking too long.
Sara's killer is still out there,

359
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,448
which means that every minute that
we waste down here--

360
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,734
I know! You don't
need to tell me

361
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:01,069
as if I don't already know.

362
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,705
You're right.

363
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:04,844
And I apologize.

364
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,911
I just need your a game
right now, Felicity.

365
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,544
I don't have it!

366
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:13,215
My friend--our friend--

367
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:15,467
was shot with arrows
and fell off of a rooftop.

368
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:19,054
Her body is upstairs
right above us in a freezer

369
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,840
because we don't know
what to do with it--

370
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,425
with her.

371
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,677
So I am so sorry, Oliver,

372
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,848
if I have feelings, but maybe
if you did, too, we...

373
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,234
Sorry.

374
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:35,771
That was mean. But this is Sara
we're talking about.

375
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,489
Your Sara.

376
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:40,942
How can you stand there
being so cold

377
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:42,994
and rational?

378
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:46,248
'Cause I don't have the luxury
of falling to pieces.

379
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,084
Everyone's looking to me
to handle things,

380
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:51,753
to make the right
decisions.

381
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:54,456
Everyone
is looking to me...

382
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,708
to lead.

383
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,377
If I grieve,

384
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:01,463
nobody else gets to.

385
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:07,302
You're still
a human being, Oliver.

386
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,438
You're allowed to have feelings.

387
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,890
I know sometimes
that it's easier

388
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,308
to live under that hood.

389
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,727
I'm not.

390
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:24,319
Earlier today,
I was looking at Sara,

391
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,038
I realized something.

392
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:32,828
One of these days
it's going to be me.

393
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,746
And this...

394
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:39,751
This life that
I've chosen...

395
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,003
It only ends one way.

396
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:44,222
So that's it?

397
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,674
You're just going
to spend your life

398
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,009
hiding down here
in this cave,

399
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:51,313
waiting to die?
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:53,064
I'm not going
to wait with you,

401
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,684
because if there's one thing that
today has taught me,

402
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,819
is that life is precious.

403
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:03,191
And I want so much more
in mine than this.

404
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:15,954
Let's start
with the obvious.

405
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,340
Why would someone
want to kill you?

406
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:21,009
I have no idea.

407
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,345
This whole thing,
it's insane.

408
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:25,547
Mr. Kelso, despite
what you may have heard,

409
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,716
homicides at the hands
of a stranger

410
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,551
are incredibly rare.

411
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:34,089
Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

412
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:35,473
Yeah, the guy
was a sicko.

413
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,776
And you're a liar.

414
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:40,612
I'm the victim here.
You're also a witness--

415
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:42,898
my witness. And you better
give me something useful,

416
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,116
otherwise you're going to be
facing an obstruction charge.

417
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:46,535
You know, I think I want
to talk to your boss,

418
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,036
because you can't
treat people like this.

419
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,205
Oh, really, you want
to talk to my boss?

420
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:51,873
Ohh!
How's your arm feeling?!

421
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,041
What are you doing?!

422
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,293
John Burke and Tim Kaufman,

423
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:57,078
they were also shot by
with arrows.

424
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,246
And they're too dead
to tell me why.

425
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,965
Can't.

426
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,967
Ohh!
Burke and Kaufman!

427
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:03,752
What do the two of them
have to do with you?

428
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:05,420
We were all
working on a deal!

429
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:08,306
But nobody was supposed
to know about it.

430
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,426
Ohh! Ohh.

431
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:13,311
What kind of deal?

432
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:15,263
To build
an oil pipe line.

433
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:18,350
For Amertek. It's--

434
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,906
You've reached Thea.
Leave a message.

435
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:46,343
Hey, Thea, it's me. Again.

436
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:49,813
And...I don't know
if you're getting these messages,

437
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,615
but I would really
like to talk to you.

438
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:54,067
So please, just...

439
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:56,486
call me back.

440
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,156
Bye.

441
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,911
Lyla has multiple teams trying to get
an angle on Lacroix.

442
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:07,064
Where's Felicity?

443
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:09,132
Hmm.

444
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,834
She needed some air.

445
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,169
And what do you
need, Oliver?

446
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:15,589
I just need Thea
to call me back.

447
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,432
That's not going
to happen.

448
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,321
Why? What do you mean?

449
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:47,537
It was during the siege.

450
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,040
We were going to run away together,
but I couldn't leave

451
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:50,832
without helping you fight.

452
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,856
And when I came back,
she was gone.

453
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,799
I didn't say anything
because this is my fault.

454
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:00,717
She knew I was lying
to her the entire time.

455
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,302
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything about the letter.

456
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,638
I know that
I should have.

457
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,994
Ok.

458
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,404
Felicity, I really
need to talk to you,

459
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:23,323
so please, can you...
Call me back as soon as you get this.

460
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:26,126
Urel! Baby,
are you all right?

461
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,328
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.

462
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,913
Baby, a guy just
got skewered right in front of you.

463
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:31,915
I hope
you're not fine.

464
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,500
And what the hell were you
doing here in the first place?

465
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:35,302
The district attorney's office--

466
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,920
did not send you.

467
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:39,306
You lied to my officers
and now what,

468
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,341
you're just going
to stand there

469
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,727
and you're going
to lie to me?

470
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,429
I needed to talk to him.
It was important.

471
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:48,098
Look, sweetie,
I know you want to help,

472
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,600
but you don't need to take
these kind of risks,

473
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:52,402
you understand?
Pretty sure your sister's

474
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,321
got that covered
for the both of you.

475
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,157
Yeah.

476
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,193
Go home.
We got this.

477
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,412
Ok?

478
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,503
I've got something.
Meet me at Verdant.

479
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,203
Amertek industries.

480
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:13,006
It's an oil company
based in Starling City.

481
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,758
Ok. Now that
I've consolidated

482
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,876
all of Lacroix's
victim's records,

483
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:18,678
I can run the algorithm,
scan the data

484
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,129
and see who received
money from Amertek.

485
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:21,715
How long does that take?
Not long.

486
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:24,717
Three to Kelso, one more to Burke,
two more to Kaufman.

487
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:27,636
All from a subsidiary
from Amertek in Qurac,

488
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,190
which just happens to be the largest
untapped oil field on the planet.

489
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,725
Yeah. Looks like Amertek was trying
to strike an oil deal.

490
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,226
And some paid Lacroix
to stop it.

491
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,695
None of this explains
how Sara was involved.

492
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,364
Sara once told me
she worked in Qurac.

493
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,483
And by "worked," I mean she killed
people for the League.

494
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:41,234
You're saying she might have brought
her work home with her.

495
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,553
Who authorized the payments?

496
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,373
A board member of Amertek
called Tom Westin.

497
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,825
He's Lacroix's next target.
What's his location?

498
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,213
You will not believe
where he's headed.

499
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,840
Where do you think
you're going?

500
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not.

501
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:03,356
Oliver, the only reason why you know
where to find him is because--

502
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:06,208
You were reckless. And Lacroix
almost put an arrow in you.

503
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,765
Let me handle this.

504
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,117
don't you dare tell me
to stay put and think that I'll listen!

505
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,103
You know me better than that.

506
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,772
Sara was trained by some
of the greatest killers in human history.

507
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:20,940
Lacroix put her down.

508
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:22,859
So what do you think
he's going to do to you?

509
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,161
I don't care about anything
except for getting him.

510
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,163
And I will.
You couldn't before!

511
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,115
I won't let him
escape again.

512
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:30,333
I promise.

513
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,196
I won't let him
escape again.

514
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:58,890
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Ray Palmer.

515
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,358
Thank you. Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

516
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,475
Given all that has
befallen this city,

517
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:04,561
it's easy for us to lose hope--

518
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:05,632
to hide in our castles

519
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,632
and be thankful that our
ledges are in the black.

520
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:11,368
Well, we, the city's most affluent
businessmen and women

521
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,653
hold its future in our hands.

522
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:17,240
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

523
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:19,542
I will give away
half of my net worth

524
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,828
to the benefit of our home.

525
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,382
And this will be my salary
for the year.

526
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:29,586
So tonight, I invite you all
to join me in this investment.

527
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:32,973
Not just with your money,
but with your ingenuity,

528
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,392
and most importantly,
your time.

529
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:38,428
The city is my home,
but it's yours, too.

530
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,098
So help make Star City
our future.

531
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:02,762
Let go of the arrow.

532
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,016
I thought
you'd be taller.

533
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,934
It's over.

534
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,937
Lower your bow and live.

535
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,490
We both know
that's not going to happen.

536
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:25,919
Who hired you?!
Who's she?

537
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:27,003
You don't want
to do this.

538
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,922
Yes, I do!

539
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:31,174
Killing him
won't bring her back.

540
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:33,927
I know it won't bring
her back, she's dead!

541
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:35,929
I have stood where
you are right now;

542
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,797
where you're so consumed
with rage you can

543
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,466
hardly breathe,
and you think that

544
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:41,051
taking revenge
will make it better,

545
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:44,020
but Laurel...it won't.

546
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:45,939
It only makes it worse.

547
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,024
No, he murdered Sara!

548
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:49,976
Who's Sara?

549
00:31:49,978 --> 00:31:52,145
My sister, you son of a bitch!

550
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:53,196
Two nights ago,

551
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:56,116
you put an arrow in her chest.

552
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:58,118
Two nights ago

553
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,870
I was drunk
in Bludhaven.

554
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,407
You're lying.
I'm proud of my work.

555
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,576
I wouldn't deny it.

556
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:07,961
Even with a gun in your face?

557
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:09,796
Laurel, you need to stop
and listen to him.

558
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:11,581
No.

559
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,466
No, he killed my sister.

560
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:14,751
Laurel, Sara
wouldn't want--

561
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:16,553
Don't you dare tell me

562
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:18,671
that this isn't what
Sara would have wanted!

563
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,256
Don't you tell me
to think of her,

564
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,891
because I am
thinking of her!

565
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:23,309
Laurel, if you pull
that trigger--

566
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:29,432
You took the bullets
out of the gun!

567
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,402
We have to go.

568
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,086
Lacroix's alibi
checks out.

569
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:48,422
Two murders in
Bludhaven, same MO.

570
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,207
Same night
Sara was killed.

571
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,524
I almost killed Lacroix.

572
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,228
The only thing that
matters is you didn't.

573
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,863
Laurel...

574
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:57,781
the trail's
run cold.

575
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:01,318
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

576
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,737
I will.

577
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:06,407
But I don't know when.

578
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:09,460
Your father
deserves to know.

579
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:23,474
Hey, listen.

580
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:28,012
I got some word on the boy.
Yeah, some stuff's come through.

581
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:30,848
I don't know. Yeah.
It looks pretty good.

582
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:33,232
Lacroix, with an "x."
Yeah. I don't know, the guy's French

583
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,736
or something,
why you asking--

584
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:39,523
Oh, hold on, hold on.
I got to call you back.

585
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:42,493
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?

586
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,765
Hold on.

587
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,784
What is it?

588
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:52,619
Just tell me.
Tell me, what is it?

589
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,955
It's about last night.

590
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:57,257
At the hospital.

591
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:00,494
I lied to you.

592
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,213
And you deserve to know
the truth, and--

593
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:07,301
Sorry, sweetheart.

594
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:11,472
Damn thing goes off every hour
if I don't take my pills.

595
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,641
Laurel, what do you know?
You looked like you were

596
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:16,393
in the middle
of telling me something.

597
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:20,564
I just wanted
to say that...

598
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:23,984
That I'm really sorry.

599
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:25,285
I know that I should
have told you the truth,

600
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,820
I just...

601
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:28,539
I just got to--

602
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,991
Hey, I'm your dad.

603
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,293
I forgive you.

604
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,129
Come here.

605
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:37,915
I always forgive you.

606
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,835
It's all right.

607
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:48,325
She can rest now.

608
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:51,011
She's home.

609
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,617
It's a Jewish custom.

610
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:14,785
I know she wasn't,

611
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:17,337
but it feels right.

612
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,546
Laurel.

613
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:03,834
No, this isn't right.

614
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:05,389
This isn't--

615
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,413
It--she doesn't even
get a fresh grave?

616
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,724
It's so perverse.

617
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:13,644
She deserves a proper burial.

618
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:17,264
She's earned it.

619
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:19,183
No, it's not fair.

620
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:22,653
No one will ever
really know who she was.

621
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,239
Oliver, it's not fair.

622
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:28,025
It's not fair!

623
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:46,677
Laurel, we'll know.

624
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:49,346
I know this doesn't
count for much,

625
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:54,852
but me and Lyla,
we're naming the baby Sara.

626
00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:58,021
We will never forget.

627
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,858
Thank you.

628
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,912
How did I--

629
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:23,547
what the hell
is going on here?

630
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,750
Where am I?

631
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:32,172
Please, please don't--
please don't hurt me.

632
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:35,092
Just--just
let me go, please.

633
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:38,095
I promise, I--I won't
tell anybody about this.

634
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,647
Would a fisherman throw his
prized catch back into the sea?

635
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:44,268
What
are you talking about?

636
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,604
Look, whoever you are,

637
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:49,273
you really don't
want to do this.

638
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:52,492
Do you have any idea who
I am? Who my father is?!

639
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,528
You're Thomas Merlyn.

640
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,664
You've been looking
for Oliver Queen.

641
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,283
How--how do you--
how do you know that?

642
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:02,619
A simple hack of a missing
billionaire's email account.

643
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,705
I knew somebody would come
looking for him,

644
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:07,708
but I thought it would be
his...Mother.

645
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,044
His sister.
But you, the son

646
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:14,047
of the CEO of Merlyn Global.

647
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,382
Jackpot.

648
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:18,552
My friend,
you are going to make me

649
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:20,387
a very rich man.

650
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,439
So Oliver didn't...

651
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,526
He isn't...

652
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,014
Oliver Queen is dead.

653
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:34,151
He's rotting at the bottom
of the ocean.

654
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:37,904
And you will, too,

655
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,657
if your father doesn't
pay that ransom.

656
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,377
I'm in here,
please help! Help!

657
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:45,963
Police! Hong Kong police!

658
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,001
It's ok.
Thank you!

659
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:54,471
You're going home.
You're safe now.

660
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:11,104
I'm going to catch
whoever killed her.

661
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:14,491
I know you are.

662
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:17,611
And until you do,
I'm back on the team.

663
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:21,098
What about
your family?

664
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,666
Sara is family,
Oliver.

665
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:24,584
Just like you,
man.

666
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,590
So now what?

667
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:33,293
Now I got to go get Thea.

668
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:39,549
It's long past time
she came home.

669
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,606
John.

670
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,399
I don't want
to die down here.

671
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,234
So don't, Oliver.

Hey.

Hi.

684
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,228
You changed your mind?

685
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,031
I just decided I want
more out of life.

686
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:53,049
Well done.

687
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,953
Thanks, Dad.
