Is the GCPD incapable
of handling this threat themselves?

I was led to believe

00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,376
an unnamed group
had taken control of my company.

you to meet with us alone.

You tried to kill me.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,154
You were behind Indian Hill.
Hugo Strange was hired by you.

36
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,657
Is that why you're here, Bruce?

37
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,989
To ask questions you
already know the answers to?

38
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,158
Who are you?

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,201
- What do you call yourselves?
- Our name is unimportant.

40
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,996
Now,

41
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,873
you made a threat.

42
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,801
Referring to evidence you'd
uncovered of our existence.

43
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,471
We would like to know what you found.

44

Until now.

46
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,396
A bluff.

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,358
- Nicely played.
- It wasn't just a bluff.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
The more I studied my company's doings,

49
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,076
the more there were things that could
only be explained by your existence.

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,741
Still, I had to know for sure.

51
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,327
- Now I do.
- And what now?

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,334
According to you,
we tried to kill you once.

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,622
I began all this because
I wanted to solve my parents' murder.

54
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,587
Six months ago,
I concluded your organization responsible.

55
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,047
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,515
There are other...

57
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,017

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,473
Such as your own life.

You're here to make a deal.

what they already possess...

I'm not finished.

65
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,370
If I die, my shares will be turned over
to the federal government.

66
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,962
Investigators will comb through
every file, every asset.

67
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,804
Are you prepared for
that kind of scrutiny?

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,712
That would be unfortunate,

70
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
The Wayne name still has meaning.

71
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,187
It's a symbol of light and hope.

72
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,147
For a group such as yours,
that could provide a useful distraction.

73
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,654
You are an impressive young man.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,107
Still,

75
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,697
your offer is not sufficient.

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,455
We will also require that you cease

77
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,959
all investigation into our existence
and your parents' murder.

78

Any violation of that, in the slightest,

79
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,379
and our agreement is void.

I'm happy to hear that.

around in a giant baby carriage.

That's the reason for those drugs
she and the others were stealing.

That's what Peabody said.

305
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,243
I figured that was why Mooney
was trying to find her.

306
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,622
See if she could fix her.

You're sure?

311
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,087
Two separate tests confirmed it.

312
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,469
You remember there was a body
at the pharmaceuticals warehouse,

313
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,386
a worker ID'd as 35 years old
but who looked a hundred?

I remember.

315
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,392
So, Mooney kidnaps Peabody,

316
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,320
and then has one of her
creatures kill her, why?

317
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,106
Did Peabody give her what she wanted?
She no longer needed'?

318
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,820
It seems unlikely.

319
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,702
My bet, Peabody simply couldn't fix her.

320
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,949
Leaving Mooney still searching
for the cure.

321
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,475
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

Hey, Fish. How you doing?

330
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,543
- Not so good.
- Sorry to hear that.

331
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,299
You know, there's a lot of people
out there looking for you.

332
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,801
Yeah.

333
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,553
I need to find that bastard, Strange.

334
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,717
Yeah, well, you know
I can't help you with that.

335
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,260
Aw...

336
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,225
Yes, you can.

337
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,558
And...

338
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,314
You will.

339
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,828
I'll help you find Strange.

340
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,242

344
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,435
Just thirsty.

345
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,601

Okay.

go ahead.

357
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,632
- Why would I need to use the phone?
- Someone's got to be looking for you.

358
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,970
No.

359
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,802
- No one.
- Really?

360
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,516
A beautiful girl like you?

You think I'm beautiful?

362
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,900

363
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,987
Just a girl.

364
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,493
Cops killed my dad.

365
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,995
My mom left.

366
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,365
I was alone.

367

Abandoned.

368
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,953
But then...

369
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,006
Something happened and...

370
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,336
I changed.

371
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,047
Grew.

372
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,390
I'm different...

374
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,392

375
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,727
I'm gonna get rid of that.

376
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,859
I've never been that good
at taking care of things.

377

What are you doing?

378
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,906
Relax. They're just plants.

379
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,196
I'll get those clothes.

380
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:30,248
You don't know that Mooney has him,
or that she's looking for Strange,

381
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,837
and, again, you shouldn't even be here.

382
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,423
Harvey isn't answering his phone.
Nobody knows where he is.

383
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,965
Well, you could start by looking in
every place in Gotham that serves booze.

384
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,554
And we found this...

385
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,303
Beside his car.

386
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,900
She's looking for him.

387
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,528
With Peabody dead,
that'd be her next logical step.

388
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,197
Damn. Damn, damn!

389
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,859
You have to call someone.

Call who? The Feds?

391
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,325
I don't even know which
department has Strange.

392
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,528
But you do know where they're
hiding him, don't you?

393
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,575
You and Bullock both know.

394
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,412
They took him to a place outside the city.

395
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,798
It's like an old mansion,

396
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,210
but on the inside,
it's a high-tech research facility.

397
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,799
The government has scientists
debriefing him, don't they?

398
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,222
They want to know what he
discovered in Indian Hill.

399
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,054
You have to tell us where it is.

400
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,809
The hell I do.

401
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,724
I'll take you there.

402
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,741
Are you sure this is the place?

403
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,278
Yeah. This is where I dropped
Strange off a few months ago.

404
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,452
All right, show time.

- We haven't heard anything.

00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,096
Every first of the month,
people would pay me.

501

Every once in a while, someone would
come up short and they'd say,

"Mooney, I don't have the money.

"Mooney, I need more time."

And they'd cry and cry.

505
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,612
And then I discovered
that when I squeezed them,

506
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,736
and squeezed them,

507
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,652

658
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,774
Well, I, for one,
am personally very glad not to be staring

659
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,861
at those bloody box files and
that flaming bulletin board,

660
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,446
tramping down those
stairs to that dank cave.

It does leave one question
unanswered though,

662
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,035
doesn't it, Master Bruce?

663
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,290
What's that?

664
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,043
Well, you know, with all this
spare time on your hands,

665

how are you gonna fill it?

666
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,466
Well, I imagine you have some ideas.

667
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,921
I do.

668
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,845
Dancing lessons.

669
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,382
Dancing lessons?

670
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,093
That's right. I mean, a man
of your station should be able

671
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,981
to guide gracefully a beautiful young girl
across a dance floor, don't you think?

672
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,857
And I suppose that you're gonna
be teaching me these lessons?

673
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,237
Why, I certainly could. You
know, I was quite well regarded as a...

674
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,943
Bit of a dancer in my day, actually.

675

Were you?

676
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,700
But I think I'll leave
that particular ordeal

677
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,611
to someone more qualified.

You don't quit, do you?

686
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,005
I came by to let you know
that tomorrow's paper

687
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,016
is gonna lay out Bullock's
story of how Fish got away.

688
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,892
How she just vanished
while you two were escaping.

689
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,688
Great. Can't wait to read about it.

690
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,190
And it's a load of crap.

691
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,355
You want to know what I think?

692
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,477
I got the feeling you're
gonna tell me either way.

693
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,318
I think you made a deal with Fish.

694
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,776
You let her escape with Strange
in exchange for Bullock's life.

695
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,827
And how would I manage that?

696
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,122
I saw Penguin get a call
before the riot started.

697
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,540
When the mob attacked,

698
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,925
Barnes ordered all the cops to the front.

699
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:05,464
And that's when Fish slipped
into the woods with Strange.

700
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,884
By that logic, Penguin helped Fish escape.

701
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,530
- Why would he do that?
- 'Cause he wanted Fish all to himself.

702
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,558
I mean, that is what you offered him,
wasn't it?

703
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,354
You promised to help Fish escape,

704
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,236
but you did it by double-crossing her
and delivering her to Penguin.

705
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,861
If that were so,
I'd be a millionaire by now.

706

Except Fish isn't dead.

707
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,072
Penguin would've dragged her
in front of the mob if she was.

708
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,494
So what happened in the woods?

709
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,584
I don't know.

710
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,797
I do know

711
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,384
that you're gonna have a hard
time collecting all that cash.

you did any of this, was it?
