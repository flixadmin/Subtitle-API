1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,838
Hello, my name is Sam Raimi.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:08,259
I'm the director of Spider-Man,
which you paid too much money to see.

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:14,432
With me is my good friend and
co-producer, Grant Curtis.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,729
And I'm Laura Ziskin, and I'm here at
the Sony Studios with Kirsten Dunst.

5
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,941
We're gonna talk about Spider-Man.
We're at Sony, where we spent...

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,737
...most of last year
making the Spider-Man movie.

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,535
Kyle Cooper, who did the titles to the
movie, created this logo for Marvel...

8
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,038
...which has gotten an ovation
in the theaters.

9
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:42,251
The first time we showed the movie,
people clapped for that Marvel logo.

10
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:58,226
We're recording this from ADR <i>2</i>
on the Columbia Pictures lot...

11
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,271
...which is next to the scoring stage.
It's a black box.

12
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:05,316
Do a lot of voice work for pictures.

13
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:09,320
Grant, what are your thoughts
about this opening title sequence?

14
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:15,326
Beautiful title sequence designed by
Kyle Cooper and Imaginary Forces.

15
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,328
Very well done.

16
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:22,625
He worked tirelessly with a great team
of artists creating this. It took months.

17
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,588
Return trips to the editing room, back
into his world, and back to editing room.

18
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:33,177
A lot of artists and technicians spent
a lot of time crafting this sequence.

19
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,472
We didn't want to show
Spider-Man early in the movie...

20
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,975
...because it was his origin story.

21
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,520
But we wanted to give
the audience a taste of him.

22
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:47,358
So we tried to design with Kyle
and his team some sequence...

23
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,027
...that would give the audience...

24
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,115
...the flavor of the character
without actually...

25
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:58,286
...spoiling the big reveal
of Spider-Man before it was due.

26
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,163
I think this is one of the best
title sequences...

27
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,875
...I've ever seen in my entire life,
of any film.

28
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,463
When I first came on the movie,
Sam said the way he likes to work...

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,801
...is to have two editors.
They each work individually.

30
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:20,057
And then he sees both of their cuts and
both of their materials, scene for scene.

31
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,061
And then at the end
of the first cutting process...

32
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,148
...he'll screen the two movies
back to back, the two cuts.

33
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:31,319
Then, in his words, he then
likes to "mush them together."

34
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,695
I can tell.

35
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:37,575
I think it's such a smart idea to have
those two different perspectives.

36
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,706
It's a great honor to have a chance
to make Spider-Man...

37
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:48,419
...and work briefly with Stan Lee.
He's one of my childhood heroes.

38
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:53,341
He created some of the greatest
fiction characters...

39
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,218
...in American comic book history.

40
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,431
That was my favorite day on the set,
when he came by. That was bizarre.

41
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,434
- What was that like?
- It was just...

42
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:08,564
You guys were in watching dailies,
and I waited outside for Stan.

43
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,567
He showed up while you guys
were in dailies.

44
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,944
The whole crew had broken for lunch.

45
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,032
And I just showed Stan around
the Times Square set out in Downey.

46
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,620
And it was very bizarre introducing
the creator of Spider-Man...

47
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:26,707
...to the world of Spider-Man
on the film set.

48
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,710
He just walked around
with a big smile on his face.

49
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,962
He was thoroughly pleased.

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,132
- Was it what he had hoped it would be?
- It was, and more.

51
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,802
I mean, he could tell that...

52
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,098
...everybody was putting 100 percent
effort into making his vision...

53
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,433
...and your vision come through
on screen.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,561
He knew it was being
well taken care of.

55
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:49,939
<i>That's me.</i>

56
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,024
Tell him to stop! Please!

57
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,442
Stop!

58
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,820
Hey! Stop the bus!

59
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,448
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

60
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,660
This was shot in Queens, New York.

61
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:06,455
On the right is my brother
and his family...

62
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:11,168
- ...walking, as cameos.
- That was Ivan? Oh, my gosh.

63
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,463
And little Max and Sophie and Kyle.

64
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:19,343
One of the very first storyboards
that I saw in the movie...

65
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,681
...was the design of the scene
of Peter chasing the bus.

66
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:30,312
And of the sort of, shall we say,
portly young man eating the doughnut.

67
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:34,942
It was really fun to see it
come to life because it's exactly...

68
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:40,197
...as he storyboarded it, brought to life
by these lovely performances...

69
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,993
...and the music and everything.
It's fun.

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,874
I came into the movie
in July of...

71
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,501
What year are we in? 2000.

72
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,505
And Sony had already made
a decision to make the film.

73
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,175
They were in the early stages
of preproduction.

74
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,012
Nobody had been...
The movie hadn't been cast yet...

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,725
...and the script was in a state of flux.
That was when I came on to it.

76
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:13,022
Avi Arad, the executive producer,
has been with it for many years.

77
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,901
And it's sort of folklore now
about how long it's taken...

78
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,238
...to bring Spider-Man to the screen.
I guess 18 years or so...

79
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:25,242
...from when they first made
a decision to try to make the movie.

80
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,580
And we have all sort of only
half-jokingly said...

81
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,666
...it was a good thing
it took this long to get made...

82
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,712
...because the technology
didn't really exist...

83
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:42,676
...to have Spider-Man do the things
that the fans would expect him to do.

84
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:47,389
It was exciting to shoot this
at Columbia University in New York.

85
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,434
The light kept changing
when we were shooting.

86
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,356
Caused tremendous amounts
of problems for Don Burgess...

87
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,441
...and the gaffers, grips.

88
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,902
Willem did a wonderful job
in this picture.

89
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,573
He is both warm and intelligent,
sweet in this scene.

90
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,618
That was necessary
because we really needed Peter...

91
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:12,164
...to look up to the character
of Norman Osborn.

92
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,710
In some ways, Norman was supposed to
be Pete's surrogate father in the piece.

93
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,130
So Willem Dafoe had to have
those qualities.

94
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,676
At the same time, he had to be
incredibly physically adept...

95
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,262
...to be able to ride
that goblin glider...

96
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,390
...in that incredible suit.

97
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,061
It was like riding a mechanical bull
from those bars in the Southwest.

98
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,399
Took an incredible amount
of muscle ability and coordination.

99
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:42,319
The third thing we needed for that actor
to pull this role off...

100
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,658
...was, he had to have a great deal
of menace to threaten Spider-Man.

101
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:51,495
Willem pulled all three
of those qualities together...

102
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,957
...and delivered quite well
in his performance.

103
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,586
This scene inside was,
of course, shot...

104
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:03,007
...months and months
before in a location in Los Angeles.

105
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:08,220
- Right near USC, right?
- Right. In the Natural History Museum.

106
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,518
This was during night shooting. I was
so tired because we worked all night.

107
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:18,856
It was split days. This was probably at 2
in the morning when we were doing this.

108
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,275
It was because of the museum...

109
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:28,532
...and when we could have control of
certain parts of it. We had to be at night.

110
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:32,453
And these were the days
when we had the spider guy.

111
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,998
- Oh, right.
- Steve Kutcher, who was...

112
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,043
- The spider wrangler.
- ...wrangling the spiders.

113
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,252
Let's go.

114
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,590
...Hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

115
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:48,510
I had a great team
of second unit directors...

116
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,181
...who put together a lot
of the pieces of these spiders for me.

117
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,477
Doug Lefter did an excellent job. He was
one of my chief storyboard artists...

118
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,898
...and great second unit directors,
and so was Jeff Lynch.

119
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,317
He shot some of those spiders.

120
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,236
And then we also had John Dykstra...

121
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,699
...who did additional second unit
photography as a director.

122
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,244
Dick Buckley did an excellent
job shooting on this picture.

123
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,247
Delivered some great footage
for that montage...

124
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,416
...of people speaking
about Spider-Man...

125
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,046
...in the second act. He shot a lot
of that stuff. Most of that stuff.

126
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:29,009
Sam was very fixed on what
the spider would look like...

127
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,512
...that would bite Peter.

128
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:37,434
And we were shooting in the winter,
and spiders are summer critters.

129
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:42,523
So the spider wrangler had to go to New
Zealand and Australia to get spiders.

130
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,277
He came in the first day to see us
with this box full of spiders.

131
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,949
And we all sat there slightly repulsed
and slightly mesmerized...

132
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,743
...as he played with his spiders.

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,913
Neil did a beautiful job.

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,291
And his team created things
like this web.

135
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,296
Did a beautiful job out of monofilament
and, I think, a hot glue gun.

136
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:15,264
He worked closely with our special
effects house and John Frazier...

137
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,975
...making all those webs.

138
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,146
I think she's so charming,
along with Tobey, in this scene.

139
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,399
They really give a lot of themselves.
He's so afraid to ask.

140
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,361
He knows it's his chance,
and he can't let it pass him by.

141
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,454
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

142
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,080
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

143
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,583
Where do you want me? Over here?

144
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,126
Yeah, that's great.

145
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,170
Don't make me look ugly.

146
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,422
That's impossible.

147
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,930
Perfect.

148
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,190
- Is that good?
- Great.

149
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,155
That's great.

150
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:19,161
I didn't really know a ton
about Mary Jane.

151
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,790
I had seen more Gwen Stacy,
for some odd reason.

152
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,877
When I first met Sam, I was just
flipping through the comics.

153
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,130
I saw her and I was like,
"All right, I'm blond. Makes sense."

154
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,300
I didn't know a lot about
Mary Jane and Peter's relationship.

155
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,513
But of course I did lots of research
after I got the role.

156
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:43,352
A lot of that is the real spider. A black
widow with a "dress" put over it.

157
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,064
A little shell snapped over the abdomen
of the spider...

158
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:51,527
...so we could paint the shell
without harming the actual spider.

159
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,406
But sometimes that spider is created
with the help of John Dykstra...

160
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:01,245
...and his incredible CGI team
of artists and technicians.

161
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,500
And I thought they did a great job
matching the real spider.

162
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,336
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

163
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,339
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

164
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,424
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

165
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,095
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

166
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,765
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

167
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:27,396
Neil Spisak did a lot of research
on putting together this lab.

168
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:31,233
What his research told him was
these projects come and go...

169
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,778
...so quickly that everything
was gonna be on wheels.

170
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,907
Nothing permanent. Everything
Jerry-rigged and brought in on carts...

171
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,451
...and rolling platforms.

172
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:46,039
I thought that was so unlike what I had
seen in the movies, and so dead on.

173
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,125
...Our entire staff certifies
the product...

174
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,003
- ...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

175
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:56,008
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

176
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,636
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

177
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,639
I'll be frank with you.

178
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,769
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

179
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,647
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

180
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,775
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

181
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,988
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

182
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:22,284
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

183
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,914
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

184
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,334
Gentlemen. Ladies.

185
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:40,844
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voile! There is light.

186
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,183
I love Cliff Robertson.
He's an old-school gentleman.

187
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,605
Great actor, and he's got
a really good soul, that fellow.

188
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,777
He really brought a lot of life
to a part...

189
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,364
...that was just a very simple role.

190
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,117
He infused it with a great deal
of warmth and love...

191
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,536
...and that's what it's all about.

192
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:11,291
He really made me miss him
when he was gone in the story.

193
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,502
Well, let's look in the paper and see.

194
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,381
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

195
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,216
Computer...

196
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:23,178
Computer salesman, computer
engineer, computer analyst.

197
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,099
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

198
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,727
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers,
and besides, I...

199
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,231
This moment when May says to him...
Comforts him.

200
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,401
He realizes in the performance
that she's right here.

201
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,820
Listen. Watch him listen to her.

202
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,907
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

203
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,035
Hi, sweetie. You're just...

204
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,872
He really is in the moment. He takes in
what the other actors say...

205
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,584
...and reacts to it in a realistic way.

206
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,505
Rosemary gives him great stuff
to act off of. She was great.

207
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:04,052
- Did you get some pictures, Peter?
- I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

208
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,055
What's that all about?

209
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,021
We like this scene.

210
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,232
That's the computerized body
on Tobey.

211
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,236
- Don't give away the secrets.
- Same with the buff one. Just joking.

212
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:25,699
We did have the body double
for Tobey when he was skinny.

213
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,286
- Sam will get mad at me for telling this.
- Oh, well.

214
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,955
He didn't think the guy
was skinny enough.

215
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:37,127
- He said, "I want somebody skinnier."
- Then his head would look huge.

216
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,463
Our editor,
Bob Murawski did a great job...

217
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,715
...putting this
dream sequence together.

218
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:47,929
We really didn't have the money left to
do what we wanted to do, so it was cut.

219
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,808
But Bob scrapped together pieces...

220
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,936
...from titles, stock footage...

221
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,983
...that was used in Darkman,
an old picture I worked on with Bob...

222
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:04,071
...and some new graphics and even
a shot from an old Italian horror picture.

223
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,407
- Which shot was that?
- The eyeball with the spider on it.

224
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:13,080
I don't know if it's a Lucio Fulci
picture, or some other film.

225
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,165
But that's where that's from.

226
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,752
Let me reschedule, with a proper
medical staff and a volunteer.

227
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,338
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

228
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:25,258
In two weeks we'll have lost
the contract to Quest...

229
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,679
There's so much going on with
John Frazier's mechanical effects.

230
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:34,267
All the precision timing he's got going
with the computers...

231
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,687
...and this table bed
and the doors shutting.

232
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:43,985
It's really a beautiful work of art he put
together to make all this look so great.

233
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,376
Oh, that's cold.

234
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,501
We really wanted to get
this green gas, but...

235
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,755
Every time we did a test with the green
smoke, it was terribly toxic.

236
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,593
Every combination we used
with mechanical effects.

237
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,680
Finally, at the last minute,
we had to just use the white...

238
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,267
...I think, liquid nitrogen...

239
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:02,522
...and then colorize it. Colorize it
as a postproduction effect.

240
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,941
Norman!

241
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,652
Norman!

242
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,953
Oh, my God.

243
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,915
Oh, my God.

244
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,082
Norman?

245
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,462
That was a hard surface to light
because it has so many angles of glass.

246
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,883
Kept seeing a lot of reflections.

247
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,601
- This scene makes everybody jump.
- Yes.

248
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,978
- It's scary.
- It is scary.

249
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,564
That looks so good.

250
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,485
Great stunt pulled off by
Jeff Habberstad and his guys...

251
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,363
...going through that window.

252
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,574
This was really fun.
This was something we tested...

253
00:17:54,741 --> 00:18:00,622
...early on with this giant pair
of glasses in front of the camera. Yeah.

254
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,629
Basically Tobey had a large pair
of glasses that he would hold up.

255
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,508
And then the cameraman would
rack focus and go back, blurring it...

256
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,845
...as the lenses came into frame
to pull off the illusion of out of focus.

257
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,181
His eyes being out of focus.

258
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:28,525
Now something you maybe don't notice,
but look really closely at his wallpaper.

259
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:34,489
Can you tell what the design is on the
wallpaper? It's little spider webs. Yeah.

260
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,324
I'm fine.

261
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,913
- You can't really tell. But it's there.
- You can't really tell.

262
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,749
Neil Spisak,
who designed the production...

263
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,127
...it's his little secret.

264
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:02,309
This was all done on a set. The entire
house on the Columbia Pictures lot.

265
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,060
This bedroom.

266
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,147
Okay.

267
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,155
Jeff designed that for us.
Our stunt coordinator.

268
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,909
The distance between the rail and the
wall so Tobey could learn that stunt...

269
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,746
...of running along the wall.

270
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,876
Neil did a great job with their house.

271
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:32,213
Every time I see this I think I'm
walking in my grandparents' house.

272
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,092
Neil and his art director
really studied the homes...

273
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,553
...in Queens
where this exterior was shot.

274
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:44,267
And really patterned it precisely
after the interior decors...

275
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:48,897
...and the ad-on front porch made
into an entry hall, all those details.

276
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,775
The cracking plaster...

277
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,488
The mix of wallpaper and paint...

278
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,450
...from different eras
where the front was added on.

279
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,952
Hi, M.J.

280
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,288
Hey, M.J.

281
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,792
I don't know if you realize this,
but we've been neighbors...

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,628
Our prop guy was driving this bus.

283
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,213
Yeah. Martin.

284
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,133
He's a brilliant prop guy, but...

285
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,764
Let's just leave it at that.
I never heard such grinding of gears.

286
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,272
This was actually originally planned
to be a more elaborate scene...

287
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,820
...where he more than just...

288
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,448
Than sticking to the banner.

289
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:44,744
He was then gonna leap
out of the way of a truck.

290
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,624
But we ended up cutting it
both for budgetary and time purposes.

291
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,001
- It's better subtle, though.
- It worked.

292
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,047
It would've been too much
with him jumping the bus too.

293
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,597
Osborn's mansion was also designed
and shot...

294
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,518
...here on the Columbia Pictures lot
in Culver City.

295
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,770
This interior.

296
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,192
Danny Elf man saw this place
and said, "I want to live there."

297
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,697
I thought, "That's the villain's home.
You don't wanna live there."

298
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,825
He loved the design
of this particular room.

299
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,954
In this room you'll see a wide variety
of masks Karen O'Hara...

300
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,499
...our set decorator,
went to great pains to get.

301
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,378
Some are quite valuable,
and they're all quite beautiful.

302
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:39,215
They did a really great job
with the background stuff...

303
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:44,345
...telling the story of his love
of masks and tribal masks.

304
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,184
That's Bill Paxton's dad there.
I love that guy.

305
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,521
- John Paxton.
- He's great. He's in <i>A Simple</i> Plan too.

306
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,318
He argues with Bill about feed,
for the day of the month.

307
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,488
That's right. He's really funny
in that picture.

308
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:13,374
Not CGI, by the way. That little
catch thing. That's all Tobey.

309
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,378
- That's real.
- Which is pretty impressive.

310
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:22,759
And they put sticky glue stuff
to stick his hand to the tray too.

311
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:27,430
- Many takes of those items falling.
- Yeah, yeah, there was.

312
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:31,267
This was actually a scene that...

313
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,938
We had the scene and what
subsequently transpires...

314
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,567
...but the studio had asked us
to actually cut the tray part.

315
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,029
Because we'd originally had two days
scheduled for the scene.

316
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:48,785
And then in the, you know,
the vicissitudes of production...

317
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,538
...we had to cut some time.
They wanted us to cut a day.

318
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,958
So we made it that we would
shoot it in one day.

319
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,962
That part was gonna have to go,
but Sam and I really wanted it.

320
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,382
So we said, "Well, we're gonna
do it anyway."

321
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,927
So we did shoot this scene
in one extremely long day.

322
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,222
Remember how long?
It was, like, a 16-hour day.

323
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,934
- But thank God we did it.
- Because people love that.

324
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:17,313
It's used as a clip whenever
we do publicity. People love that scene.

325
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,818
It's so cute because he's learning
his powers and he saves her.

326
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,945
Parker?

327
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:36,958
This school was also built by Neil on
a stage here at Columbia. I love this set.

328
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,962
This 1952 school hall.

329
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,349
That sequence of the spidey-sense
was something...

330
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,186
...we began designing
actually kind of late.

331
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:01,316
We were in production already. The
shot was one of the last things finished.

332
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,736
It wasn't the absolute last.
The absolute last thing finished...

333
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,821
...was the very last shot of the movie.

334
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,993
Which took 18 months from the time
we started talking about it...

335
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:18,124
It was the last thing that came in.
But this was also... Came in quite late.

336
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:23,338
John composited all these pieces.
Shot the fist. Shot the background.

337
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:28,051
He really did an excellent job
putting these effects together for us.

338
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:36,309
I loved your idea there of showing
Peter's POV while in mid-backstand.

339
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:41,356
- Looking up at M.J. is a great shot.
- You know who... That was...

340
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,860
...Don Burgess' idea:
"Let's pick up a piece...

341
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:49,781
...of Peter's point of view."
I thought that was a great idea.

342
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,661
Joe, who plays Flash,
he was an unconventional choice...

343
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,997
...because he didn't look like
the Flash in the comic book.

344
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,834
But we just liked him.
Thought he had a great quality.

345
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,757
Watching Tobey think on screen.

346
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,594
He's got so much going on.

347
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,727
I love, in that sequence, how he's
coming to realize his powers...

348
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,730
...but he doesn't quite know
what's happening.

349
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,358
But he's kind of secretly thrilled.

350
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,611
Once he finally delivers
that knockout punch...

351
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,034
...he's stunned, and he transitions
into, like, "Oh, yeah."

352
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:39,080
And then this fear starts
to creep over him.

353
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,960
This change is happening to him,
and that sort of overwhelms him...

354
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:48,005
...and the confusion of that drives him
out. He plays it all silently.

355
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,674
Yeah, he's great.

356
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,726
I want more wall-climbing
in the sequel.

357
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,437
- I know. I love this.
- Climbing is the best part.

358
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,439
I get excited every time.

359
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:10,069
Like when Uncle Ben is killed, and he's
hopping and climbing. It's so exciting.

360
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,321
It's hot.

361
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,576
I have a funny story, actually...

362
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:21,164
...about the wall-climbing
that comes later. I'll tell it later.

363
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,094
Tobey was on a treadmill
to do those few runs.

364
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:40,767
This was a really complicated business,
to get this sequence.

365
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:46,189
Isn't it sad? It's so much work and
nobody realizes it, for split seconds.

366
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:51,778
- It's better they don't know.
- But they'll appreciate it on the DVD.

367
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,029
Go, web!

368
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,991
- I love this. This is hilarious.
- This is really cute.

369
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,911
Up, up and away, web.

370
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:06,793
This is Tobey improvising,
with much encouragement from Sam.

371
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,131
Tobey can be so funny.
He's really funny.

372
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,178
He's really a great Peter Parker.
He's really amazing.

373
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,013
Amazing.

374
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,814
This was hard because it was
the first place where we see the webs.

375
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,400
And among the many challenges
of the movie...

376
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,947
...certainly making something
that looks like a web...

377
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:41,410
...that a human-sized Spider-Man
could swing from was a big challenge.

378
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:47,250
And a combination of, obviously,
practical webs and CG.

379
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,920
- This is really funny.
- I know.

380
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,218
I love that the next shot's like,
running home. It's like such a little boy.

381
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,888
Like, "I'm hurt. I'm hurting.
I'm running home."

382
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,770
We painted an image on the wall...

383
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:11,858
...and we'd had various ideas
for what that should be.

384
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,777
Then Neil came up with this notion...

385
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:19,907
...that it's for a talk radio...

386
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:24,245
Drive-time radio show, and it's
the spider on the windshield.

387
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:28,082
- As Kirsten pointed out.
- Well, no, it just came to me.

388
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,752
I was like, "Oh, my God,
it's brilliant."

389
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,963
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

390
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,382
Little known fact:

391
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,220
The woman who plays
Mary Jane's mother is...

392
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,099
...my co-producer
Ian Bryce's wife.

393
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:48,436
She is also an actress
in her own right.

394
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:54,317
She loved wearing those leopard... She
got the sleaziest outfits. I loved it.

395
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,780
This scene was shot at 6 a.m.,
the night before I turned 19.

396
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,826
- On Kirsten's birthday.
- It was on my birthday.

397
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,121
We shot in the morning,
which was your birthday.

398
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:11,250
- And we celebrated.
- I got a cake. But it tasted like...

399
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,086
It was cool.
It was like a breakfast cake.

400
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,466
Like strawberry jam and bagel.
I don't know. It was good.

401
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,177
- We were fighting the sun.
- Yes.

402
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,972
And birds. Listen closely,
you can hear the birds.

403
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,850
- Just on Tobey, though.
- The sunrise birds.

404
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,312
I got to sync mine. You can
see my long underwear in this shot.

405
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,148
And you were wearing
your own coat.

406
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,526
We were gonna shoot the scene
without the coat...

407
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:42,949
...but it was freezing. And that was
your coat that we all loved.

408
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:52,208
I think this scene was shot on
Kirsten's 18th birthday. Is that right?

409
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,378
- I think so.
- I remember there was a big cake.

410
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,215
At the end of the night.
Our last night in New York.

411
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,509
Very cold.

412
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:07,848
It's true. The whole crew had hoods on,
and scarves, gloves and hats, and...

413
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,350
...act...

414
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,019
...on stage.

415
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,646
Really?

416
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:19,151
She does a beautiful job here opening
up a little window of her soul to Peter.

417
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:25,408
Maybe the first time M.J.'s ever
really done that to somebody.

418
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,327
Peter, that was first grade.

419
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,329
Well...

420
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,373
...even SO.

421
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,251
Sometimes...

422
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,753
...you know people.

423
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,589
I remember with a lot of the scenes...

424
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,216
In this case...

425
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:47,013
...Tobey and I had to keep cutting
down the dialogue, cutting it down...

426
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:52,059
...to just find the minimum
that we could say.

427
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,354
Although David Koepp did a great job
writing it.

428
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,359
And then Alvin Sargent did
a beautiful job polishing it.

429
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,362
When we got there, we just realized...

430
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,408
...less had to be said
to make it work.

431
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,456
That garage back there became
your guys' office between takes.

432
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,292
The next-door garage,
the door would come up...

433
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:20,296
...and you guys would work out
of the office. Or out of the garage.

434
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,965
I hunch.

435
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,302
We were racing against the sun
this night, I remember.

436
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:30,973
Mostly because of that last-minute
edit session...

437
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,101
- ...before the performance.
- Yeah.

438
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,607
- Okay, Grant, what kind of car is that?
- It's a Dodge Viper.

439
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,736
Is it really? Not a Viper. I thought
it was a lower-end version.

440
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:47,281
No, it's not a Viper. It's a Dodge...
Great.

441
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,909
Yeah, thank you.

442
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,455
What is that thing?

443
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,794
It's pretty. Our transportation
coordinator, Randy Peters...

444
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,840
...let me drive it home one night
when we had one in Los Angeles.

445
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,350
I think it's a Dodge Prowler.

446
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,853
- Is that it?
- I think you're right.

447
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:27,988
It's a brilliant idea of Stan Lee's
originally to have Peter...

448
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:32,368
...enter a wrestling match where
those colorful costumes are a must...

449
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,870
...to develop the Spider-Man costume.

450
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:39,625
That was a smart way to have him
originally come up with an outfit.

451
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:46,382
This was one of the Marvel artists who
we got to do some of the sketches...

452
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:51,053
...so that the design of the costume
would look like...

453
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:55,724
...the comic book's
for the comic book aficionados.

454
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,896
Jeff Lynch shot a lot of the drawing
of the costume for me.

455
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:06,819
And that artist did a lot of the actual
illustration, like you suggested.

456
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,365
Remember, Kirsten, we had this scene
of you dancing in the window.

457
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,200
That was too provocative.

458
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:17,246
Initially this took place
over a number of days.

459
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,415
So at one point in the scene...

460
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:23,252
...Peter looks out his window
and Mary Jane's dancing.

461
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,921
I was first dancing in my underwear.

462
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,091
- Then in a leopard thong. Not really.
- We covered you up.

463
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,595
Then I wore pajama pants
because it was a little too much.

464
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:37,141
- Now I see the spider webs, kind of.
- See the spider webs?

465
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:41,103
- I love this, when he's lying.
- This is hilarious.

466
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,565
"Okay, thanks." Like such a little boy.
So cute.

467
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,233
- Tobey ad-libbed.
- Cute.

468
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,111
That came out of the scene with her.

469
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,699
- I love that. I love the webs.
- Yeah. That looks cool.

470
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,369
Meanwhile...

471
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,472
Something's bothering him. Maybe
he's too embarrassed to tell me.

472
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,350
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

473
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,144
I just don't know anymore.

474
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,147
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

475
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:28,734
- Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

476
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,653
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

477
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,990
He needs the exercise.
That's a funny line.

478
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,621
There's the car, Sam.

479
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:47,127
It's an 88 Oldsmobile Delta.
1973?

480
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,173
It's a, yeah, 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile.

481
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,676
Kids, it's currently for sale.

482
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,805
If you'd like to own a piece of
the Spider-Man movie, just contact me.

483
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,307
There's a little problem
with the radiator.

484
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,352
But otherwise I would recommend it
to compliment...

485
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:08,023
...any connoisseur's
motion-picture-prop movie collection.

486
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,943
No collection is complete without it.

487
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:14,363
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

488
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,118
Pete, you're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

489
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,328
No, not exactly.

490
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:25,374
Peter, these are the years
when a man changes...

491
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:29,545
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

492
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:32,840
Just be careful who you change into.

493
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:38,887
This guy Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

494
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,390
Cliff made this scene work...

495
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:45,477
...beautifully. It's one of my favorite
scenes in the picture.

496
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:50,733
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

497
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,363
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

498
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,741
Something's different.
I'll figure it out.

499
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:05,331
I kept Cliff up till like 2 in morning the
previous night, recutting this scene.

500
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,083
Trying to make the dialogue play,
rewriting it.

501
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,253
He was exhausted
because it was a 6 a.m. call.

502
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:14,340
So he had three and a half hours
of sleep.

503
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,551
Yeah, he did a great job that night.

504
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:23,515
I love that Danny played the theme here
too. It's such an interesting impulse.

505
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:28,896
He had two themes going,
Peter's theme and Spider-Man's theme.

506
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:34,276
And they would each derive from
the other. But I love that he played...

507
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,904
...that right there.

508
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,873
This was pretty funny.

509
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,755
That's Bone Saw. That's Randy Savage,
and he's, obviously, a wrestler.

510
00:36:55,297 --> 00:37:00,260
And when he came to audition for us,
I just fell in love with his voice.

511
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,555
Like, amazing, that voice.

512
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:12,064
Remember when Randy Savage
met with you for the first time on this?

513
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,608
I can't remember our first meeting.

514
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,027
You were asking him
what type of moves...

515
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,321
...he thought
would be good on-screen.

516
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,200
I'll never forget, he grabbed
Ian Bryce, our producer...

517
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,079
...his head, shoved them between his
legs, demonstrated a pile driver on Ian.

518
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,415
I thought he was gonna kill Ian.

519
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:34,795
Ian's face was turning red,
and Randy just kept working him over.

520
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,672
I felt so sorry for Ian.

521
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,299
There's my buddy, Bruce Campbell.

522
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:42,594
I love the fact that he would
do this for me. Be in this picture.

523
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,305
I only wish I could've punished him
in some way.

524
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,767
The audience enjoys Bruce's
performances in films relative to...

525
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:53,981
...the amount of punishment
he endures in the picture.

526
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:57,443
- Remember that young lady's name?
- Octavia Spencer.

527
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,862
The check-in lady.
Is that who you're asking?

528
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,783
- Yeah, she did a great job.
- She was Francine Maisler's assistant.

529
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,871
Sometimes. She comes in and
helps. She did a really good job for us.

530
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,832
We had footage of those women
beating up that wrestler.

531
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,461
Kicking him in the face and stomach
once he was down.

532
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,298
But we just didn't have time
to incorporate everything in the picture.

533
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:24,636
I love Bruce's Cadillac medallion
that they put on him.

534
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,056
James Acheson gave him. Yes.

535
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,230
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

536
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:39,902
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

537
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,739
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

538
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,658
That's it? That's the best you got?

539
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,411
Bruce is so great.

540
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,250
You probably won't admit to it,
but if you look closely...

541
00:38:55,417 --> 00:39:00,547
...I think I remember who pushed
Spider-Man onto the platform that day.

542
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,425
- I think that's Sam Raimi.
- Just the hand.

543
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,761
I love shoving Spider-Man around.

544
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,764
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

545
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:13,018
That was our PA, Rhys, who shoved
him out, but that was your hand.

546
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,688
I think I remember who was throwing
the popcorn at Tobey here as well.

547
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,732
- How dare you?
- Yeah, well...

548
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,902
You're not as nice
as everybody says.

549
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,112
Somebody's gotta tell
the truth someday.

550
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,242
- It was a pleasure working with you.
- Yeah. Thank you, sir.

551
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,619
Oh, my legs.

552
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,413
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

553
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:38,043
That's something...
That line came from a real story.

554
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,256
Rob Taperd once was driving from
Detroit, and he had just...

555
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,758
My partner, good friend...

556
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:48,053
...and he was going past
an automobile accident...

557
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,099
...and they were pulling some guy out,
and that was what he was screaming:

558
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:55,310
"My legs! Oh, God,
I can't feel my legs."

559
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,980
- As horrible as it was...
- How twisted.

560
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,816
That's why it's in the picture.

561
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:05,404
Really wanted to give Peter Parker
a taste of what was to come.

562
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,490
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

563
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,327
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

564
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:17,165
Mark Andrews, our storyboard artist,
contributed an incredible amount...

565
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:22,087
...to this whole fight scene. A lot
of the ideas in this scene are his...

566
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:27,467
...and it's guided by his brilliance
and his great storyboarding.

567
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,471
- Remember Mark?
- Oh, yeah. Great guy. He's an animal.

568
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:36,602
He could just crank those out.
He had such great ideas too.

569
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,482
A lot of these fighting moves were
developed by Jeff Habberstad...

570
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:48,155
...and others by Chris, our stuntman.

571
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:52,117
Chris Daniels did a lot of great work.
Great spidey-pose reference.

572
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:56,038
He did a lot of homework.
He really knows his Spider-Man poses.

573
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,291
Some of the ideas came
from watching those wrestling videos.

574
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,045
Like beating him up with the chair.

575
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,380
Randy had a lot of input on all this.

576
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,675
Wasn't this one of the first sequences
we filmed...

577
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,011
...with the wrestling arena?

578
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,889
Yes, it was. I remember they had a big
press conference...

579
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,808
- ...and it took place in this arena.
- Yeah.

580
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,894
Right, Ian scheduled it early.

581
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:23,982
We had to film it to make way for the
balcony sequence in Times Square.

582
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,986
It was filmed on the same stage.
We had to film here and get out.

583
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:32,157
All of those guys in the crowd did
an incredible job, all the extras.

584
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:36,495
They put so much energy
into the screaming and the jumping.

585
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:39,581
I could tell they loved Spider-Man.
That's why they were there.

586
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,833
We got a better performances...

587
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,671
...than usual
because they're such fans of the comic.

588
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:50,884
Cash Oshman was the extras casting
director and he did a good job...

589
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,928
...of giving us a lot of great people.

590
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:56,098
A hundred bucks?
The ad said $3000.

591
00:41:56,306 --> 00:42:00,394
I like Neil's set in this room
and the hallway, and the sound job.

592
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,025
They work to tell the story that this is
some subterranean area of the arena.

593
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,112
Which is a hard thing to communicate.

594
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,989
The promoter is played
by Larry Joshua...

595
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,742
...one of my favorite character actors.

596
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:23,291
This is such a pivotal scene, and so
much right out of the comic book...

597
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:28,213
...and something we felt
we had to really do in a way...

598
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,632
- ...that fans would recognize it.
- Right.

599
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:37,264
It's obviously the scene
upon which the whole story turns.

600
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,057
He's got my money!

601
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,892
Thanks.

602
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,646
What the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

603
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,151
Look at the rake to this ceiling.
That's what I was referring to...

604
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,154
...when I mentioned Neil designed this
to seem like...

605
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,073
...it was underneath the stadium.

606
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,242
I love Tobey's face here.

607
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,328
He's a sinner.
He's let pride and anger rule.

608
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,832
You won't see that look
anywhere else in the picture.

609
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:10,088
He's full of himself, feels his own
bitter justice has been served.

610
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,507
The guy deserved it.

611
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:20,140
It's a sin he'll end up paying for
the rest of his life.

612
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,645
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

613
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:31,193
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

614
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,528
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

615
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,325
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

616
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:42,037
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

617
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,622
Uncle Ben?

618
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,833
Cliff Robertson was a real sport
in shooting this.

619
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,128
It's probably 3:00 in the morning,
it was freezing cold...

620
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,006
...and we'd say,
"Get Cliff on the ground."

621
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:56,676
He'd just throw himself right
down on the cold concrete.

622
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,721
No screaming for a furni-pad
or any of that nonsense.

623
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:05,352
He'd throw himself down and
wait for the camera crew to set up.

624
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,938
He's a real professional.

625
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:21,243
It was written originally
that Cliff was already expired...

626
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,829
...when Tobey's character
came up to him.

627
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,916
It was his idea. He said,
"Why don't we just have me alive...

628
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:32,546
...to make contact with Peter
one last time?" It's a great idea.

629
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:40,595
That alley he just ran in was the same
alley that he climbed up the wall in.

630
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,474
We shot one in the day
and this at night, obviously.

631
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,269
Downtown Los Angeles.

632
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,690
- I love this.
- I have a funny story about this.

633
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:57,863
We did a test of CG Spidey
climbing up the wall...

634
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:03,451
...which was a very early iteration
of this scene right here.

635
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,789
I took the test, I called Amy Pascal
and John Calley and I said:

636
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:12,294
"We put Tobey in the suit and we
tested him climbing up.

637
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,630
We put a wall on its side
and tested him climbing up the wall."

638
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,467
We were in pre-production. I was
trying to get more money for the movie.

639
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,597
I called them into the screening room
and they came down and watched it.

640
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,809
It was CG, but I said it was Tobey
in the suit. They went nuts.

641
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,146
They said, "Oh, my God, it's amazing!
He looks so incredible"

642
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,732
Then we laughed.

643
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:39,279
This was a composite of Tobey's real
face put into the CGI Spider-Man.

644
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,531
That was a very tricky move.

645
00:45:56,463 --> 00:46:00,967
I enjoy watching him struggling with
swinging. He's never done it before.

646
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,471
I love the subtlety that you
and John Dykstra put together in here...

647
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:07,182
...of him twisting and turning
on one of these shots...

648
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:11,061
...showing him struggling
with his gift and curse.

649
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,940
Arthur Coburn, was insistent,
one of my editors...

650
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:20,946
...that we had to track his progression,
as far as his development of grace.

651
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,533
He had to be as awkward as possible
in this early sequence to sell it.

652
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,370
- And I thought that was a great idea.
- Yeah, it was.

653
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,506
I shot this sequence
with our second unit...

654
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:42,092
...director of photography,
Chris Faloona.

655
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:49,599
He did a lot of great second unit work
for us. Chris is a garner.

656
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:52,143
So happy to be going with him.

657
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:13,164
This is a beautiful set built by Neil.

658
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:21,673
It's supposed to be the interior
of the abandoned part...

659
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,426
...of the New York
Port Authority Building.

660
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,263
Where the old ferry
used to arrive every day.

661
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,601
Who's there?

662
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,964
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

663
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:07,635
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

664
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,304
Answer me!

665
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:13,975
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

666
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:20,106
- Great moment.
- It's very powerful.

667
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:23,985
Again, this moment
is so much a trigger...

668
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:30,450
...and so integral to what made
the whole story work in the comic book.

669
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:36,081
There's this whole notion that
Spider-Man doesn't ever kill anybody.

670
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:41,169
But he has to be responsible for this
guy's death, so the guy actually trips.

671
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:47,217
But the whole, sort of,
ethic of Spider-Man is...

672
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:51,846
- ...he defends people, but he doesn't...
- Kill them.

673
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:57,310
Even, of course, with the Goblin,
who's responsible for his own death.

674
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:02,315
He just has a lot of good luck
in that way.

675
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,495
This was an image that we loved.

676
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:19,124
Which was also an early image
Sam had...

677
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,877
...of Peter on one of the eagles
in the Chrysler Building.

678
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:27,382
If you know New York, you'll know that
skyline is something that we made up...

679
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:30,218
...which was something we did often
in the movie.

680
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:36,391
We took architecture that we liked and
manipulated it in the CG world.

681
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:42,063
So you know it's New York,
but no street is exactly photo-real.

682
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:47,235
That's why I...
New York has never been shot this way.

683
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,363
It's so inventive and beautiful
and romantic, in a way...

684
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,074
...when he swings through the city.

685
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,414
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

686
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,084
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

687
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:08,673
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

688
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,927
- He's clear, let's go!
- You're confident about this test?

689
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,388
Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

690
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,892
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

691
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,977
This entire sequence...

692
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,939
...starting with that "Quest Aerospace"
stenciled on the crate...

693
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:30,737
...all the way through the explosions of
the bunkers was shot by John Dykstra...

694
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:32,697
...my second unit director.

695
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,700
<i>We are picking up
an unidentified object, closing fast.</i>

696
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:39,829
- Your favorite transition is coming.
- Yeah.

697
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:50,798
- That's really fun.
- It's so cool. I love it.

698
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,050
"Chess!"

699
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,469
Sam just makes this such a great...

700
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:59,474
We have some action, then you come to
the more humanistic things.

701
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:03,144
It's just so great how he balances
all of that out.

702
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,480
The audience is never scared...

703
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:09,734
...because right after comes
a happy thing or sweet thing.

704
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,488
It's just a great mixture of action
to the story line.

705
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,490
It just blends very nicely.

706
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:18,159
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

707
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,869
Yeah.

708
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,081
I don't know if I should tell this.

709
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:28,169
This scene was shot on the Sony lot
in front of the executive building...

710
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:31,839
...because we only had half a day
to shoot the scene...

711
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,759
...so we didn't have time
to go to a location.

712
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:39,389
So we dressed up the front
of the building...

713
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,101
...and wouldn't let the executives
get into their office on that morning.

714
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,980
I love it. Now when I walk
on the Sony lot, it's like:

715
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,775
"That was our school in Spider-Man."
It'll always be there.

716
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:56,030
It makes for a great tour spot
on the Sony tour.

717
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,448
That's true.

718
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:10,378
Can I fix you something?

719
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,963
No, thanks.

720
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,048
- I love Rosemary.
- She's amazing.

721
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,883
Yeah, she's amazing.

722
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:20,138
She's so beautiful, I think.
She's magnificent-looking.

723
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,892
She's funny, because she really didn't
know anything about Spider-Man.

724
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,186
She worked with Sam on The <i>Gift.</i>

725
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:31,065
I knew her through mutual friends
but had never worked with her.

726
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:35,236
She had no idea
what she was getting into.

727
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:38,990
Now she goes places and
she's recognized as Aunt May.

728
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:42,702
- She has a whole new following.
- That's so funny. Fan following, yeah.

729
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,747
- This is a great scene.
- Yeah.

730
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:52,253
I remember right before
the camera rolled, I told Tobey:

731
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,257
"Your name is not gonna be
above the title."

732
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:59,010
I missed him a lot today.

733
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:03,097
I know.

734
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,684
I miss him too.

735
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,772
But he was there.

736
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:19,113
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

737
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:24,369
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

738
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,206
You loved him...

739
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,126
...and he loved you.

740
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:36,631
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

741
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,301
How you were meant for great things.

742
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:43,137
You won't disappoint him.

743
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,291
I love Danny's score right here.

744
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,295
It really takes you into the moment.

745
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,842
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

746
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,262
<i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>

747
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:35,982
That shot was shot with an Earl Wiggins
cam in Downtown L.A...

748
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,359
...with a New York background.

749
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,862
Great shot.

750
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:48,369
Doug Lefter shot this scene for me,
the whole robbery.

751
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:54,041
These snippets were shot by
Dick Buckley, second unit director.

752
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,044
I love that dog.

753
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,839
We called her "the dog walker."

754
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,557
These guys I actually found
on a construction site.

755
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:13,853
We were shooting the scene in front
of the library with Uncle Ben...

756
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:18,191
...and we were trying to get
real faces, great faces.

757
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:22,195
I found these guys
in this construction site.

758
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:26,908
They couldn't believe it. "What do you
mean? We're gonna be in a movie?"

759
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:31,496
It's always better to get real people.

760
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,748
Guy with eight hands.

761
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,918
Lucy Lawless, a friend of Sam's.

762
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:40,087
- This guy I love.
- Yeah, he was funny.

763
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,882
Doesn't he look like Owen Wilson?

764
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,884
- Kind of?
- A little bit.

765
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,056
- He doesn't have Owen's great nose.
- No.

766
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,270
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

767
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:59,607
- I love him. He's so good.
- He's fantastic.

768
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:04,195
J.K. had worked with Sam in The Gift...

769
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:07,907
...and he came to see us in New York
and it was like meeting you.

770
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:12,078
It was like, "This guy has to play
this part." Born to play the part.

771
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,122
Once we got the hair...
It's the thing about hair.

772
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,292
Once we got the hair, he was Jameson.

773
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,712
And Sam's brother's in this scene also.

774
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,969
Like the Delta 88 and Bruce Campbell,
Ted Raimi is in all Sam Raimi movies.

775
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,804
He's hilarious.

776
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,101
- There's Sam's brother.
- There's Ted.

777
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:39,814
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

778
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,232
Every COPY-

779
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,318
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture.

780
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,153
- Conway to page 7.
- That's a problem.

781
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,656
Page eight, give him 10 percent off.
Five percent.

782
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,491
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

783
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:54,453
- He's so good.
- Sam loves to work with him.

784
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,666
It's such a big brother-little brother
relationship. He likes to torture him.

785
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:04,505
He makes him do 12 takes.
He's really kind of sadistic.

786
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,260
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

787
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:17,518
There's a famous New York extra,
radio man, that goes sneaking by there.

788
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:21,939
- Do you remember him?
- Sure do. Radio man. He's a classic.

789
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,360
He was in For Love of the <i>Game</i>
but he found the cutting room floor.

790
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,614
But he did a great job for us
in that one too.

791
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,866
Begging for a job. How about you?

792
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,954
Every time I see these two together,
they make a connection for me.

793
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:41,792
She gives a bit of herself in everything
she does. She's very generous.

794
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,502
I just got off a job.

795
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,256
She's great at playing layers
and levels of things.

796
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:49,842
She's so embarrassed.
Doesn't want Peter to know.

797
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:52,553
I see she's not a very good liar
in this scene.

798
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,681
Excuse me, Miss Watson?

799
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,558
Busted.

800
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:00,019
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

801
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,146
It better not happen no more.

802
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:05,483
Pete even feels worse than she does
about the whole thing.

803
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,568
He's very empathetic.

804
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,530
- There's the button.
- "Try my cream pie."

805
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,494
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

806
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:21,582
- Makes me want to go to New York.
- Yeah. That was a beautiful day too.

807
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:24,377
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

808
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, yeah. Right.

809
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:29,090
I think he'd hate the idea...

810
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:30,841
There's paparazzi guys too.

811
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:34,387
Tobey pisses off the paparazzi guys.
They're nicer to me.

812
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,683
- Do they go away when you tell them?
- They're just, like, nicer to me.

813
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:43,729
The more you act like,
"Don't take my picture," the more...

814
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:47,024
- Just wave and they go away.
- Give them a moment.

815
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:51,696
But Tobey likes messing with them
a little bit more.

816
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,241
They were in his eye line.
They stayed out of mine...

817
00:58:55,408 --> 00:59:00,371
...but throughout his eye line they were
always taking his pictures and stuff.

818
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:04,959
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee someday.

819
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:07,795
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

820
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,255
I won't.

821
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:13,134
I won't tell Harry.

822
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:22,977
I love that location,
it's right across from NYU.

823
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:26,313
It was an amazing apartment,
where the exterior was shot.

824
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,110
- This was a set that Neil designed.
- Yeah, this is an amazing apartment.

825
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:34,488
Where do you get this apartment
in New York? I'd love to live here.

826
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,824
Daddy got it for him. Daddy.

827
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,828
They even have a nice balcony.

828
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,166
I remember when we worked
on this set...

829
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:49,837
...Tobey had a lot of good notes
for myself and Neil Spisak...

830
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:55,301
...about the reality of the size of the
loft that these two would really have.

831
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:58,012
And the style of the furnishings.

832
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:03,392
He had a more realistic take and guided
us from a character point of view...

833
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:06,020
...which is so important
in making a picture...

834
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:11,108
...to listen to actors and believe they
have the best take on who they are...

835
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,446
...and what they know about
their world, to listen to that.

836
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:23,204
See I love this intrigue,
this set up of the triangle.

837
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,456
Sam had said, even early on...

838
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:31,003
<i>"mat he wanted 'Ms 90210 or Melrose
Place... I don't watch those shows.</i>

839
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,338
Very soap Opera-Y-

840
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:37,009
He wanted these, kind of,
teenage relationships...

841
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:43,390
...to be moving in a parallel line
with the superhero story.

842
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:47,686
- I believe it. I see that kind of behavior.
- There's tension.

843
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,397
Yeah. Seems really real to me.

844
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,024
Hello.

845
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,861
Let's go! Move it!

846
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,697
Watch the street!

847
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:05,538
That was me in the suit
during this fight scene.

848
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,791
- That was you? You're very acrobatic.
- You know...

849
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,669
You're multi-talented.
I saw Bring <i>It</i> On.

850
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,921
I know you can do those jumps.

851
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,506
Cheese!

852
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:20,553
Neil Spisak and his team came up
with these pictures.

853
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,514
They're very difficult because
Spider-Man can't be doing any...

854
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:26,600
...of the things in reality
that are needed in these pictures.

855
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,894
We can't do it with an actor.

856
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:32,773
So we had to stage backgrounds
and separate foreground elements...

857
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:37,611
...and do a lot of composites
and then clean up in a digital state.

858
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:42,449
It was a big deal to come up with
those pictures Peter supposedly took.

859
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,202
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

860
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:50,124
There's a slight old-fashioned quality
to the whole film.

861
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,586
It feels like a '50s comic book,
even with what we wear.

862
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,797
I told Jim I really wanted to wear
a trench coat in the film...

863
01:01:56,964 --> 01:02:02,803
...because it signified for me that classic
"girl-in-the-comic-book" kind of look.

864
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,765
I'm pleased about that, that what
we captured looks like a comic book.

865
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:11,020
Yeah, and it has an old-school
feel to it, the movie, a little bit.

866
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:16,317
I was so happy that Elizabeth Banks
took the job of Betty Brant...

867
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,819
...in the reception area here.

868
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,614
With a talented actress like that...

869
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,325
...I was able to have these actors
make a moment...

870
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,411
...when there was really
nothing there.

871
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,749
Bill Nunn did a great job
as Robbie Robertson, as well.

872
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,292
I'm Peter Parker.

873
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,963
I'm a photographer.

874
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:41,300
Yes. I can see that.

875
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,056
He strikes out everywhere.

876
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,518
Yeah, he strikes out, but at
the same time, I see on his face...

877
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:56,482
...that as lame as he is, he's actually
achieved one of his dreams.

878
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:59,652
- So he feels a sense of fulfillment.
- Yeah.

879
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,696
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

880
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:06,033
...costs are down, revenues are up...

881
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,286
Neil designed this set
on the Warner Bros. lot.

882
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:14,500
It's one of his best accomplishments,
it's really beautifully detailed.

883
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,460
He created depressions...

884
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:21,131
...in the walls where
he'd hide these fluorescent tubes.

885
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,469
Quite beautiful, giving it a lot of
dimensionality.

886
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:29,723
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

887
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,309
The deal is off if you come with it.

888
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,896
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

889
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:38,065
You can't do this to me.

890
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,529
I started this company.

891
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,991
You know how much I sacrificed?!

892
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:56,250
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

893
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:00,838
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

894
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,506
I'm sorry.

895
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,634
You're out, Norman.

896
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,228
There's the Goblin theme.

897
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,278
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.</i>

898
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:27,781
What a complicated shot that is there.

899
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:31,535
You've got Downey,
you've got New York background plates.

900
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:35,247
You've got pieces shot
on the stages here at Sony.

901
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:40,669
Very complex. It took us a long time
to design that shot.

902
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:44,590
And a lot of these shots here
in the Times Square sequence.

903
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:50,220
Neil did a great job with Don Burgess
and John Dykstra and his team...

904
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:55,642
...just seamlessly tying
a lot of locations together.

905
01:04:55,809 --> 01:05:00,314
Don Burgess had a difficult job in
shooting all these different elements...

906
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:03,275
- ...to fit together, lighting-wise.
- Yeah.

907
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,696
That is obviously a stage shot here...

908
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:12,910
...but the last shot of Parker
was shot on the streets of Downey.

909
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:18,332
He had a lot of New York photography
and it all had to blend seamlessly.

910
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:24,338
Remember this drama
of trying to find the dress?

911
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:27,174
- I love that dress.
- Yeah, it's good.

912
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:31,345
It makes sense too, because
it's not an expensive dress, you know.

913
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:32,596
Great choice.

914
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,100
M.J., would you do me a favor?
I forgot my drink inside.

915
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,147
I also like that line where he says:

916
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:46,527
"Why didn't you wear the black dress?
My father loves black."

917
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,445
It is a funny line.

918
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:54,701
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

919
01:05:54,868 --> 01:06:00,040
This was, without question, the most
complicated thing we did in the movie.

920
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,543
Even more complicated than the end.

921
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,336
We would have these meetings.

922
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:08,048
We would have these weekly
or bi-weekly, or sometimes daily...

923
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,217
...what we called
"Times Square meetings."

924
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:12,886
Starting from when we made
the decision...

925
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:15,305
...to set this scene in Times Square.

926
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:19,810
The logistics of how to do it
and how to get the shots.

927
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:24,982
The building where you guys are on
the balcony is a building Neil made up.

928
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:29,736
It doesn't really exist in Times Square,
but we had to fit it in geographically.

929
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:34,908
And there were plates that were shot
for this stuff up in the sky.

930
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:39,037
And then there was a gigantic set
built in Downey.

931
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:45,002
So even though
it's a five-minute sequence...

932
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:49,673
...in terms of the resources
and the shooting time...

933
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:55,804
...we probably shot, between the set
and the location, three weeks maybe.

934
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,432
- Close to a month.
- It was a big deal.

935
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:02,728
There was Stan Lee.
There's Stan Lee.

936
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:08,400
- Laura's daughter is coming in soon.
- My daughter. The stuntman who fell...

937
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:11,737
...was a guy who played Spider-Man
on the TV show.

938
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,948
Remember that?
Here we go, Kirsten.

939
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,452
Here starts the screaming match.
Hold your ears.

940
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,037
"Oh, God!"

941
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:23,790
I kept telling Sam...
I love that shot.

942
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:28,462
Girls in movies who scream
really annoy me.

943
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,924
At the end, I got a little annoyed
by my screaming.

944
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,259
At the end of the movie.

945
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:41,808
I love that.
That's one of my favorite things.

946
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:47,981
The pumpkin bomb was kind of fun
because the Goblin was full of...

947
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,567
- There's my daughter.
- Yeah. Hi, Julie.

948
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:54,947
The Goblin has this bag of tricks...

949
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:57,491
...and when we were sitting
and thinking about it:

950
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:02,412
"What would a pumpkin bomb look like?
Who would think of such a thing?"

951
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,501
This kid's stupid. I know he's
in shock, but move, already!

952
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:10,879
Wouldn't your mother go in
and move you?

953
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:14,466
- She couldn't get to him.
- Oh, yeah, whatever.

954
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,010
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

955
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:20,180
Willem demanded to do
all his own fighting.

956
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:25,102
He felt that the character
had to be consistent...

957
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,481
...and that it would show if he
let stuntmen do his work.

958
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,483
It wouldn't sell.

959
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:36,863
Not that the quality would be poor,
but it wouldn't be the same character...

960
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,908
...that he'd created and seen through
from beginning to end.

961
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,912
In this strafing run,
this is him on the glider right there.

962
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:47,332
That's right, that behind shot.
Shot by Max Kleven.

963
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:52,212
It's really a good... Well-designed
glider gag that Max came up with...

964
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:56,717
...hanging off of the camera car,
on a Ubangi on wires.

965
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,885
It worked beautifully.

966
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:09,021
The storyboard artists, mostly Doug
Lefter, did a great job designing all this.

967
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:13,066
He had help from Neil Spisak
and the production department...

968
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,652
...with balloons and the set.

969
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,904
Also,
Jeff Lynch and Dave Stephan...

970
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,699
...contributed a tremendous amount
to this.

971
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:25,412
But my hat's off to Doug.
He's such a great visualist.

972
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,709
This sequence is complicated.

973
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:36,256
Andrew Jimenez really added a lot
with his skills...

974
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:38,342
...working this whole sequence out.

975
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:42,095
Karen Goulekas contributed quite a bit
on the picture.

976
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:47,517
John Dykstra and the animation team
made each and every shot come to life.

977
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,772
But it couldn't have been put together
unless we had Bob Murawski...

978
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:56,777
...who worked the pieces as the editor
and made them all come together.

979
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,155
That was a great swinging shot
by our stuntman.

980
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:05,118
Jeff Habberstad put together this shot
over the blue sky over the ocean...

981
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,288
...because there're no
green screens that big.

982
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:12,542
They shot that out at the ocean.
It's a beautiful swing.

983
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:21,718
Neil Spisak really came up with a
beautifully romantic location here...

984
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:24,638
...for the moment between
Peter and Mary Jane.

985
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:28,517
He did his homework. Many
New Yorkers don't know this exists...

986
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:32,270
...on top of the Rockefeller Center
roof garden.

987
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:36,775
It is such a beautiful place up there,
with the church in the background.

988
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,454
Starting to swing a little better.

989
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:57,671
I love when he swings off and yells.
It's like the high of public service.

990
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:02,426
You've done your best to help others
and that's what he's celebrating.

991
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,344
That's really why it's so effective.

992
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:07,347
And he runs along that building.
I love that moment.

993
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,851
The fellas in the animation department
came up with that.

994
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:14,688
I think it was Anthony,
our animation director.

995
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:17,190
And what do you mean,
incredible?

996
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,362
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

997
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,322
Don't let the bedbugs...

998
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:28,660
Alvin Sargent wrote that scene.
It's one of my favorites.

999
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:32,956
So funny, with James Franco
on the phone with M.J.

1000
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:37,127
You just imagine, obviously,
the other side of the conversation.

1001
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,964
And then, after being dumped on...

1002
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:46,011
...he hangs up the phone and he says,
"She's just a little rattled."

1003
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,055
What else would he be thinking?

1004
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,724
I didn't.

1005
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:57,022
I'm gonna get some rest.

1006
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,525
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

1007
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,361
What was that thing?

1008
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:05,238
I don't know.

1009
01:12:06,698 --> 01:12:10,076
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

1010
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,996
That moment was important to me...

1011
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:19,252
...because it was Peter Parker stepping
up to the responsibility of Spider-Man.

1012
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,636
Somebody there?

1013
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,930
<i>Somebody.</i>

1014
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,766
Who said that?

1015
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:37,062
This sequence with Willem takes you
to depths of the insanity...

1016
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:42,359
...that his character is starting
to plummet down into.

1017
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:46,821
I love the device you came up with...

1018
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:51,034
...with the mirror showing
his two different personalities...

1019
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,787
...and interacting with his
two different personalities.

1020
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:56,540
You know, that was in the script.

1021
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,960
It was all made to work...

1022
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:04,256
...just only through Willem Dafoe's
performance.

1023
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:08,176
Did you think it was coincidence?

1024
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,972
So many good things,
all happening for you.

1025
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:15,809
All for you. Norman.

1026
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,771
What do you want?

1027
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,315
To say what you won't.

1028
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:25,151
To do what you can't.

1029
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,948
To remove those in your way.

1030
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,829
The board members.

1031
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,498
You killed them.

1032
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:40,250
We killed them.

1033
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:41,626
We?

1034
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:45,088
Remember?
Your little accident...

1035
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,924
It's this lesson you learn
all the time...

1036
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:52,596
...about how much you need
to communicate, for the story...

1037
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:57,934
...what's going on, and how much
an actor brings to the storytelling.

1038
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:02,355
Initially written, it was a three
and a half page scene, or something.

1039
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:07,027
And the revelation as we went along
in the process was...

1040
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:10,864
...you could get everything you had
to get from a storytelling standpoint...

1041
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:16,036
...as well as the emotional stuff
that was going on with the character...

1042
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,455
...much more economically.

1043
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:23,043
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

1044
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:26,546
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

1045
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:29,716
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson, Spider...

1046
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:31,551
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

1047
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,556
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

1048
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:39,059
How about "Green Meanie"?

1049
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,062
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

1050
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,564
It is not. I resent that.

1051
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,567
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

1052
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,402
You don't trust anybody.

1053
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:51,655
I trust my barber.

1054
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,990
What are you, his lawyer? Get out.

1055
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:58,912
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

1056
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:08,088
I remember shooting that scene with
the cigar flying back into the window.

1057
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:14,511
Usually it missed the table, sometimes
it landed in J.K.'s lap, burning him.

1058
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:18,431
It's a dangerous scene, to have
that hot thing flying in from behind.

1059
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:20,600
One of my favorites to shoot.

1060
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:22,102
You are useless.

1061
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:26,231
Jane Alexander did such a great job
with his hair.

1062
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:30,026
It's so J. Jonah Jameson. He's great.

1063
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,570
...let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

1064
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,240
Sleep...

1065
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:53,717
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

1066
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:58,304
No, you're not dead yet.

1067
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,640
Just paralyzed...

1068
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,809
...temporarily.

1069
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,896
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

1070
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:09,774
You and I are not so different.

1071
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:13,820
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

1072
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,906
Well, to each his own.

1073
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,993
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

1074
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,331
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

1075
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,793
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

1076
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:32,589
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

1077
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:37,302
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

1078
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,511
Why bother?

1079
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:43,475
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

1080
01:16:43,892 --> 01:16:46,895
There are eight million people
in this city.

1081
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:51,649
This whole notion of trying to see,
at least see the eyes...

1082
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:56,529
...even though we couldn't see
any of Tobey's features...

1083
01:16:56,696 --> 01:17:00,825
The genius of what Sam did
in the end of the movie was find a way...

1084
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:06,206
...to reveal Tobey's face
in the final scenes.

1085
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,375
Because as you can see,
looking at this...

1086
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:15,048
...you're limited in how you can act
behind those masks.

1087
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,717
Or we could destroy.

1088
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:21,888
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

1089
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:26,976
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

1090
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:31,898
Great animation from the fellas at SPI.
I love him leaping on that glider.

1091
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:36,236
He seems like he's gotta balance
himself for a brief moment.

1092
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:41,074
He gotta grab a hold of the front of
the glider to stabilize himself.

1093
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,243
- Seems very real to me.
- Yeah.

1094
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:49,165
<i>In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

1095
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,260
This was also shot
on the Warner Bros. back lot.

1096
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,387
How was your audition?

1097
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:05,098
The sound man gave me
an ugly choice. He said:

1098
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:09,853
"You can have oars in the background,
or you can have your sound."

1099
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,938
Horrible thing to say.

1100
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:18,611
They made so much noise going over
those wet city streets, those cabs.

1101
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,115
Motion picture cabs are always
in terrible shape.

1102
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:26,286
Loud engines, terribly in need
of a tune up.

1103
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:33,543
This is my favorite scene between
the two of them. I really, really enjoy it.

1104
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,880
I'd like a cheeseburger.

1105
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:40,049
Alvin Sargent wrote this.
Did a beautiful job with it too.

1106
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,968
He did a great job.

1107
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:43,595
Come with us.

1108
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,514
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

1109
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:50,935
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

1110
01:18:51,436 --> 01:18:52,937
It's not?

1111
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:56,024
Why so interested?

1112
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:59,402
Avi Arad had a great idea during
this scene.

1113
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:03,656
He said, "Maybe this is the point
where she can finally say 'Tiger."'

1114
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:10,455
Which is what all the fans know is one
of Mary Jane's favorite taglines.

1115
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:12,123
I don't know.

1116
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:16,753
So Kirsten then said, "Why don't I say it
just as I leave, at the very end?"

1117
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:22,050
So together, they satisfied that one
of one thousand fan requirements.

1118
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,928
It's a great little punctuation mark.

1119
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,352
Hey, check it out, man.

1120
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,187
Come on, man.

1121
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,107
This scene was further torturing
of Kirsten...

1122
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:42,695
...in very, very cold weather
and freezing cold water.

1123
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,198
This wasn't a fun scene.

1124
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,825
Although I did like
to do my little butt-kicking.

1125
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,202
You did.

1126
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,374
See, the sidewalks are higher
on the back lot...

1127
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:57,794
...so the water floods in the street.

1128
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:01,130
You're up to water on your ankle.

1129
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:06,678
This was tough because we were
all bundled up in front of heaters...

1130
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:11,683
- ...and you were out there for hours.
- Freezing my booty off.

1131
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:16,396
And trying to be romantic
at the same time.

1132
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:22,902
When we were doing the close-up
dialogue without the looping...

1133
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,489
...I was screaming at him.
I was like, "You're amazing!"

1134
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:31,494
Because we couldn't hear each other
because the rain was so loud.

1135
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:37,583
There was a secret door built
into the side of that wall...

1136
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:42,422
...so that Tobey could escape into it and
the stuntman could then come down.

1137
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:44,674
Although, this is Tobey here.

1138
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:50,263
But the first time you saw Spider-Man
descend was the stuntman.

1139
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,223
Does she know or doesn't she?

1140
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,851
You have that moment
where maybe you know it's him?

1141
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,561
Here? No. That's at the end.

1142
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:00,106
But when he says,
"I was in the neighborhood."

1143
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,401
No? That's what I always think
because he said to you earlier on:

1144
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:04,902
"I was in the neighborhood."

1145
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:09,115
No, I don't think M.J.'s that bright.
Or Kirsten.

1146
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:13,453
No, no, I just...
I wouldn't give anything away there.

1147
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:16,956
There was this wonderful image
in the comic book of him...

1148
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:21,127
...with his, you know,
mask half off like that.

1149
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:25,465
It was something that Sam had
in his head very early on...

1150
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:29,677
...to have this upside-down kiss
which is so...

1151
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:36,392
I know it was painful, but it really
is his signature moment of the movie.

1152
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:41,773
Our mixers, Greg Russell and Kevin
O'Connell did a great job mixing this.

1153
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:45,443
This scene, they handled
just beautifully, like the old movies.

1154
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:49,989
They let the rain all drop away,
brought up Danny Elf man's score.

1155
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,618
They let the audience soar
with the emotion of the thing...

1156
01:21:53,785 --> 01:21:56,829
...pushing away the reality
of the moment.

1157
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:17,850
Let me in! My baby's in there!

1158
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:21,604
This was a great piece
of location work in New York.

1159
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:24,607
I was very impressed
that they let us...

1160
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:29,112
...blaze that building
as large as we needed to.

1161
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,532
We owe a great debt
to the city of New York for that.

1162
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,618
John Fedynich, he was our New York
location manager.

1163
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:41,332
He did a lot of great work securing
the permits and permission to do that.

1164
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:46,045
When he swings into that window,
the one piece of animation I love...

1165
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:50,675
...is when the animator lets his web
get caught in the updraft of the heat.

1166
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:56,639
And it just floats upward in a moment,
right before the cut.

1167
01:22:56,848 --> 01:23:01,352
It really captured
the lightness of the web.

1168
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:11,237
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

1169
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,699
God bless you, Spider-Man.

1170
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,077
The blanket has no dirt
on it or anything.

1171
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,580
Now, come on, you guys.

1172
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:24,083
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

1173
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,503
I'm going.

1174
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:31,591
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back, chief.

1175
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:33,176
Go! GO!

1176
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:44,187
This scene that John Frazier and his
team of fire experts put together...

1177
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:48,191
...I was really impressed by.
The amount of fire.

1178
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:51,736
The fact that they pulled it off
so safely was incredible.

1179
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:53,863
I'm gonna get you out of here!

1180
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,908
Initially, we thought the suits
were flammable.

1181
01:23:57,116 --> 01:24:02,371
We did all of this experimenting
with fire retardant. Scary.

1182
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,457
That's so scary, that...

1183
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:09,212
The action in this sequence
is amazing, I think.

1184
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,963
Like a moth to the flame.

1185
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,342
What about my generous proposal?

1186
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,221
Are you in or are you out?

1187
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,973
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

1188
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:25,269
That's such a cheese line,
but really cute.

1189
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:29,440
"It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind."

1190
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:35,363
That's one of my favorite piece of
animation. The fluidity of movement.

1191
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:38,824
They really captured the awkwardness
of the human form...

1192
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,910
...and its grace at the same time.

1193
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:43,871
I was always impressed by it.

1194
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:47,959
I love the weapons, though.
This was another challenge.

1195
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:51,504
We'd had this notion about
what Sam called "razorbats."

1196
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:58,803
You know, the pumpkin bomb turns into
these flying boomerang-knife things.

1197
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,347
Scary.

1198
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:04,767
Great sound design in here as well.

1199
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:09,272
Steve Flick did a great job in putting
these sounds together...

1200
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,191
...with his team of effects cutters.

1201
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,489
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

1202
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:22,201
He's here.

1203
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,454
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1204
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,041
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

1205
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,336
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

1206
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:35,965
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

1207
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:38,884
Who is this lovely young lady?

1208
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:43,389
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

1209
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:46,225
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1210
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,187
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

1211
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,732
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

1212
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,074
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

1213
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,579
Peter?

1214
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,835
Peter?

1215
01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:18,924
The Spider-Man mask wasn't made
to come off so easily.

1216
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,178
James Acheson had to design one
just for that shot...

1217
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:24,680
...that could be pulled off in an instant.

1218
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,433
He knew it would never hold up
to scrutiny...

1219
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,604
...so he made certain exactly what the
shot would be and designed it for that.

1220
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:36,901
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

1221
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:41,614
- We actually put Tobey up there.
- You did?

1222
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:43,741
You bet.

1223
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:54,210
One of my favorite shots coming up
here. He looks up. He's not there.

1224
01:26:54,460 --> 01:27:00,549
We come back down, he's already
a step ahead of us, furious about it.

1225
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:12,144
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

1226
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,063
Sorry I'm late,
it's a jungle out there.

1227
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:18,150
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

1228
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,445
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

1229
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,155
...and we can say grace.

1230
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,325
Parker.

1231
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:31,288
I remember the turkey in this scene
had been sitting around for two days.

1232
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:35,251
Put off this terrible,
rotting, horrible odor.

1233
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:39,964
People had to pretend that it
was a delicious-looking thing.

1234
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,133
In fact, it was nauseating.

1235
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:46,554
Created an awful stench
that turned your stomach.

1236
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:58,816
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

1237
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:06,991
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1238
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:08,701
Well, let me see.

1239
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,369
Oh, my goodness.

1240
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:13,038
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

1241
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,375
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

1242
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:21,881
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

1243
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,885
How did you say that happened?

1244
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:28,053
Bike messenger.

1245
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,222
Knocked me down.

1246
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:39,231
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

1247
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:43,569
Something has come to my attention.

1248
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:47,406
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, just fine.

1249
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,201
This sequence is
such good moviemaking.

1250
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:53,704
It's so entertaining,
such good, concise storytelling.

1251
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:57,708
It's such a pivotal moment
in the movie...

1252
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:04,006
...where everything comes together
and all the conflicts are...

1253
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:08,010
All the rest of the movie
is set in motion.

1254
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:12,806
Your mother was beautiful too.
They're all beautiful.

1255
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:17,061
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

1256
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:18,521
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1257
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:22,274
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

1258
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:26,278
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1259
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:38,457
In that moment with Mary Jane Watson,
I love where Kirsten is hurt...

1260
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,378
...then she pulls it together
and you see some anger come out.

1261
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,465
And then she decides she's not
gonna take it and she stands up.

1262
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:49,051
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

1263
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:54,682
I love watching her go through
those moments. That thought process.

1264
01:29:56,976 --> 01:30:00,312
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

1265
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,649
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

1266
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,150
I can't.

1267
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,320
<i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>

1268
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,823
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

1269
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:14,326
What do I do?

1270
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:18,622
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

1271
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:21,834
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

1272
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:23,335
Yes?

1273
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,462
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

1274
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:27,673
But how?

1275
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,177
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

1276
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,512
Tell me how!

1277
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:35,848
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

1278
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,184
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

1279
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:44,523
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

1280
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,735
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1281
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:51,822
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

1282
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:56,368
Rosemary was a real sport
to go through this...

1283
01:30:56,535 --> 01:31:00,664
...tremendous physical challenge,
being thrown about that room.

1284
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:05,544
With the fans hitting her hard and all
the debris flying about around her.

1285
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:08,547
I thought the CGI artist
did a great job...

1286
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:11,884
...taking John Frazier's
explosion on set...

1287
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:17,014
...composting it with her, then creating
CG debris elements that flew past her...

1288
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:20,351
...that really put her
in an explosion sandwich...

1289
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:23,062
...and sold the fact
that she was there.

1290
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,396
You have to leave.

1291
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,273
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

1292
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:29,068
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1293
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,406
The thing about the eyes, that scene
was the first day we had the suit...

1294
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:37,660
...and we didn't have eyes
for the mask.

1295
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,912
We'd never seen them.

1296
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:43,874
We were shooting the scene, and we
were literally running back and forth...

1297
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:48,837
...to the truck figuring out
how opaque should they be, how yellow.

1298
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:52,091
And those eyes,
when we first did them...

1299
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:56,762
...to get them to look right on camera,
you couldn't see through them.

1300
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,682
This was originally three shots.

1301
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:02,851
Don Burgess,
when we were shooting it...

1302
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,313
...had the idea to put it all together
as one, which was a good idea.

1303
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:12,194
It was Parker, the hands, the picture,
another angle of Parker, and his aunt.

1304
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:16,949
Maybe it was five or six shots.
He put it all together with one move.

1305
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,451
It turned out to be
the best thing for it...

1306
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:25,124
...because it had a grace in it
that cutting would have broken up.

1307
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:29,628
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

1308
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:32,464
She's been sleeping all day.

1309
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,218
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1310
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:43,308
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

1311
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:47,146
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1312
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:50,357
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

1313
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,985
I haven't called him back.

1314
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,780
The fact is...

1315
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:00,743
- ...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

1316
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:04,747
Alvin Sargent did such a beautiful job
writing this speech by Peter.

1317
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:09,585
It's so heartfelt
and it really gives you a glimpse...

1318
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:13,797
...into the depths of his soul
and his feelings for her.

1319
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,924
Trust me.

1320
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:17,426
It's funny.

1321
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:23,348
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

1322
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,935
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

1323
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:30,105
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

1324
01:33:30,314 --> 01:33:33,525
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

1325
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:37,696
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1326
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,531
I know him a little bit.

1327
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:42,618
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

1328
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:45,954
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

1329
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,706
What'd he say?

1330
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:49,666
I said...

1331
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:55,047
He asked me what I thought about you.

1332
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,175
One of my girlfriends
who saw this scene said:

1333
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:05,140
"This is the speech every girl wants
a boy to make to her."

1334
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:12,064
This is one of the many moments when
what we saw in that room in Berlin...

1335
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:15,984
...is what happened in this scene
that made it worked so great.

1336
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:19,988
- Yeah, Tobey was easy to work off of.
- Yeah.

1337
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:25,327
Everything feels not quite normal.

1338
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:31,500
Both Arthur Coburn and Bob Murawski
did a great job with this picture.

1339
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,878
One of Bob's talents,
which you see in this scene...

1340
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:39,258
...is his sense of performance
and take selections.

1341
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,177
He really has a great talent
to be able...

1342
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,889
...to be able to go in and watch all
the performances again and again...

1343
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:50,269
...and choose what I think
is the best of the best.

1344
01:34:50,561 --> 01:34:54,606
That really plays in the moment...

1345
01:34:54,857 --> 01:34:57,776
...and cut them against each other.

1346
01:34:59,862 --> 01:35:01,989
It's as if you've...

1347
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:05,075
...reached the unreachable.

1348
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:09,246
His style of dress
is another thing entirely.

1349
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:15,043
You said that?

1350
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:18,130
Well, something like that.

1351
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:42,446
That was Harry's first day on the set.

1352
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:45,574
For some reason
he came in with black hair.

1353
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,284
It was the weirdest thing.

1354
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:52,539
We'd already figured out he was gonna
match his hair color to Willem Dafoe's.

1355
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:56,126
He steps in to shoot,
and he's got black hair.

1356
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:04,509
It gets a laugh in the theater,
this scene.

1357
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:07,971
He's like, "Dad? Is that you?"
It's the most ridiculous...

1358
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:12,976
But the laugh altogether
is such a signature of the character.

1359
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:17,272
That's one of my funniest moments
in the picture.

1360
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:21,860
He comes in and hears the rantings
and ravings of his father.

1361
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,862
It's based on, for me...

1362
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:28,617
I would come home and hear my mother
upstairs saying things...

1363
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:34,623
...that she should have said to others,
but didn't have the guts. "Mom?"

1364
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:39,795
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1365
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:46,009
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1366
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,681
I'm so sorry.

1367
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:56,603
I haven't always been there for you,
Havel?

1368
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:00,107
You're busy.

1369
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:02,359
This was filmed in a great location
in L.A.

1370
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:06,363
It was a huge mansion up
in the Hollywood Hills.

1371
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:11,076
That's right. And Neil Spisak demanded
that we not shoot here.

1372
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:15,622
He'd learned that they had shot
a scene from Batman here.

1373
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:20,127
He demanded that I not photograph it
any way similar to Batman.

1374
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:23,422
He made sure to decorate it
a very different way.

1375
01:37:23,672 --> 01:37:26,049
But I don't think anyone knows that.

1376
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:30,846
At least they didn't until this moment,
when you happened to tell the viewers.

1377
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:34,850
Bob came up with the idea
of putting that scare in at that moment.

1378
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,645
- Actually, it may have been Paul's idea.
- Paul Hart, assistant editor.

1379
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:41,690
Paul's idea to put a good scare,
jolt moment in there.

1380
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,860
He did it as a joke.
Like many things...

1381
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:49,781
...I realize some of the assistant's jokes
were better than my editor's great ideas.

1382
01:37:50,032 --> 01:37:52,784
So we took that...

1383
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:56,955
...and Bob transformed it
into a full-fledged scare.

1384
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:01,293
You were supposed to be asleep.

1385
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:06,923
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1386
01:38:07,132 --> 01:38:11,136
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1387
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,930
This was a great scene
that David Koepp wrote.

1388
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:17,559
Reminds us of Peter's warmth
for Mary Jane ever since he was a child.

1389
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,729
Helps set up the ending of the piece.

1390
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,273
When he finally walks away from her.

1391
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,443
You're reminded
just how much she means to him.

1392
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:30,739
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1393
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:35,494
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1394
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:38,830
You're so mysterious all the time.

1395
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:41,833
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1396
01:38:42,084 --> 01:38:46,004
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1397
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:48,924
Everybody else knows.

1398
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:53,136
I'll be right back.

1399
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,138
But...

1400
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,481
Come on, pick up.

1401
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:07,943
<i>- Hey, M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1402
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,029
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1403
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:14,157
Hello? You there?

1404
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:19,162
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1405
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,747
All right, well...

1406
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,207
Don't...

1407
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:25,210
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1408
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:26,378
Hello?

1409
01:39:26,545 --> 01:39:28,463
That laugh.

1410
01:39:30,507 --> 01:39:32,843
Such a great cackle.

1411
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:35,554
Where is she?

1412
01:39:40,392 --> 01:39:44,771
We actually played around with a lot
of different locations for this ending.

1413
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,566
We knew we wanted to be up high.

1414
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:53,822
That seemed like a requirement of the
storytelling. The Goblin who flies...

1415
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:58,160
...and Spider-Man who swings,
and all that.

1416
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:03,081
Then it hit us that
the 59th Street Bridge was the place.

1417
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:07,502
Little did we know how difficult
it would be to execute.

1418
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,213
Like the Times Square sequence...

1419
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:15,177
...we couldn't actually go up there
and shoot on top of that bridge.

1420
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:20,807
When we screened the movie
for the studio for the first time...

1421
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:26,271
...they watched a sequence of M.J. on
the bridge, but there was no bridge.

1422
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,607
And Spider-Man rescued her...

1423
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:32,027
...but for half of the sequence,
there was no Spider-Man.

1424
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:36,406
And we were trying to say:
"No, no, trust us. It's gonna be okay."

1425
01:40:48,919 --> 01:40:50,629
Goblin, what have you done?

1426
01:40:55,425 --> 01:41:00,055
I read about 400 kids
for those 10 kids in the tram.

1427
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:04,601
I know you did. You were
in the casting room with them forever.

1428
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,937
I spent about four days...

1429
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,315
...with 9-year-olds screaming
at me and crying for me.

1430
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:13,401
It was painful.
But they all did a great job...

1431
01:41:13,652 --> 01:41:18,782
...and it's really tough. They go
through a lot of emotions there.

1432
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:34,256
Spider-Man!

1433
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:39,010
For all the amount of hanging and
dropping I did, it doesn't look painful.

1434
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:42,180
- It doesn't? It looks like that to me.
- Really? I did a lot?

1435
01:41:42,514 --> 01:41:46,309
But I was up there
for two weeks straight doing stuff.

1436
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:49,312
Yeah, you were hanging and falling,
hanging and falling.

1437
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:52,607
When you auditioned, Sam said:

1438
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:55,318
"Are you in good shape?"
You made a muscle.

1439
01:41:55,527 --> 01:42:00,282
- You don't have a lot of muscle.
- I don't have any. I'm like, "Yeah, Sam.

1440
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,201
Sure, whatever you want."

1441
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:08,206
This bridge sequence is one of
the hardest scenes that I've ever done.

1442
01:42:08,415 --> 01:42:11,376
To think about how
the real bridge worked...

1443
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:14,879
...and blocking the characters
on the real structure...

1444
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:19,050
...verses the set pieces Neil
and his team built on stages...

1445
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:22,220
...verses the CGI bridge
that had to be made...

1446
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,139
...and the cheats that had to be made...

1447
01:42:24,306 --> 01:42:26,558
...relative to the real bridge
and the set pieces.

1448
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:32,564
The under-bridge sets that went with
it. There was so much to keep in mind.

1449
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:37,569
- It got very difficult, I remember.
- More so than Times Square sequence?

1450
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:41,072
For me, it was, because I couldn't
walk the bridge.

1451
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:46,202
These places didn't exist so that you
could scout and know personally.

1452
01:42:46,453 --> 01:42:50,915
A lot of it had to be kept in the mind
or just done through photographs.

1453
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:55,045
So much dimensionality to it.
People moving from point A to point B.

1454
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,881
I don't just mean left and right
or backwards and forward...

1455
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,257
...but up and down.

1456
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:01,760
Under, over, around the bridge.

1457
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:05,055
You have to have a sense of it
in your mind to make the scene work.

1458
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:07,390
So it was a real brain twister.

1459
01:43:07,557 --> 01:43:10,560
And always trying to keep in mind
where you are geographically...

1460
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:13,730
...compared to Manhattan
and Roosevelt Island...

1461
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,982
...to keep the continuity correct.

1462
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:18,068
That's right.

1463
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,823
Dan Sweetman,
a great storyboard artist...

1464
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:29,287
...came in the second half of editing
and helped me re-work this sequence...

1465
01:43:29,496 --> 01:43:32,916
...based on original work that
Jeff Lynch, storyboard artist, had done.

1466
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:36,002
Actually, before that,
based on work that I'd done...

1467
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:39,798
...with another storyboard artist,
Mark Andrews.

1468
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:43,301
Everybody really contributed
to this sequence.

1469
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:47,013
Along with all the people
at Sony Pictures Imageworks.

1470
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:51,226
Contributed incredible amount
under John Dykstra's supervision.

1471
01:43:56,648 --> 01:44:00,402
That's some more great animation
right there.

1472
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,326
What's the groaning cow there?

1473
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,621
That's the sound of strain on the...

1474
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,458
Slowed down to 72 frames a second...

1475
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:20,171
...the sound of thousands of pounds
of torque on this steel cable.

1476
01:44:22,424 --> 01:44:25,844
Tobey's brothers are in the tram too,
one of them was.

1477
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:29,347
And John Dykstra,
visual effects supervisor...

1478
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:32,183
...his daughter was one
of the tram kids.

1479
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:38,773
John (Sally's stepson is one of the
tram kids. Everybody got in the act.

1480
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:41,359
I got something for your ass!

1481
01:44:41,526 --> 01:44:43,319
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1482
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:46,448
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

1483
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:48,867
Took a long time to reset
and do those shots.

1484
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:53,455
All the prop guys and crew members
running around picking up rubber pipes.

1485
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:55,373
A rubber chicken
was slipped in there.

1486
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:58,501
But it took a long time
to reload all the New Yorkers...

1487
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:02,338
- ...with objects to pelt Willem with.
- Yeah.

1488
01:45:02,547 --> 01:45:08,803
It's tough. You've got 150 extras that
you've treated badly for two days...

1489
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:13,558
...then you give them objects to throw
at you. It's a dangerous job.

1490
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:21,107
This was a set constructed
by Neil and his team...

1491
01:45:21,316 --> 01:45:24,611
...that we referred to
as the "hulking ruin."

1492
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:28,615
A lot of beautiful
design work done in here.

1493
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:37,499
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1494
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:41,586
And this, to a large degree,
actually exists.

1495
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:46,257
It's an old abandoned
smallpox hospital on Roosevelt Island.

1496
01:45:46,508 --> 01:45:48,676
But Neil did take his cue...

1497
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:52,472
...from the actual hospital
that's there. It's interesting.

1498
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:59,854
I thought the mixers did
a beautiful job in here.

1499
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:08,821
Tobey did a great job looping too.

1500
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:11,282
He had to come up
with 16 different ways to grunt.

1501
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:12,575
Yeah, he did.

1502
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:21,793
Peter Menzies came up with the web...

1503
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:25,380
...Peter uses to stop the Goblin
the last second.

1504
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:30,760
He was my second unit director
of photography just for this sequence.

1505
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,809
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1506
01:46:37,976 --> 01:46:41,312
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1507
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,147
...would have been quick
and painless.

1508
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:46,776
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1509
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:51,906
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1510
01:46:56,828 --> 01:46:59,789
Sam came in one day and said,
"I want him to have a trident."

1511
01:46:59,998 --> 01:47:02,625
I don't know where that came from.

1512
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,837
- With electric prods on the end.
- Right.

1513
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:10,842
Get him, Spidey.
Your will is stronger than his.

1514
01:47:11,843 --> 01:47:13,761
Kick his buttocks.

1515
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:23,855
Kim Kahana did great stunt here.
We let this wall fall down on him.

1516
01:47:27,692 --> 01:47:33,114
Willem did do almost all of his own
stunts, but that one was done by Kim.

1517
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:39,662
Sam, I'm curious, is that arm coming out
of the rubble a wink to <i>Evil Dead?</i>

1518
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:43,875
No, it's just a tribute to those old
Universal horror pictures.

1519
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:53,384
The monster awakens.

1520
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,555
The guys at A.D.I.,
Amalgamated Dynamics...

1521
01:47:57,764 --> 01:48:02,060
...did a great job with Willem's mask
right there, letting us beat it up.

1522
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:05,021
- They really did.
- Yeah.

1523
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,069
Mr. Osborn.

1524
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:12,737
Thank God for you.

1525
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:16,699
Great work on Spider-Man's costume
in various stages.

1526
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:21,829
We had meetings about getting him
to the stage where you see him here.

1527
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:27,210
And a lot of great work done
by Jim Acheson and Lisa Tomczeszyn...

1528
01:48:27,418 --> 01:48:31,589
...and his team of artists over there
in costume shop.

1529
01:48:31,798 --> 01:48:36,844
Jim had a mockup of the Spider-Man
outfit on a dummy he kept in a truck.

1530
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:39,222
He'd follow me around,
location to location...

1531
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:43,184
...lifting the truck's tailgate, saying:
"How about this, Sam?"

1532
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:47,021
He'd take a razorblade to it and slice
away more pieces and more pieces.

1533
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:50,108
He really worked long
and hard on that.

1534
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,237
- The battle-ravaged Spider-Man look.
- Yeah.

1535
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:00,910
It was difficult because
the whole costume works on tension...

1536
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:04,247
...as Jim painstakingly told me
again and again.

1537
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:09,460
You could only remove certain pieces
and still have it hold together properly.

1538
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:14,966
Yeah, for the rain sequence,
you had to ruin one of our costumes...

1539
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:20,471
...to make the head removable
and peeled up like that, and build...

1540
01:49:21,139 --> 01:49:22,974
...a special helmet.

1541
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:27,979
This shot of Willem coming up
was actually shot later. This one.

1542
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:31,482
He was already on another show.
He had to wear a wig.

1543
01:49:31,733 --> 01:49:35,611
He's more like the David Bowie
of Green Goblins.

1544
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:37,864
Don't tell Harry.

1545
01:49:44,996 --> 01:49:48,458
The reason we re-did that shot
because we wanted him to say:

1546
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:50,501
- "Don't tell Harry."
- Yeah.

1547
01:49:50,752 --> 01:49:55,590
Rather than it being an act of kindness
that Peter performs not tell Harry...

1548
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:00,344
...we wanted him to fulfill
the last wish of Norman Osborn...

1549
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:04,515
...this man who had been
the surrogate father to him.

1550
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:10,271
So that he'd have an obligation,
a friendship...

1551
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:15,359
...to perform these last acts,
to keep this dark secret.

1552
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:31,834
Remember?
This was our first day in New York.

1553
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:35,046
It was so cold and so windy.

1554
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:40,384
Again, we had one day to shoot
this critical end scene in the movie.

1555
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:43,805
But it was literally...
It must have been like 20 degrees.

1556
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,932
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1557
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:50,019
The fellow playing the priest
kept asking me for a line.

1558
01:50:50,228 --> 01:50:54,148
I said, "I can't give it to you.
You're just a background player."

1559
01:50:54,357 --> 01:50:58,236
He had 10 different ideas of how
he could have a speaking part in this.

1560
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:01,155
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1561
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:05,201
I really like James Franco's
performance in this scene.

1562
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,745
I feel he's becoming his father.

1563
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:12,333
Finally walking to that car that he was
so embarrassed of in the first scene.

1564
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:17,088
He's very understated.
He's just brilliant in this last part.

1565
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:23,094
You can feel the evil brewing
inside him, and the hatred.

1566
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:31,269
That's a great shot.
He's almost walking to his destiny.

1567
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:38,442
<i>No matter what I</i> do...

1568
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:41,737
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1569
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:46,117
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1570
01:51:56,878 --> 01:51:59,213
You must miss him so much.

1571
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:03,217
It's been so hard without him.

1572
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:09,015
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1573
01:52:10,808 --> 01:52:12,602
When I was up there...

1574
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:16,147
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1575
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:21,611
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1576
01:52:22,904 --> 01:52:26,115
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1577
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:30,328
There's many questions
when you go to shoot a scene.

1578
01:52:30,536 --> 01:52:35,333
I remember Tobey and Kirsten,
they brought so much to this scene.

1579
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:41,339
But one question was, they weren't
sure we should do the kiss at the end.

1580
01:52:43,007 --> 01:52:47,678
I really appreciate them going for it,
giving it a shot.

1581
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:51,349
Because it turned out...
And you never know it at the time...

1582
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:54,310
...but it wouldn't have even worked
without it.

1583
01:52:57,438 --> 01:53:01,859
We developed a great deal of trust
throughout the making of the movie.

1584
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:05,947
They were willing to try things.
They learn to trust you...

1585
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:09,200
...that if it doesn't work,
you won't keep it in the picture.

1586
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:12,870
Laura was a big advocate of it too.
I thank her for that. Our producer.

1587
01:53:13,037 --> 01:53:14,664
I love you.

1588
01:53:15,498 --> 01:53:19,502
You had a great collaboration
with these two. They're gifted...

1589
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:22,630
...well beyond their years.

1590
01:53:31,514 --> 01:53:35,393
Tobey did this scene.
Tobey screen-tested for the job.

1591
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:39,313
He did a version of this scene
which was the thing...

1592
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:42,108
The studio executives were in tears
when they saw it.

1593
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:47,863
That's when they said they knew he
was the perfect choice for the movie.

1594
01:53:48,531 --> 01:53:50,074
You can't what?

1595
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,660
Tell you...

1596
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:58,708
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1597
01:53:59,709 --> 01:54:02,253
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1598
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,756
Sam, if you were 19,
would you walk away?

1599
01:54:06,007 --> 01:54:09,552
I can't remember
what it was like being 19.

1600
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:13,848
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1601
01:54:14,849 --> 01:54:16,851
I promise you that.

1602
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:22,440
I will always be your friend.

1603
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:27,236
Only a friend...

1604
01:54:28,112 --> 01:54:29,655
...Peter Parker?

1605
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,660
That's all I have to give.

1606
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:50,301
This scene was a great combination...

1607
01:54:50,593 --> 01:54:56,474
...of David Koepp, Alvin Sargent,
great input from the producers...

1608
01:54:57,475 --> 01:54:59,226
...and, of course, the actors.

1609
01:54:59,477 --> 01:55:03,314
Laura did a lot of great work
on that scene.

1610
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:06,734
<i>I will never forget these words...</i>

1611
01:55:06,984 --> 01:55:10,488
As I watch him at the end here,
I really feel he has matured...

1612
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:16,494
...grown into the person
that his uncle thought he could be.

1613
01:55:17,203 --> 01:55:19,121
<i>Who am I?</i>

1614
01:55:19,497 --> 01:55:21,207
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>

1615
01:55:21,457 --> 01:55:24,752
This is the shot...
This shot was actually...

1616
01:55:25,002 --> 01:55:28,798
...literally conceived 18 months
before we delivered the movie.

1617
01:55:29,006 --> 01:55:32,009
They started working on the shot
and it was the last thing...

1618
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:34,011
...that came into the last shot.

1619
01:55:34,178 --> 01:55:37,348
It went into the film
just as we were finishing the dub.

1620
01:55:37,515 --> 01:55:41,310
- It's an absolutely amazing shot.
- Yeah, it is.

1621
01:55:43,521 --> 01:55:47,525
This is Sam Raimi, on behalf
of the cast and crew and everybody...

1622
01:55:47,733 --> 01:55:49,944
...thank you for watching the movie
with us.
