To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,096
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:16,437
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,772
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,236
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

She says you haven't been by in a while.

15
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,585
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,752
I have every right to be angry.

- What?

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,764
I was accepted into

at Midway City University.

20

We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

21
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,595
All we gotta do is use him to figure out
how to steal Zoom's speed,

22
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,014
and then we'll get your daughter back.

23
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,023
That might take longer than we thought.

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,307

25
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,192

in that vat of boiling tar?

was unimaginable.

buy this garage two years ago.

Actually, the depth and uniformity
of the burn pattern

195
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,344
is something you would see if the body was

covered in something like lava
but with a lower burn temp.

And an added chemical characteristic.

a secondary accelerant.

- Tar Pit, uh, was after one Clay Stanley.

Stanley, as it turns out,
is a suspected hitman

about you.

then why are you in so deep with them?

414
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,883
to earn money
for Francine's medical bills.

415
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,417
Well, there are no medical bills anymore.

416
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,177
So why are you still doing it?

417
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,181
Look, I am not gonna pretend

418
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,557
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you.

419
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,263
But in the short time
that I got to spend with her,

420
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,429
I saw what kind of person she had become.

421
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,353
She was smart and kind and loving.

422
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,233
So I can't even imagine
how much you miss her.

423

You don't know what I'm feeling.

424
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,190
Well, let me tell you how I feel.

convince everyone that you are a badass,

but I know that you're a good kid, Wally.

427
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,240
And you didn't get that way
raising yourself.

428
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:24,203
You had a single mother who cared for you.

429
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,835
So my dad and I care
whether you wrap yourself around a tree

or get shot by one of these gangsters.

cannot be a new sensation for you.

between you and my daughter,

and every time,
unblinkingly, unflinchingly,

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,108
I felt slower tonight.

635
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,772
You know, not by much, but enough.

636
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,692
Do you think there's something wrong
with the suit, maybe?

637
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,234
It's unlikely.

638
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,948
The readings from the suit are normal.

639
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,237
You know I take care of that thing.

640
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:53,405
Yeah, what? Am I sick?

641
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,788
I don't know. Do you feel any different?

642
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,672
No. Not really. I mean,
I know that I'm slower in the moment,

643
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:02,923
but I can't tell by how much.

644
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,380
CAITLIN: Two percent.

645
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,712
Tests on the components in your blood
show the Speed Force

646
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,347
at a 100% for the last 60 days.

647
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,760
Until today. lt dropped to 98.

648
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,472
Zoom stole Jay's speed.

649
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,809
Do you think maybe
during your fight with Zoom,

650
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,063
yours might have diminished?

651
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,269
But that was weeks ago.

652
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,934
Why would I Just be feeling
those effects now?

653
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,440
- Doctor Wells.
- Yeah?

654
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,856
You've studied the Speed Force
more than anyone.

655
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:27,614
What do you think could have happened?

656
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:29,492
It could be any number of things.

657
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,032
Yeah, all right...

658
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:37,163
It's just... Look, I mean,
Iris could've died tonight.

659
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:38,702
She's gonna be okay, Barry.

660
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:42,588
You know, this time. But the fact is,
she is hurt right now because of me.

661
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:46,717
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris
just from some meta-human tonight.

662
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,673
When Zoom attacks again,
I need all of my speed, and then some.

663
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,344
I can't lose anyone else.

664
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,396
You won't.

665
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,523
- I did it.
- What?

666
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that?

667
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,873
I stole your speed.

668
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,543
I gave it to Zoom.

669
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:24,501
No. This isn't...
What, are... You're working with Zoom?

670
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,041
No. Not at first.

671
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,963
We trusted you. I trusted you!

672
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,887
Joe, stop!

673
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,097
Why'd you put him in there?

674
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,436
Because if I didn't,
lwould've killed him.

675
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,351
Now, let's go find this tar freak.

676
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,074
- Yo! What the hell, man!
- Shut up.

677
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,710
- I thought I was being transferred.
- (CHUCKLES)

678
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,081
You're not being transferred.
You're the bait.

679
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,041
What?

680
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:19,472
This is for two years ago, Clay!

681
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,438
(GRUNTS)

682
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,157
Stay.

683
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,413
(GRUNTS)

684
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,382
You know, it's ironic.

685
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,768
I wasjust saying how much you remind me
of the old Wells.

686
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,851
And now, here we are,
just like I did with him,

687
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:08,268
standing on either side of this glass
with me asking you why.

688
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,858
I'm doing what I have to do
to save my daughter.

689
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:12,396
Yeah, at any cost, right?

690
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,690
At the cost of Joe's daughter?

691
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,485
I told you I would betray you.

692
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,329
I told you I would have to choose.

693
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,659
You chose wrong.

694
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,409
Really, Detective?
Because I just sacrificed my daughter.

695
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,670
Because I Just sentenced my daughter
to death to save your son.

696
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,081
You want a pat on the back?

697
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,748
I want you to send me home.

698
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,634
Send me back to Earth-2.

699
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,215
Think about it.

700
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,927
Zoom wants you to get faster,

701
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:41,559
he wants you to have more Speed Force
in you for when he finally takes it.

702
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,516
Send me back, use the Implosion Reactor
to shut down the breach.

703
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,601
Shut down all the breaches.

704
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,190
Close them all.

705
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,320
And Zoom will never be
able to cross over, ever again.

706
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,652
And that'll be the end of it.

707
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,358
What about your daughter?

708
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,534
Jesse's my battle to fight. Not yours.

709
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
(GROANS)

710
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,722
Hey. How are you feeling?

711
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,807
Mmm, like I could
use some pizza right now.

712
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,057
(BOTH LAUGH)

713
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,063
But they're letting you out tomorrow,
so I can get you any kind you want.

714
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,731
- From anywhere you want.
- Deal.

715
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,735
You know, um,

716
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:45,157
growing up, we didn't have a lot of money
to go to the movies or buy toys.

717
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:50,670
Instead, she would just take me in the car
and we'd go for these long drives.

718
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,956
Just her and I and her music.

719
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,590
I remember being on the road with her
and just...

720
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,431
Watching the scenery flash by
and feeling so happy.

721
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,766
Now, when I race,

722
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,440
feeling that rush of speed, it's like...

723
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,487
It's like I get to go back to those days.

724
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,028
I didn't want to stop, because if I do...

725
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,371
(SIGHS)

726
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,291
See? That wasn't so hard.

727
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,217
- Actually, it was pretty hard.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

728
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,719
This is a sample of Barry's cells
after whatever Harry did to them.

729
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,182
As you can see,
not only is it drained of the Speed Force

730
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:52,690
but it's also presenting itself
as chromosomal damage.

731
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,351
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

732
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,487
he could have taken
your powers permanently.

733
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,152
Even Evil Wells couldn't figure out
how to do that one.

734
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,532
Well, look.
Somebody better send his ass back

735
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,068
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

736
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,657
- Amen.
- No.

737
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,829
What do you mean, "no"?

738
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,335
What would we have done,
ifwe were in his position?

739
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,543
I mean, what would you do
if it was Iris, Joe?

740
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,208
Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

741
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:20,797
threatened to kill your brother
unless you helped, you did.

742
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,259
And none of us judged you for that.
We still don't.

743
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,052
Because when it comes to family,

744
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,059
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

745
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,021
we're all vulnerable. None of us are
above making a wrong decision.

746
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,688
He could have done it,
he could've stolen my speed,

747
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,853
gotten away with it.
None of us would've even known.

748
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,192
But he didn't.

749
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,483
And now his daughter's gonna die
and we're okay with that?

750
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,074
I can't just give up on her.

751
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,862
I can't give up on a world.

752
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:51,282
This is a world full of people
who are facing death.

753
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,086
I don't know, I mean, I may not be
fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but...

754
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,132
I'm not gonna just close the breaches
and forget about it.

755
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,304
We have to help Wells.

756
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,391
Look, guys, I...

757
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,679
I was the one that trusted him first.

758
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:13,891
I own that.

759
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,184
I let him stay when literally all of you
told me not to.

760
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,853
So everything that's happened up
until this point, it's on me.

761
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:22,237
But this has to be a group decision.

762
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:29,615
Come on.

763
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,539
Well...

764
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,880
I guess this is good-bye.

765
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,262
No. It's not.

766
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,132
I told you we're a team.

767
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,009
Now you're a part of it.

768
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,184
We're gonna help you save Jesse.
We're not sending you through alone.

769
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,981
We're going to Earth-2.
