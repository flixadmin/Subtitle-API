00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:06,004
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,407
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:11,543
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,011
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,013
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,316
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:</i>

8
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,850
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,119
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,854
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,058
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,862
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,464
We're in the temporal zone.
I don't understand.

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,899
No one should be able to...

15
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,068
<i>A scan of the vessel
suggests that it is</i>

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,600
<i>the bounty hunter, Chronos.</i>

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,541
- Argh!
- A crash landing...

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,343
in both place and time.

19
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,691
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

20
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,926
This doesn't look like
the type of place

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,328
we want to linger
out in the open.

22
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,934
That looks a lot like
a Palmer tech building,

23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,269
but why does it have
a Smoak logo on it?

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,706
Wait, this is Star City.

25
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,242
I thought you said
the timeline was safe.

26
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,278
Yes, Star City was
intact in 2016.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,916
This... this is 2046.

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,389
Don't move!

29
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,423
Thank god.

30
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,259
I said don't move.

31
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,361
It's me.

32
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,963
It's Sara.

33
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,331
Hey, Oliver, look.

34
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,932
I know it's been a long time.

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,834
But don't you remember
that Rip Hunter

36
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,636
Recruited us to become legends?

37
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,574
I never heard
of any legends.

38
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,016
Get back!

39
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,457
This guy a friend of yours?
I don't like him.

40
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,530
What are you doing?

41
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,132
It's called shooting back.

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,366
Can't be the Green Arrow.

43
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,998
That's not Oliver Queen.

44
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,543
Sure dresses like him.

45
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,107
Shoots arrows like him.

46
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,248
Well, whoever he is,
I don't plan on sticking around

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,650
to get shish-kebabbed by this dude.

48
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,352
Kid's right.

49
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,921
Let's stay behind and kill him.

50
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,058
We need you in charge
of the ship.

51
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,375
All right, Rip.
Tell us the truth.

52
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,011
You've all seen how
the timeline is malleable...

53
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,480
In flux until it is set.

54
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:05,116
Well,
this future is not set.

55
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,085
Remember when I told you
it was dangerous

56
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,454
For any of you to know too much
about your own futures?

57
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,557
Well, the events that you dread
could very well come to be

58
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,092
Due to your actions
to prevent them.

59
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,628
You know what I think?
I think you think too much.

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,630
Believe me when I tell you
that the best thing

61
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,165
For yourselves
and for this mission

62
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,335
Is to make the repairs
to the Waverider here in 2046

63
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,769
Then head back to your own time

64
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,173
And make that none of this
ever comes to be.

65
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,745
Looks like the whole
propulsion system's jacked.

66
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,380
How do you even know what
we're looking at here?

67
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,616
Doesn't matter if it takes you
down the road or through time.

68
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,885
An engine's still an engine.

69
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,620
How long will it take you
to make repairs?

70
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,755
I'm not too sure,
but it would go a lot faster

71
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,990
If I had some help.

72
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,558
Maybe Kendra
could lend me a hand?

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,959
Enlist whoever
is free to help,

74
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,628
I have this to contend with.

75
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,296
This is the neuromorphic
interface

76
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,031
for Gideon's logic
and navigation matrix.

77
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,367
Without it, Gideon
cannot function.

78
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,599
Well, that explains how we got
stranded here in the future.

79
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,737
Palmer tech was working on

80
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,272
a self-learning,
neuromorphic cortex.

81
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,207
They surely would have gone
to prototype by 2046.

82
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,775
We are going to
need that prototype.

83
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,644
Ah, Palmer tech is now
Smoak technologies,

84
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,076
But, uh, I'm sure I can
still get us in.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,414
As I said, we must keep
you and Ms. Lance

86
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,616
separate from your future homes.

87
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,217
In any case, there's a reason

88
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,919
why I recruited individuals

89
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,789
adept at misappropriating
others' property.

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,457
It's not money.
It's not jewels.

91
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,226
It's not a valuable artifact.

92
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,595
You're just lucky I'll steal
anything right about now.

93
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,131
- As I suspected.
- We'll get your gizmo.

94
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,233
You just get this bucket
flying again.

95
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,902
- I'm coming with.
- No, no you are not.

96
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,204
You're too emotionally
connected to the city.

97
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,636
- We've been over this.
- I'm over you.

98
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,908
You got us on a mission

99
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,643
to change the timeline
for yourself.

100
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,879
And you won't even let us
look at our futures?

101
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,782
Now, I know this city
better than anyone else,

102
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,784
and you're gonna
need me out there.

103
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,920
So, either I'm coming with,

104
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,822
or we can find out
if the Time Masters

105
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,424
are as good at teaching
people to fight

106
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,259
as the league of assassins.

107
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,201
So the rest of the team's
on a field trip to Palmer tech,

108
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,103
now Smoak technologies.

109
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,705
Palmer tech
sounds better, right?

110
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:07,906
Be honest.

111
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,841
Honestly, they sound
about the same.

112
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,610
Even assuming our
compatriots return

113
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,244
with a neuromorphic prototype,

114
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,914
we'll still need to prepare
Gideon for the new device.

115
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,783
And the engines could
definitely use some loving.

116
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,885
Actually, I could use
an extra pair of hands.

117
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,454
Well, Raymond, why don't
you and Ms. Saunders

118
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,922
Continue repairing Gideon,

119
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,257
And I'll assist Jefferson
with the engines?

120
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,699
This is just
a potential future.

121
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,835
It doesn't matter if we
kill anyone here, right?

122
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,371
Well, to avoid the risk
of a paradox,

123
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:43,975
It's probably best to refrain
from killing anyone.

124
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,145
I'm not gonna
promise anything.

125
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,914
My sister's apartment
used to be over here.

126
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,216
I seem to remember something

127
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,119
About your father being
a police Captain.

128
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:58,757
- Your point?
- Did one hell of a job.

129
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,759
My father and everyone else

130
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,361
would never have
let this happen...

131
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,797
Unless they were all dead.

132
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,836
You really are
pretty good at this.

133
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,040
Yeah, I was a shipyard welder
in 1944.

134
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,742
No way.
A real life Rosie the Riveter?

135
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,813
<i>Is there anything
you can't manage</i>

136
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,081
<i>to put a positive spin on?</i>

137
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,418
<i>Uh, no, I got it:
The DMV.</i>

138
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,855
So you do have a dark side.

139
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,123
You making fun of me?

140
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,658
Little bit.

141
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,629
Doesn't mean I don't find
your unwavering optimism...

142
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,064
Enjoyable.

143
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,866
<i>I find watching
you weld enjoyable.</i>

144
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,037
Dr. Palmer,
in case you weren't aware,

145
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,706
You are on an open channel,

146
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,474
And we can hear
everything you're saying.

147
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,942
Is it too much to ask for some

148
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,578
Professionalism around here,
and...

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,681
Why am I getting so upset?

150
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,249
One moment, please.

151
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,986
I'm not upset.
You're upset.

152
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,354
No, I'm not.

153
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,824
My elevated blood pressure
confirms that you are.

154
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,226
I'm just...

155
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,794
I'm just getting annoyed
that those two

156
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,862
Are talking instead of working.

157
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,798
I mean...

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,934
- You like her.
- Dude, you're being crazy.

159
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,602
You do remember
that we share

160
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,170
A psychic connection.

161
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,505
I can sense
what you're feeling.

162
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,140
If that were true,
then you would shut up.

163
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,709
Hey, it's no day at the beach
for me, either.

164
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,810
Believe me.

165
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,378
Well, it doesn't matter,

166
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,614
'cause I don't stand
a chance with her anyway.

167
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,015
Now,
why would you say that?

168
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,884
Because right now,
my competition

169
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,253
Is a billionaire genius
who built his own super-suit

170
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,589
And some other dude she's known
for 4,000 years

171
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,724
Who she is destined to be with.

172
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,959
If I may offer
one word of advice...

173
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,093
I really wish you wouldn't.

174
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,463
That word would
be "confidence".

175
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,401
You met my younger self.

176
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,737
I was quite the ladies' man.

177
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,773
Put yourself out there.

178
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,475
Good things will happen.

179
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,015
Palmer tech's
just two blocks up this way.

180
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,951
Or at least it used to be.

181
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,753
Take cover in there!

182
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,888
It's like World War III
out there.

183
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,163
It's beautiful.

184
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,340
We need to find another route.

185
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,988
Argh!

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,660
Ms. Lance, don't.
Sara!

187
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,528
Damn it!

188
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,630
You two... don't move.
We'll be right back.

189
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,765
Right.

190
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,333
We're not gonna sit here,
right?

191
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,602
Imagine all the looting
we can do in this chaos.

192
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,038
Why don't we stretch our legs
at that bank we passed

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,473
Three blocks back?

194
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,887
Drop your weapons,
and hand over your wallets.

195
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,590
Wait, are you actually
trying to mug us?

196
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,558
What is this, amateur hour?

197
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,293
If you don't do
what my man says,

198
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,462
We're gonna crush you
into the pavement

199
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,797
Like a couple of ants.

200
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,131
Really?

201
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,301
What do you say we teach
these fellas a lesson?

202
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,502
Yeah.

203
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,078
Ooh.

204
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,180
That's what you get when
you don't follow directions.

205
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,884
Interesting.
Hold this.

206
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,521
Second thoughts...

207
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,423
Argh!

208
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,560
Whoa!
Where did you get that?

209
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,028
Ebay.

210
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,835
Now, your boss will
not be needing this.

211
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,676
Well, this has been fun,
but I think it's time to leave.

212
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,112
Leave?

213
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,880
Why would we leave?

214
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,688
Ah!

215
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,822
Come on, sweetheart.

216
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,470
Don't move.

217
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,407
You...

218
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,942
You are persistent.

219
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,643
I saw you get shot
point-blank.

220
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,080
It's high-density Kevlar,
now... Who the hell are you?

221
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,049
- Who are you?
- I'm the Green Arrow.

222
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:55,053
Oliver Queen
is the Green Arrow.

223
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,688
No, he's not.

224
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,423
Oliver Queen is dead.

225
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,829
How did Oliver die?

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,231
I don't know.
No one does.

227
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,334
No one's seen him since...

228
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,496
- Well, since the uprising.
- Uprising?

229
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,239
Is just what people
called it when...

230
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,541
Well, when all this happened.

231
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,177
15 years ago, he brought
an army with him.

232
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,448
- Who brought an army?
- I did.

233
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,852
No, it's not possible.

234
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,565
How did you get off Lian Yu?

235
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,267
Say something, damn it!

236
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,937
Ms. Lance?
Who is this?

237
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,472
Somebody very dangerous.

238
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,240
Then now is not the right
time for me to say it...

239
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,642
But please, remind me later
to tell you that I told you so.

240
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,045
How are you still alive,
Slade?

241
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,415
Slade.

242
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,618
That's a name I haven't heard
in a long time.

243
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,228
How do you know my father?

244
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,096
He called you Ms. Lance.

245
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,200
Any relation to the late
Captain Lance?

246
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,704
If so, you must have heard
stories about my father.

247
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,906
I knew your father.

248
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,108
He was insane.

249
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,178
Seems to run in the family.

250
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,882
I'm going to enjoy
killing you...

251
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,050
Or we will.

252
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,525
Okay, bad idea.

253
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,293
Come on.

254
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,758
All right.

255
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,226
Grey and I have got
the mains back online.

256
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,335
Great. Uh...

257
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,737
Ray's working on something
called the quantum manifold.

258
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,875
But I can't seem to
get this to cooperate.

259
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,244
Let me give it a try.

260
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, you actually seem
to know what you're doing here.

261
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,852
Uh, yeah, machines
are kind of my thing.

262
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,084
Plus, I've been looking
at the instruction manual

263
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,289
in my downtime, so...

264
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,723
Most people can't follow

265
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,325
the instructions to build
their new bookcase,

266
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,060
and here you are working
on a spaceship.

267
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,931
A time-traveling spaceship
from the future, no less.

268
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,666
Well, when you
put it like that,

269
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,034
I am kind of amazing.

270
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,436
And humble.

271
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,872
Hey, if you ever
have any bookcases

272
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:28,940
need putting together...

273
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,241
I'll know who to call.

274
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,848
So, Raymond,

275
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,318
you were working with
Kendra earlier.

276
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,486
I couldn't help but notice

277
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,187
There might've been a little...

278
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,956
Spark.

279
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,757
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

280
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,527
It was quite apparent
and if I'm not mistaken,

281
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,131
I've noticed her throwing
one or two glances your way.

282
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,233
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,501
Wow, that's...
that's surprising.

284
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,103
- Is it?
- Well, yeah.

285
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,640
I don't know, I hadn't really
considered her in that way.

286
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,577
Why are you bringing this up?

287
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,579
Jeez, I feel like I'm
back in high school.

288
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,048
I honestly wouldn't know.
I skipped 10th grade.

289
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,583
And 11th.

290
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,519
I haven't really spent
that much time with Kendra.

291
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,488
You know, other than time that
we shared with her

292
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,223
And her reincarnated soulmate,

293
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,325
Or people trying to kill us.

294
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,661
All the more reason to avoid

295
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,497
Personal attachments.

296
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,635
This ship may be large,
but our group is small.

297
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,537
Hmm. Yeah.

298
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,305
Preaching to the choir,
Professor.

299
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,574
We're onboard the Waverider
to save the world...

300
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,177
Not hook up.

301
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,913
Yes, quite right.

302
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,560
Hey, you,
I'm terrible with names.

303
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,528
- I'm gonna call you Fonzie.
- Yeah!

304
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,630
- I'm gonna call you Kenickie.
- Yeah!

305
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,232
Anyone else here need a name?

306
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,670
Your highness, can I get
a moment of your time, please?

307
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,905
Sure.

308
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,775
Ah, isn't the future great?

309
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,978
We really should be
getting back to Rip and Sara.

310
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,479
Why?

311
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,949
'Cause I'm not looking
to put down roots here.

312
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,818
Why not? It's everything
we've ever wanted.

313
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,088
I got a gang that does
everything I tell them to.

314
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,057
I got a fur coat.

315
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,692
I got a chalice.

316
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,327
Speaking of.

317
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,264
- What about stopping Savage?
- What about it?

318
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,432
You're the one who said
we're in this

319
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,167
For the score, remember?

320
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,102
We could live like kings here.

321
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,238
No cops, no heroes...

322
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,406
Just some fool
in a green hoodie.

323
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,208
It's Christmas every day.

324
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,844
Ah, my sweet.

325
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:58,256
Slade had a son?

326
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,057
Look, Oliver tried.

327
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,028
He tried to raise an army
to fight Deathstroke, but...

328
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,930
Everyone just wanted
to evacuate.

329
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,866
How can you save a city
that doesn't want to be saved?

330
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,571
A moment. Sara, I know what
you must be thinking,

331
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,172
But none of what
has transpired here

332
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,574
Is your fault,
nor do you have the means

333
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,243
To change it,
but Vandal Savage's future

334
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,012
Is preventable.

335
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,513
I implore you,

336
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,983
Please stay focused
on our mission.

337
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,515
We're very grateful
for your assistance,

338
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,753
but we really must
be moving along

339
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,292
- to Smoak technologies.
- What for?

340
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,960
That place has been
cleared out for years,

341
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,929
but a lot of Felicity Smoak's
projects got relocated.

342
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,265
Where?

343
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,167
Come on.

344
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:52,243
You didn't say that Felicity's
equipment would be here.

345
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,881
Well, where else would
you think it'd be?

346
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,597
Mr. Queen's base of operations

347
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,566
Appears to have
seen better days.

348
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,769
Yeah, well...

349
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,638
The place got attacked
after Grant Wilson

350
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,840
Outed Queen
as the Green Arrow.

351
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,579
Let's just find what
we're looking for

352
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,181
And get out of here.

353
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,253
Whoever's there, get out.

354
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,189
I said get out!

355
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,592
Whoever you are, get out.

356
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,464
Oliver?

357
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,205
Hello, Sara.

358
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,940
Long time, no see.

359
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,249
- Is that...
- Oliver Queen.

360
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,919
Everyone thinks
that you're dead.

361
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,288
They're not wrong.

362
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,556
Put the arrow down, John.

363
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,592
You're embarrassing yourself.

364
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,894
- John?
- John Diggle junior.

365
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,733
My dad is dead

366
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,603
Because I couldn't save him.

367
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,473
I don't deserve his name.
I'm Connor Hawke.

368
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,008
So you won't take his name,

369
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,077
But it's all right
to parade around

370
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,445
In someone else's outfit?

371
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,680
Well, someone has to,

372
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,850
Because last time
that I checked, you were dead.

373
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,787
Everyone thought you were dead.

374
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,124
I've been trying to hold
this city by myself

375
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,126
Because I thought you were gone.

376
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,528
What happened to you?

377
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,870
To Laurel, to my dad...

378
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,940
- Felicity...
- They're gone.

379
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,502
- All of them.
- What do you mean?

380
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,543
- Ollie...
- Gone.

381
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,749
What do you want me
to say, Sara?

382
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:16,520
30 years ago, you and Ray
hopped on a spaceship.

383
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,682
- And you never came back.
- We will.

384
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,121
I don't want to say that...

385
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,593
things would have
ended differently

386
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,495
if you and Ray
had been here, but...

387
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,464
But if we were,
it could've made the difference.

388
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,202
You thought I was dead.
What are you doing here?

389
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,904
We were looking for
a neuromorphic prototype

390
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,673
That Felicity Smoak
was working on.

391
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,109
Felicity left after
everything that happened.

392
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,045
Everything her company
was working on

393
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,747
is being kept in a warehouse
at Adams and O'Neil.

394
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,250
- Entry code is 4-5-8-7.
- Thank you, Mr.

395
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,414
You found your way in...

396
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,490
Find your way out.

397
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,065
I got to admit,
that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

398
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,267
So things went well
with Ms. Saunders?

399
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,268
Oh, yeah.

400
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,369
Well, I have more good news.

401
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,506
I was able to very subtly
confirm

402
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,175
That Raymond has
no romantic inclinations

403
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,544
Towards your crush object.

404
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,980
Okay, well, once we've
sorted out my love life,

405
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,315
We need to update
your vocabulary.

406
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,717
Can't wait.

407
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,885
I'm gonna
go check on Kendra.

408
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,854
- Hey... confidence.
- Yeah.

409
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,589
Hey.

410
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,625
I got the initial dampeners
back online.

411
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,859
Once the rest of the team
returns with

412
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,927
The neuromorphic prototype,

413
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,228
Gideon will be good to go.

414
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,396
Excellent.

415
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,831
Sooner we get out of here,
the better.

416
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,900
- And thank you, by the way.
- Whatever for?

417
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,468
Well, till you mentioned it,

418
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,770
I hadn't really thought
about Kendra in that way,

419
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,572
Because, you know,
she and Carter

420
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,774
Were destined to be together
in this lifetime,

421
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,776
But it's all changed

422
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,612
And, uh, you know,
she's quirky

423
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,414
And funny and beautiful

424
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,216
And a pretty good welder.

425
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,584
So... you know,

426
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,421
What about all those things
we were talking about?

427
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,856
The mission and so forth?

428
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,726
Oh, well,
we're all adults here, right?

429
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,228
Getting to know each other
a little bit better,

430
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,365
It's not gonna stop us
from saving the world.

431
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh, boy.

432
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,615
Who invited them?

433
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,983
Word on the street
is Deathstroke

434
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,518
Is pissed about something.

435
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,920
Deathstroke...
what kind of name's that?

436
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,427
Party's over.
Everyone hit the streets.

437
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,595
Hit everybody on them.

438
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,863
I want Green Arrow
dead by morning.

439
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,800
Listen, pal,
this is my gang.

440
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,135
The only orders they take
are from me.

441
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,639
Hmm, might be your gang,
but it's my city.

442
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,311
Green Arrow is running with
a female assassin in white

443
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,449
And a Brit in a brown coat.
Kill them all.

444
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,361
Heard the man.
Let's go.

445
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,795
Looks like your new minions

446
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,964
Are about to go on
a citywide manhunt

447
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,400
For Rip and Sara.
So what?

448
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,268
They're gonna kill
our friends.

449
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,404
Since when did they
become our friends?

450
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,772
You tell me.

451
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,340
You and Raymond seemed
to get pretty tight

452
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,575
Back in Russia.

453
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,809
I've never been
tight with anyone.

454
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,013
Mick, it's time to go.

455
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,182
- You're not the boss of me.
- Actually, I am.

456
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,757
Okay, let's both
take a deep breath.

457
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,027
And we'll make
ourselves a deal.

458
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,928
You help me
get to Rip and Sara.

459
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,432
Once they're safe,
we can have this conversation.

460
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,434
Fair?

461
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,547
Thank you for agreeing
to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

462
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,516
It's Connor.

463
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,748
It's not like I needed

464
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,712
to stick around Oliver Queen
for anything.

465
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,428
- Did you know?
- Know what?

466
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,766
That this is what
would happen in my city?

467
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,435
Oliver said that
the only reason

468
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,836
that things got so bad

469
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,571
is because Ray and I
weren't there to help.

470
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,073
I suspected that
might be the case,

471
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,942
but that's actually
a good thing. Hm?

472
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,011
Now, once our mission
is complete

473
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,314
and you and Dr. Palmer are
returned to Star City in 2016,

474
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:41,318
you will both be present
to stop Grant Wilson's uprising.

475
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,721
This future is only
a potential timeline.

476
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,323
So this...
this version of Star City...

477
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,691
This doesn't have to happen?

478
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,760
Correct.
The future is always in flux.

479
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:54,264
Hopefully, this will
never come to pass.

480
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,467
This world isn't real.

481
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:00,571
Let's split up.
We'll cover more ground.

482
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,324
Hello, beautiful.

483
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,613
There's too many of them!

484
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,724
Gentlemen, your timing
is exemplary.

485
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,730
Where's Connor?

486
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,340
He's been taken.

487
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:50,881
These are Grant Wilson's men.

488
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,282
Hmm.

489
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,684
The guy with the half face
and the body armor

490
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:57,321
Has a real mad-on
for the kid in the hoodie.

491
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,357
- Can I have a word?
- Rip...

492
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,859
I know what you're
going to say.

493
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,560
- We have to get him back.
- Yes, that.

494
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,828
You're forgetting this future

495
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,163
Is only a potential timeline.

496
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,831
Yeah, where Grant Wilson
kills Connor.

497
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,199
Wilson's not going
to murder Connor,

498
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,034
Because once you're
returned to 2016,

499
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,071
There won't be a Wilson
or a Connor,

500
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,641
At least not as we know them
both right now.

501
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,942
Now that we rescued them,

502
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,011
Let's have that chat.

503
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,946
You want to stay here.

504
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,348
Thought I made that
pretty clear.

505
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,185
What I'm less clear on
is why you don't.

506
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,454
A city of thieves
and criminals...

507
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,089
Sounds like a lot
of competition.

508
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,724
Then we wipe them out.

509
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,058
What I did to that other guy,

510
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,194
We do the same thing
to this Grant Wilson

511
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,764
And anyone else stupid enough
to get in our way.

512
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,033
Take a look around, Snart.

513
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,735
We're living the dream.

514
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,504
Yeah.
Speaking of which...

515
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,809
Sleep tight, buddy.

516
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,944
What happened to him?

517
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,679
Difference of opinion.

518
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,947
Right.

519
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,716
We need to get this
and Mr. Rory

520
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,685
Back to the Waverider.

521
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,792
Ugh!

522
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,427
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

523
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,063
I'm in need of your
mechanical acumen.

524
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,698
Okay, let's do it.

525
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,271
- What?
- What did you do?

526
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,439
I don't know what
you're talking about.

527
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,808
You did something.
What did you do?

528
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,176
Nothing, nothing.

529
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,679
You know, this psychic
connection thing,

530
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,080
It goes both ways

531
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,381
And the moment that
I walked in here,

532
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,884
I started feeling
really anxious and guilty.

533
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,519
You feel guilty,
so what did you do?

534
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,087
In my defense, I was only
acting in your best interests.

535
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,488
What did you do?

536
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,290
It's possible in my
attempt to discern

537
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,926
Whether Dr. Palmer had competing
feelings for Ms. Saunders...

538
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,194
Oh, you didn't...

539
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,562
I may have inadvertently
prompted him

540
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,065
To think of her in ways
in which...

541
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,199
He hadn't.

542
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,701
- Ugh, Grey!
- I'm sorry.

543
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:55,072
My intentions were honorable.

544
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,574
Ah, it's cool.

545
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,977
- Is it?
- Yeah.

546
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,979
I mean, nothing's
really changed

547
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,081
Apart from the fact that
now I got competition

548
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,682
I didn't have before,

549
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,919
But I should still have
confidence in myself.

550
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,488
Right?

551
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,124
Right.

552
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,258
Oh, they're back.

553
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,060
Where's Mr. Rory?

554
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,395
Sleeping it off.

555
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,097
We have
the neuromorphic prototype.

556
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,765
Any luck with
the ship's engines?

557
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,201
Yeah, it's all good.

558
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,903
Is there something
wrong, Ms. Lance?

559
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,107
Well, all my friends
and family are dead,

560
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,076
Except for Oliver Queen,
who happens to be dead inside

561
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,111
And missing his left arm.

562
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,345
Sara, I have told you...

563
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,048
That this is just
a potential future

564
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,649
And that it's all gonna go back

565
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,885
When we return to 2016...

566
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,854
If we return.

567
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,188
But what if we don't?

568
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,324
We all know Carter's
not coming back.

569
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,127
It's not like we have
the safest line of work.

570
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,662
I think if Sara wants
to stay and help

571
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,031
That then we should.

572
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,363
I mean, that's what
we signed up for:

573
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,434
- To be heroes.
- I agree with Jefferson.

574
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,802
Yes, of course you both do,

575
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,670
because neither of you
understand the pitfalls

576
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,139
Of changing the timeline.

577
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,641
Meddling with the future
is arguably more dangerous

578
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,503
than changing the past,
because it is still in flux.

579
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,513
Your wife and son's death
are in the future.

580
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,398
You want us to change that.

581
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,650
Do not play that
card with me.

582
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,900
So what?

583
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:17,652
Are you only willing
to risk the timeline

584
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,922
if it's your own family?

585
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,358
I am not just trying
to save my family

586
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,061
And I'm not just trying
to save one city,

587
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,096
But the entire world!

588
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,098
I'm not being selfish, Sara.

589
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,200
Go to hell.

590
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,602
Most likely.

591
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,671
If you want to go
and save Mr. Hawke,

592
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,106
Then be my guest.

593
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,741
I'll keep the ship here
for one hour,

594
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,742
Then we're leaving.

595
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,111
With you on board or without.

596
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,052
Hello, Mick.

597
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,153
You son of a bitch.

598
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,888
Just calm down.

599
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,023
You lied to me!

600
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,393
Wouldn't be the first time.

601
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,862
Remember the Del Ray
currency exchange?

602
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,498
The blackhawk armored car job?

603
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,100
If I hadn't lied to you
on those scores,

604
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,069
we'd both be
in prison or dead.

605
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,271
I'm the brains.
You're the muscle.

606
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,207
That's how it's always been.

607
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,777
And on occasion,
I've had to call some audibles.

608
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,546
You have a habit of getting
in your own way, Mick.

609
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,282
You're right.

610
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,984
You've lied to me
about jobs before,

611
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,252
But then again,
you lied to me

612
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,620
About this being a job.

613
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,323
It's not about the score
anymore for you.

614
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,694
You'd rather save the world
than be my partner.

615
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,362
A real team player.

616
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,132
'Cause that's what it's
gonna take to defeat Savage.

617
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,235
Then what? More money?
More power?

618
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,303
A life of leisure and sin?

619
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,771
Don't you get it, Mick?

620
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,107
If we take out Savage,
this immortal monster,

621
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,709
Can't you see
what that gets us?

622
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,010
No, tell me.

623
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,413
We'd be the two baddest
sons of bitches of all time.

624
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,251
I don't want
a ticker tape parade.

625
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:58,155
You know what I want
from this world.

626
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,223
Yes...

627
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,859
To see it burn.

628
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,562
You lay a hand on me again,

629
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,732
You'll burn too.

630
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:15,805
Oliver.

631
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,840
Oliver!

632
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,911
Thought I told you to go.

633
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,313
Grant Wilson has Connor.

634
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,614
They're gonna kill him.

635
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,484
He knew what he
was signing up for

636
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,120
And you there's nothing
I can do to help him.

637
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,255
That's not the Oliver Queen
that I know.

638
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,458
Maybe I'm not that
person anymore.

639
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,860
Look at me, Sara.

640
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,030
I'm literally half the man
I used to be.

641
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,866
Then that's the half
this city needs.

642
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,435
He's got too many men, Ollie.

643
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,404
I can't do this by myself.

644
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,939
What about your friends?

645
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,141
I'm on my own...

646
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,376
Unless I'm not.

647
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,114
Come on, Sara.

648
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,549
I never got the chance
to ask Connor

649
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,352
Why he wears the hood,
but I know why.

650
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,623
It's because this city

651
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,825
Will always need a Green Arrow.

652
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,271
Is the ship ready
for departure?

653
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,440
No, Ms. Lance is
not yet onboard.

654
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,008
I gave her an hour.

655
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,042
Hardly enough time for...

656
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,277
And she's been 90 minutes.

657
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,713
How much longer are
we supposed to wait?

658
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:33,483
It doesn't matter that
this is a potential future.

659
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,318
It doesn't matter that this

660
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,319
May never come to pass...

661
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,121
May never be real.

662
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,457
For Sara, this is very real.

663
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,758
I know, which is why
I gave her

664
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,626
An extra 30 minutes.

665
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,094
Gideon, what's our status?

666
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,829
<i>The Waverider
is operational, Captain,</i>

667
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,330
<i>But I can't guarantee
for how long.</i>

668
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,732
- Explain.
<i>- We are cloaked,</i>

669
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,594
<i>but positioned
dangerously close</i>

670
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,469
<i>to where the city's criminal
element is gathering</i>

671
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,404
<i>to witness the execution
of Connor Hawke.</i>

672
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,006
<i>The longer we wait,
the greater the risk</i>

673
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,638
<i>of detection and further
damage to the ship.</i>

674
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,010
Do you really want to risk

675
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,512
being marooned in this version
of 2046 forever?

676
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,515
Certainly more than I
want to maroon Sara here.

677
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:09,786
She's our friend.
Our teammate.

678
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,155
What's the point
of stopping Savage

679
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,724
If we only become
as immoral as he is

680
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,028
In the process?

681
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,113
You should be honored.

682
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,049
This is hallowed ground.

683
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,484
I took Oliver Queen's arm

684
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,119
In this very spot.

685
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,890
Well, then let me go,

686
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,092
And we'll see which one
of us is tougher:

687
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,293
Me or Queen.

688
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,929
I already know
the answer to that.

689
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,297
Ready the prisoner.

690
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,206
Sir.

691
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,146
We saw her trying to
sneak past the perimeter.

692
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,015
Sloppy.

693
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:15,018
The league of assassins
would be embarrassed.

694
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,720
What was your strategy here?

695
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,457
You really think you could
just turn up tonight...

696
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,426
Kill me?

697
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,295
No.

698
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,831
It was just my job
to distract you.

699
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,765
You're not Green Arrow.

700
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,033
You're just a punk
in a Halloween costume.

701
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,070
Funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

702
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,366
You want to fight
the Green Arrow?

703
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,634
I'm right here.

704
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,821
You convinced Rip to stay.

705
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,924
Actually, sending in
the cavalry was his idea.

706
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:10,967
Where's Mr. Queen?

707
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,474
Connor!

708
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,554
Ugh!

709
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,332
Cowards, all!

710
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,804
Oliver?

711
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:51,241
It's good to see you
again, Ray. Kendra.

712
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:53,109
Thanks for the assist.

713
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,711
So who's that?

714
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,213
His name is Grant Wilson.

715
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,749
Once upon a time,
his father, Slade,

716
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,684
Tried to ruin my life.

717
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,721
That's not a nice family.

718
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,523
That's good shooting, John.

719
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,365
It's Connor.

720
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,700
Either way,

721
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,603
It's Green Arrow.

722
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,414
We have a lot of work to do.

723
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,916
Grant Wilson did a good job

724
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,885
Of keeping the criminal element
in the city together.

725
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,554
Now, there will
be plenty of people

726
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,155
To fill the vacuum.

727
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,490
I feel like I should stay.

728
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,958
Before Ray left,

729
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,627
He told me why Rip
brought all of you together.

730
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,329
It's important, Sara.

731
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,630
I just hate the idea

732
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,066
Of leaving you here
to fix it alone.

733
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,569
I'm not alone.

734
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,676
Just... just be careful,
all right?

735
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,211
Well, you should know
better than most

736
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,648
I rarely ever am.

737
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,626
You watch his back.

738
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,729
Copy that.

739
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,799
Let's get to work.

740
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,443
All right, confidence.

741
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,912
Confidence.
Okay.

742
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,448
So, uh,
I think Rip might have

743
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,583
Some of that vodka
left in his cabinet.

744
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,086
And?

745
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,588
And...

746
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,757
Maybe we could get a drink?

747
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,958
Are you asking me out?

748
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,629
Yes? No.
I think so.

749
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,631
Is that okay?

750
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:58,568
Yeah, that...
that's totally okay,

751
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,703
Except that three months ago,

752
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,405
I was a completely
normal person

753
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,341
And now I'm a hawk goddess

754
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,776
Traveling through time,

755
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,112
Trying to avoid being killed
by an immortal psychopath

756
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:13,049
Who murdered the man
I was destined to be with.

757
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,851
So...

758
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,654
I'm sorry, Ray.
I...

759
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,155
I think my life's
complicated enough

760
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,458
Without throwing
whatever this is

761
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,427
Into the mix.

762
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:29,032
Yeah, totally understand.

763
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,401
If I was a reincarnated
Egyptian priestess,

764
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,836
I'd probably feel the same way.

765
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,675
I'm gonna go check
on Professor Stein.

766
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,380
Mm-hmm, yup.

767
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,715
All good here.

768
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:49,085
- Absolutely no problems.
- Everything okay here?

769
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:52,188
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, fine. You?

770
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,924
Oh, yeah, good. Good.
It's good.

771
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,694
Uh...

772
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,429
How much of that
did you hear?

773
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,498
Uh, enough.
I'm sorry.

774
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,567
Sorry too.

775
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,703
Wait, you knew that I...

776
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,137
- Yeah.
- yeah.

777
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,307
You're not that subtle.

778
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,842
She would've picked me,
by the way.

779
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,577
Keep telling yourself that.

780
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,513
She would've.

781
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,253
I'm just working on
determining

782
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,321
Our next destination.

783
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,123
I've considered your
suggesting of hell,

784
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,325
But I think I'll give it
a miss for the time being.

785
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,063
I just wanted to
say thank you

786
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,734
For sending the team
to back me up.

787
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,303
As it turns out,
you were right.

788
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,306
That must've been
hard to say.

789
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,373
Of late I've discovered

790
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,909
That I still have
a lot to learn, I admit.

791
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,280
Including the fact
that every future

792
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,749
Is worth fighting for.

793
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,054
That said...

794
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,589
This mission is
going to continue

795
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,224
To present us with
difficult choices,

796
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:05,595
And I need to know that
you are a member of this team.

797
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,330
I guess so.

798
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,536
All right, Gideon,
let's see if these repairs

799
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,938
That Martin, Ray, and Jax made
are up to scratch.

800
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,473
<i>As far as I can tell,
Ms. Saunders</i>

801
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,308
<i>Did most of the work,
while the two gentlemen</i>

802
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,777
<i>Competed for...
just get us out of here.</i>

803
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,944
Please, Gideon.

804
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,385
I'm gonna miss this place.

805
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,122
Yeah, they really seemed
like your kind of people.

806
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,592
I don't know who
my people are anymore.

807
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,028
So where to next, Captain?

808
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,396
Well, the beauty
of this mission is that

809
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,499
The real question
is not where, but when.

810
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,668
In which case,
I suggest that we next hit

811
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,404
Savage when
he least expects it.
