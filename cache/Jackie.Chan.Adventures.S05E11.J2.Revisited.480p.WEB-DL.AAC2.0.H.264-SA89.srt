1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,704
Ah. No dragons,
no demons, no worries.

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,139
I hear ya, t.

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,676
Complete dullsville.
Worst vacation ever.

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,512
Jade, uncle and I
are going snorkeling.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,047
Guess I'll go too.

6
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,616
Maybe I can
find some sunken
treasure or something.

7
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,953
Um, why don't you
stay on shore with tohru?

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,493
My feet could
use coat of sunblock.

9
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,563
No offense,
but I'd rather
kiss a sand crab.

10
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,900
Check it out!
Kung fu frisbee!
Hee-yaa!

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,905
-Huh?
-(Chuckles) Little help?

12
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,407
(Groaning)

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,877
(Grunting)

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,212
Jade?

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,447
(Groaning)

16
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,154
(Gasps)

17
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,321
(Screams)

18
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,860
Jade! You weren't
supposed to...

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,064
Oh, why do I bother?

20
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,332
I knew this wasn't
really a vacation.

21
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,968
So, what's the 411
on the big blue marble?

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,004
No marble.

23
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:17,142
One half of
the arcanum of chi created
by ancient wizard madjo.

24
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,545
When reunited
with its other half,

25
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:25,784
it becomes a powerful relic,
increasing any chi spell,
ten-fold.

26
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,454
(Grunts) Got it!

27
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,688
-(Rumbling)
-(Gasps)

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,062
(Roaring)

29
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,163
-Bad day!
-Bad day!

30
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,231
Bad day!

31
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,366
(Roaring)

32
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,172
Ancient chi master
must have
cast protection spell.

33
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,841
-What was your first clue?
-(Both screaming)

34
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,310
Uncle!
I'm short-handed!

35
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,879
(Both screaming)

36
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,115
(Chanting)

37
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,451
Uh-oh.
Blowfish waterlogged.

38
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,153
(Roaring)

39
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,422
Jade! Uncle!

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,996
(Exclaims)

41
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,264
(Grunts)

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,501
(Roars)

43
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,905
(Both gasp)

44
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,274
(Panting)

45
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:59,077
-Uncle Jackie!
-(Coughing) Jade, wait!

46
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,282
(Screams)

47
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,128
(Roaring)

48
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,096
(Gasps)

49
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,232
Now this is a vacation.

50
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,140
Uh, okay if I sit here?

51
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,316
An alternative location
for your posterior
is advisable.

52
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,187
(Laughing)

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,631
Jade: I think
this belongs to you.

54
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,499
-Thanks, Jade.
-Tough day?

55
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,235
More like every day.

56
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,170
I don't fit
in with anyone.

57
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,771
I'm such a freakoid.

58
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,573
If you wanna
meet some real freakoids,

59
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,814
Uncle: Orb half
was hidden in watery,
cold location

60
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,617
representing yin chi.

61
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:16,054
Other half must be
in earthy, hot location,
representing Yang.

62
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,992
Location spell
will reveal exact whereabouts.

63
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,661
Tohru, begin!

64
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,364
Jackie's the world's
most kick-butt archeologist.

65
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,767
Uncle's a chi wizard
and the big guy's tohru,
uncle's apprentice.

66
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,605
My research suggests
the final ingredient
is essence of ginseng.

67
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,975
(Groans)

68
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,945
(Sneezes)

69
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,382
(Groans) I will never
be a chi wizard.

70
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:48,487
A chi wizard must learn
from defeats as well
as victories, tohru.

71
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,523
(Sneezes)

72
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,558
Aw, gross!

73
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,994
Hi, unc. Got a tissue?

74
00:04:55,996 --> 00:05:01,066
Aiya! Jade knows uncle
does not like being spied on!

75
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,769
I was just giving my friend
Jimmy the vip tour.

76
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,305
Sorry. The smoke made me...

77
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,074
(Sneezes)

78
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,942
(All gasp)

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,446
-Got it!
-(Uncle exclaims)

80
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:19,051
Arcanum,
ancient magical relic,
not pop fly!

81
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,919
Come, uncle.

82
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,922
We will take
the orb to section 13
for safe keeping.

83
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,059
It was nice
to meet you, Jimmy,
and good catch.

84
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,796
Is uncle always that cranky?

85
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,199
No. He is in a particularly
good mood today.

86
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,636
-(Hissing)
-Huh?

87
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,037
(Rapid footsteps)

88
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,440
(Gasps)

89
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,143
Unless uncle Jackie
went spandex,

90
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,145
looks like section 13's
got a thief.

91
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,085
Whoa! Whoa! A chi blast?

92
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,886
(Chanting)

93
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,562
(Gasp) Time portal!

94
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,301
(Screaming)

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,803
(Grunting)

96
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,507
Whoa. New and improved.

97
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,576
We gotta be talkin'
the future here.

98
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,150
(Grunts)

99
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,418
(Both gasp)

100
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,186
-Jade?
-What are you doing here?

101
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,123
This is my time, duh!
What's your story?

102
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,991
Some guy snagged
the arcanum of chi.

103
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,761
I chased him through
a time portal and,
babamo, here I am.

104
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,928
Iso!

105
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,499
(Beeping)

106
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,835
-No sign of him now...
-Time out. Who's iso?

107
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,205
Only <i> numero uno</i>
on section 13's
most wanted list.

108
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,107
So why are we standing here?

109
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,842
Let's go track down
the bad guy.

110
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,444
Two jades
are better than one.

111
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,980
Love to, but no can do.

112
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,148
No can what?

113
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,785
Captain black's
put me on desk duty

114
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,520
for "unauthorized
use of a magical item,

115
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,588
"resulting in destruction
of public property."

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,492
(Scoffs) Like he never blew up
a donut shop with
a dragon talisman before.

117
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,428
Hmm. No prob.

118
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,297
I'll do some solo
re-con until you can
come out to play.

119
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,266
So, where does iso hang?

120
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,836
Intel suggests his lair
is somewhere
in the pavilion mall area...

121
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,205
Wait, what am I saying?

122
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,508
If captain black finds
you here, I'll wind up
a section 13 janitor.

123
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,410
We have to send you back
to your own time.

124
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,313
Jade, we brought
your favorite,

125
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,215
triple black bean burritos.

126
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,983
Thanks.

127
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,785
Time hoppin' gives me
the major munchies.

128
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,120
All: Jade?

129
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,557
Aiya! Young Jade
and older Jade?

130
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,460
Uncle has deja vu
all over again.

131
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,162
Jade, explain.

132
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,598
Both: Iso stole our half
of the arcanum of chi
in the past

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,999
by using a time portal spell.

134
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,702
So I followed him through when
he escaped back to the future!

135
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,872
No... please,
one Jade at a time.

136
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:58,376
Aiya! Why would iso
go to so much trouble,
unless...

137
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:02,280
Unless he has discovered
the location of the other
half of the arcanum.

138
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,615
Jimmy: Sensei?

139
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,651
-Jimmy?
-Jade?

140
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,487
Uh, how come there's a...

141
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,654
Which one is the...

142
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,922
Both: Time portal spell.

143
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,024
But what are you doing here?

144
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,628
I'm tohru's apprentice,
he's a full chi wizard now.

145
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,799
Way to go, big t!
And you too, Jimmy.

146
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,034
I owe it all to you
for introducing us.

147
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,603
Captain black:
Agent chan!

148
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,837
Hide! Now!

149
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,842
Gentlemen. Jade,
I need you asap.

150
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,578
Yes, sir. I'm aware of
iso's recent break-in and...

151
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,249
Iso? Here?
Nothing unusual popped
on the security grid.

152
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,018
I'll organize a team
to make a sweep
immediately.

153
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,054
Almost forgot.
Copy and collate these.

154
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,390
Yes, sir.

155
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,927
Jade... Jade?
Where did she go?

156
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,495
Shopping for a bad guy.

157
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,344
<i>Hello. May I interest you</i>
<i>in a beautiful</i>
<i>handmade mirror, today?</i>

158
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,547
-No, thank you.
-(Whirring)

159
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,849
Look out!

160
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,318
A hologram hard sell.
Freaky!

161
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,453
Whoa! Jade, check it out.

162
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,722
The mirror lady's
totally virtual.

163
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,193
Come on, Jade, it's go time,
as in you have to go back
to your own time.

164
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,063
-What about finding iso?
-Not our problem.

165
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,968
What happened to you?
You used to rock!

166
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,836
Think I like
pushing papers all day?

167
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,407
I don't, but this is my job
and captain black is my boss.

168
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,142
You have to grow up
sometime, Jade.

169
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,944
Speak for yourself!

170
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,580
(Beeps)

171
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,414
-Uh-oh. What's happening?
-(Alarm blaring)

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,949
I'm not sure.

173
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,317
(Both screaming)

174
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,319
(Loud thud)

175
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,486
(Door opens)

176
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,754
Both: Phew!

177
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,126
Spell books, potions,
major funky mojo.

178
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,295
-This has to be...
-Both: Iso's lair!

179
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,301
(Blowing)

180
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,670
-The arcanum!
-(Both gasp)

181
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,672
Both: Whoa!

182
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,307
(Grunts)

183
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,476
Iso: This must be
my lucky day.

184
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,946
What a bargain,
two jades for
the price of one.

185
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,282
(Screams)

186
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,889
Hee-yaa!

187
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,229
(Groans)

188
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,731
(Grunts) Timber!

189
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,000
(Groans)

190
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,969
Both: Nice work.

191
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,420
-Maybe we lost him.
-(Explosion)

192
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,921
(People screaming)

193
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,524
Maybe not.

194
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,426
Hop on.

195
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,135
(Chanting)

196
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,511
Dark chi coming up fast.

197
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,382
(Screaming)

198
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,617
(Roaring)

199
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,320
(Gasps)

200
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,926
-We can't out run it.
-I have an idea. Follow me!

201
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,628
(Roaring)

202
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,865
I sure hope you know
what we're doing
'cause I don't!

203
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,233
Climb!

204
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,601
(Screaming)

205
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,174
(Screaming)

206
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,676
Emergency exit!

207
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,453
I am very proud of you both.

208
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,588
The time portal spell
is ready.

209
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,991
So it's save the day
and don't let the door
hit you on the way out?

210
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,727
-Harsh.
-Captain black: Jade!

211
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,794
(Grunts)

212
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,532
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

213
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,103
-Well,
it was nothing really.
-You're too modest.

214
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:22,307
Who else could destroy
an entire shopping mall
in a single afternoon?

215
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,878
Captain black, believe me,
I know Jade does not always
follow the rules, but...

216
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,246
I'm sorry, Jackie.

217
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,617
Jade, you're like family,
but enough is enough.

218
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,620
Turn in your badge,
you're fired.

219
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,156
-You can't do that!
-Jade?

220
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,061
(Stuttering)
- I'm sending you both home,
immediately.

221
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,262
(Sighs)

222
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,341
Jade, wait!
Whoa!

223
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,943
-Jimmy, what are you...
-Jade, just listen.

224
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,482
I figured out a spell
to locate the other half
of the orb.

225
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,218
(Chanting)

226
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,490
Whoa! That's eagle's peak,

227
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,659
a dormant volcano
just outside the city!

228
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,294
Jimmy, you're a genius!

229
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,229
You up for a little
rock climbing?

230
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,765
Me? I'm not a field agent.

231
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,433
But if I were,

232
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:26,604
and I needed to
do something major
to win back my job...

233
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,073
I knew there was a reason
we became friends.

234
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,077
Jade, we have to talk.

235
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,381
Shouldn't you be hurtling back
through the time continuum
about now?

236
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,751
Doesn't matter,
if you'll excuse me,
I have to pack up my stuff.

237
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,987
Okay, be all mopey,

238
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,256
but I know where
to find the other half
of the arcanum.

239
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,692
-Whoa!
-I'm listening.

240
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,163
(Grunting)

241
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,105
Hello, beautiful.

242
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,950
(Screeching)

243
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,553
That madjo wizard
- must have cast a protection
spell over this half too!

244
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,156
Duh!

245
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,558
(Grunts) Whoa!
That pigeon
needs a manicure.

246
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,262
We are so outta here!

247
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,931
-Repel!
-(Both screaming)

248
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,535
Between those boulders!

249
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,437
(Screeching)

250
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,611
I like the way you think.

251
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:45,250
Of course!
The other half of arcanum
was atop volcanic mountain!

252
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,087
Yang location,
earthy and hot!

253
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,788
Well done, uncle.

254
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,926
Uncle was not responsible.
Tohru?

255
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,661
-Actually it was...
-Jimmy: Me.

256
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,231
It took me over
10 years of research,

257
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,734
but now I'm going
to reap the rewards.

258
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,904
"Reap the rewards?"

259
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,505
Jimmy, what are you
talking about?

260
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,842
Actually, call me...
Iso!

261
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,678
(All gasp)

262
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,318
(Grunting)

263
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,589
(Chanting)

264
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:30,028
Aiya! Tohru, your apprentice
has been seduced by dark chi!

265
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,263
Oh, this is all my fault!

266
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,167
No, I owe it all to Jade.
She introduced us.

267
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,903
Both: Our bad.

268
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:43,174
Since I never fit in
with any cliques,
it's time to create my own!

269
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,009
(Chanting)

270
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,411
Whoa.

271
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,981
Go low!

272
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,950
(Grunting)

273
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,554
(Grunting)

274
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,393
(Screaming)

275
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,932
(Grunts)

276
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,202
Uncle! Do something!

277
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,239
The arcanum
is too powerful.

278
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,409
Must first find
Jimmy's weakness.

279
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:22,246
don't ever call me
Jimmy again.

280
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,748
Aiya!

281
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,687
Both: You thinking
what I'm thinking?

282
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,756
T, the time portal spell!
Need it!

283
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,624
(Grunting)

284
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,260
-Now?
-No time like the present!

285
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,201
Secure all exits!

286
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,571
don't worry, captain black.
I'm not going anywhere.

287
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,174
Once I level this dump,
no one will able to stop me.

288
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,043
(Chanting)

289
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,213
(Growling)

290
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,849
(Grunting)

291
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,817
He has an endless army
of isos.

292
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,587
-How do we stop him?
-Magic must defeat magic.

293
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,188
Hold the line.

294
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,299
Uh, excuse us, big t,
gotta talk to Jimmy,
it's kinda personal.

295
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,801
Tell me what scares
you the most.

296
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,904
Aw, I knew it!
You're just like all the rest.

297
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,374
Well, if you think
I'm gonna tell you how
to torture me, forget it.

298
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,010
-Seriously, we haven't
got time for this.
-Hey.

299
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,547
(Grunts)

300
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,420
Welcome to the future.
Come on.

301
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,823
(Grunting)

302
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,024
That's me.

303
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,730
-Do I rock, or what?
-What about me?

304
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,031
You're more like disco.

305
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,069
(Grunting)

306
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,503
(Chanting)

307
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,209
I'm the bad guy?

308
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,479
Way bad,
but you don't have to be.

309
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,615
Heights.
I'm afraid of heights.

310
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,952
Right. That's why you
didn't get your backpack
out of that tree.

311
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,122
Or climb eagle's peak
to grab the other half
of the orb.

312
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,558
Iso tricked us into doing
his dirty work for him!

313
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,326
(Grunting)

314
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,363
Talismans!
Get your talismans!

315
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,516
(Meowing)

316
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,887
(Chanting)

317
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,393
(Grunting)

318
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,495
Hee-yaa!

319
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,466
(Screaming)

320
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,734
(All gasp)

321
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,439
Got it!

322
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,941
Huh?

323
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,745
Iso: (Shuddering)
Put me down!

324
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,413
If you insist.

325
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,915
(Screaming)

326
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,220
I may be a freakoid now,

327
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,957
but there's no way
I'm turning into
a mega-loser like you.

328
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,497
Jade, I'm a big enough man
to admit when I am wrong.

329
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,534
Your old job's waiting
for you at section 13.

330
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,868
Yes, sir!

331
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,972
We won't let you down, cb.
I mean, she won't.

332
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,674
I know you won't.

333
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:41,212
This is such a relief,
the filing was really
beginning to pile up.

334
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,817
Even with iso in custody,

335
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,222
I believe it will be safer
to destroy the arcanum
back in your time, Jade.

336
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,057
Thanks for the reboot.

337
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,127
Guess I just needed
a little kick in the butt
to start kicking butt again.

338
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,297
No prob. Hey,
maybe I'll come back
and visit sometime.

339
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,731
All: No!

340
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,036
Aiya! Half orb missing!

341
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,739
Two halves are better
than one, I always say.

342
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,610
Jade, explain.

343
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,751
<i>Hey, Jackie, do you ever wish</i>
<i>you could see into the future?</i>

344
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:25,690
Oh, yes. I really hope
I can have this kind of power.

345
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,125
I can see the future.

346
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,961
I can predict what happens.

347
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,597
Then, I guess,
I believe I can save
a lot of people.
