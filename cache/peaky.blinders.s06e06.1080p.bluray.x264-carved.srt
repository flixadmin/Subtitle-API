1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,761
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

3
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,001
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

4
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:10,041
<i>are your own responsibility.</i>

5
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,097
<i>Since my mother
passed away four years ago,</i>

6
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,401
<i>Tommy and I
haven't even spoken.</i>

7
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,681
I'm very much looking forward

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,857
to working with you again,
Michael.

9
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:19,081
That, my friend, is
the finest opium in the world.

10
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,201
Why would you sell?

11
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,721
<i>The Irish
are being difficult.</i>

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,081
The Italians are not an option.

13
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:25,001
- You're going to America?
- To Canada,

14
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,337
to collect payment
for the shipment.

15
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,641
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

16
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,801
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

17
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,321
<i>Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.</i>

18
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:35,481
She's gone, Tommy.
She's gone.

19
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,721
A daughter lost. A son found.

20
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,761
This is my son.
They call him Duke.

21
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:43,521
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

22
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,441
- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

23
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,041
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby.

24
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:49,961
<i>And you are going to give us
his brother.</i>

25
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,481
What are
Michael's real intentions

26
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,601
towards me, Gina?

27
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,441
And if you lie, I will know.

28
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,961
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

29
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,217
<i>It was the ambitions
and strategies of one man</i>

30
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,321
<i>that caused this.</i>

31
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,881
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

32
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,601
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

33
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,761
I want to see my wife first.

34
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,441
After you've fucked your wife,

35
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,921
you're going to kill a man,
right?

36
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,641
The smoke
from your daughter's funeral

37
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,921
is still in your clothes...

38
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:05,041
...and you slept with someone.

39
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,321
Not just someone.

40
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,041
The enemy.

41
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,401
Every enemy we ever had
in one woman.

42
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,201
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I...

43
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:25,041
You're not so good at lying
any more, Tommy.

44
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,601
These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

45
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,321
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

46
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,161
I need to know
where you will go.

47
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,401
See? You just accept it.

48
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,521
You don't fight it.

49
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,521
You are cursed, Tommy.

50
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,161
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

51
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,201
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

52
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:03,521
A curse never to be lifted.

53
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,361
I will be away, Lizzie.

54
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,601
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where...

55
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,321
Always gone, always away.

56
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,441
Well, now your rings are gone,

57
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,721
your rings are away.

58
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,241
I'm already packed.

59
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,521
Now leave me
to say goodbye to Ruby.

60
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,121
I have to go away for a bit,
Charlie.

61
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:53,561
Look at me.

62
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,561
Hey. Look at me.

63
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,241
Mum already told me
she's leaving...

64
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,121
...and she told me why.

65
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,441
Mum, where are you going?

66
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,561
A hotel.

67
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,521
And then your father
will get me a house.

68
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,841
Mum, I'll come with you.

69
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,561
I'd rather be with you.

70
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,721
Wherever it is.

71
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,521
You're not my mum...

72
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,881
...but you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

73
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,521
He's never here.

74
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,601
I'd be on my own here.

75
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,401
Oh, Charles, love...

76
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,721
...I don't think your father
would allow that.

77
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,561
You can go.

78
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:09,361
You can go, son.

79
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,521
I know a good place.

80
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,121
Lizzie,
I'll arrange that place.

81
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,881
And, Charlie,
you can take him, eh?

82
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:21,681
They have stables
at this new place.

83
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,961
After a while,
he'll... he'll listen to you.

84
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,161
He'll forget about Ruby.

85
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,841
That's how horses are.

86
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,921
And you'll be here all alone.

87
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:37,521
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

88
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,361
This place I've bought

89
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,361
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there.

90
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,641
Dad...

91
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,721
...where will you go?

92
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,681
This is
the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

93
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,281
We have
a very good relationship

94
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,721
with the BSA factory
in Armoury Road.

95
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:09,161
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

96
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,961
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

97
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,121
For what purpose?

98
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,921
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

99
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,641
When men come to us
with bad intentions,

100
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,601
the family come together.

101
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,881
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

102
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,481
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

103
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,481
You're going to be a general...

104
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,321
...some day.

105
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,201
So, I need to ask you
some questions.

106
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,121
What have you ever fired?

107
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,881
Shotgun.

108
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,721
Pistol.

109
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,001
22.

110
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,121
What have you ever killed?

111
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,321
Few rabbits.

112
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,441
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

113
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,401
Arthur tells me

114
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,897
when they were taking care
of some business

115
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,401
at the betting shop,

116
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,281
you ran away.

117
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:22,601
It was unfair.

118
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,681
Fairness is not
a soldier's concern.

119
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,921
You do what you do.

120
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,641
I already have done.

121
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,921
Fair and square.

122
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,881
I have killed a man.

123
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,401
Tommy's always right.

124
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,441
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

125
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,441
In the Black Country.

126
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,841
My mother was dying.

127
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,801
And the orderly
wouldn't give her a bed

128
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:02,801
cos she was a Gypsy-
she had no insurance.

129
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,161
She never saw the sunrise.

130
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,321
Nor did that man
who denied her.

131
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,681
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

132
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,401
Can you keep a secret?

133
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,041
I know, brother.

134
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,761
I know.

135
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,521
I know.

136
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,681
I stole your keys.

137
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:59,041
Tuberculoma.

138
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,601
In your brain.

139
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,281
Yeah.

140
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,281
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

141
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,961
Fuck you, Tommy.

142
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,641
I don't need anyone to know,
Arthur.

143
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,761
No, you don't, do you?

144
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,001
You don't need anything,
do you?

145
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,361
No, I don't need anything.

146
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,481
I don't need anything.

147
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:28,121
How long have we been dead for,
eh?

148
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,081
You and me, how long?

149
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:31,961
At least now
I'll have a certificate.

150
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,601
Wherever it is,

151
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,001
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

152
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,161
- Fuck's sake.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:46,561
All them bullets that missed.

154
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,041
It's funny, Arthur.

155
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,041
It's funny is what it is.

156
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,721
So don't you fucking weep.

157
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,281
Weep!

158
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,321
When everyone
is taken care of financially,

159
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,241
I will take myself away.
On my own.

160
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,281
I don't want anyone...

161
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,841
...anyone who may
or may not...

162
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,401
...love me...

163
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,441
...to have to see me crawl...

164
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,441
...or grow insane and helpless.

165
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,721
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

166
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:34,681
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

167
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,161
What about Lizzie?

168
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,081
I have some papers
I need you to sign

169
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,481
on behalf of the company.

170
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,921
Told Lizzie?

171
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,801
I'm working
with the housing minister.

172
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,801
I will be allocating contracts,

173
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,281
construction contracts
worth £10 million.

174
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,121
You haven't told Lizzie?

175
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,961
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

176
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,697
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

177
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,481
Fuck you and your contracts!

178
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,641
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue

179
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,081
to earn money.

180
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,761
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing
it because it's a good thing.

181
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,081
- Building houses.
- Oh...

182
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,801
Yeah, for ordinary
working people...

183
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,561
Oh, yeah, good for you.
Fuckin'...

184
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,441
...in the interests
of a fairer future.

185
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,881
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

186
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,681
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

187
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,481
Oh, five fucking million?

188
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:29,961
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

189
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:33,681
And that will be my legacy.

190
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,001
Instead of me,
there will be money.

191
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,241
Because for most
of the people

192
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:40,481
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

193
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,201
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

194
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:45,441
Is that all you think you are,
eh?

195
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:46,601
Hmm?

196
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,441
Stand up.

197
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,481
You heard me.

198
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,641
Stand up.

199
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:58,761
On your feet.

200
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,601
- On your fucking feet.
- Arthur...

201
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,001
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.

202
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,801
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

203
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,321
No!

204
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,481
No.

205
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,921
You hear me?

206
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,041
Enough.

207
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,641
Enough!

208
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,241
Now you know.

209
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,201
You tell no-one else...

210
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,001
...until I am gone.

211
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,681
Until you're gone, yeah?

212
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,601
When the time comes,
I'll call you.

213
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,081
I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

214
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,601
Fuck your wagon!

215
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,041
You light the flame.

216
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:56,721
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

217
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,601
Get drunk.

218
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,561
Rake the ashes
for silver and gold.

219
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:03,321
Fuck you!

220
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,201
And your fucking plans!

221
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,801
That time,
I did let you fucking win.

222
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:32,761
John...

223
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,241
Fuckin' you, John.

224
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,001
Fuckin' both of you.

225
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,801
Arthur...

226
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,241
Arthur.

227
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,401
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

228
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,681
Come here.

229
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,241
Come here.

230
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,201
Come here.

231
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,641
Let me see your eyes.

232
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,401
I'm clean, man.

233
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:06,081
The dragon's fucking gone.

234
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:10,001
Thanks to you. Fucking...
Fucking thanks to you.

235
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,521
You all right?

236
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:39,921
Come on.

237
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,241
Fucking...

238
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,161
Hey, I'm still fucking here.

239
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:45,721
Pull yourself together,
come on.

240
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,041
We have work to do.

241
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,161
Come on!

242
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,841
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

243
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,521
Yes. We want Billy.

244
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,361
Sit down, Billy.

245
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,801
Thank you for inviting me,
Mr Shelby.

246
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,641
Good to see you again, Billy.

247
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,401
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

248
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,001
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about it.

249
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,881
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

250
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,521
Now, we are all gathered...

251
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,041
...and those...

252
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:17,801
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

253
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,881
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn it.

254
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,201
I heard "tachipen".

255
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,241
Truth.

256
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,881
You said something
about the truth.

257
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,881
Truth. The truth is...

258
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,561
...I called men here
that I can trust...

259
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,521
...because
I will be going away.

260
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,121
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

261
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,081
which left Liverpool
ten days ago.

262
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,001
Payment from who?

263
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:45,561
South Boston Irish, Finn.

264
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:47,841
Bootleggers.

265
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,681
Are you going alone?

266
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:55,401
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

267
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,721
Michael will be there.

268
00:17:58,121 --> 00:17:59,241
Michael is family.

269
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:02,841
Michael will be my guarantee
of safety.

270
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:06,201
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

271
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,721
I need you
to go to Arrow House.

272
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,361
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good.

273
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,481
And there are things
that need removing.

274
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,601
I need men that I can trust.

275
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,081
There is cash,
there are valuables.

276
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,961
There is information
about important people

277
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,001
that has more value than gold.

278
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,041
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

279
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:28,521
which need digging up

280
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,481
before the contractors
start moving earth.

281
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,841
Isiah, you will be in charge.

282
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,281
In Arrow House,
there is a wine cellar.

283
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,281
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

284
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,081
that are worth more than
a man's life.

285
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:44,201
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

286
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,841
...be like a farewell party.

287
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,201
Are you ready for the party,
son?

288
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,961
Tachipen.

289
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,641
The fucking truth again.

290
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,401
What truth?

291
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:02,041
You'll need shovels,
you'll need boxes,

292
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,321
and you'll take the bones
to Mr Patches

293
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,961
to put in the furnace
at Greenham's.

294
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,001
Got it?

295
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,841
Right. Any questions?

296
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:13,401
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

297
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,041
No, Billy.

298
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,761
All the fun will be laid on
for you.

299
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,841
So, when is the party, Tom?

300
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,481
Mr Shelby.

301
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,881
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

302
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,481
You mean this Sunday?

303
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,321
Yeah.

304
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,441
And while you're
digging fucking holes,

305
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,401
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

306
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:45,561
It's our wedding anniversary.

307
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,801
Right.

308
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,081
Oh, and Finn,

309
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,801
by the way,

310
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,441
please explain to, erm,
what's her name?

311
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,841
- Mary.
- Mary?

312
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,321
- Yes.
- Is it Mary?

313
00:19:56,441 --> 00:20:00,001
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

314
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,761
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

315
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,761
Have a look - Shelby.

316
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:04,921
Look.

317
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,121
This means you own the watch,

318
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,961
the watch doesn't own you.

319
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:13,041
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

320
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,721
Have a whiskey.

321
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,921
Enjoy the party, boys.

322
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:35,761
Want a drink, baby?

323
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,121
No.

324
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,441
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

325
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:44,121
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

326
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:54,281
Leave it.

327
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,281
Yeah?

328
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,001
Good.

329
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,081
That's good.

330
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,401
Look, I've got to go.

331
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:22,241
Good news, Michael.

332
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,441
Listen.

333
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,961
That was our informant
in Birmingham.

334
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,961
The Shelby men will
all be together on Sunday.

335
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,881
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

336
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,841
at the bar
of the Garrison Tavern.

337
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:44,241
As I recall,

338
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,441
the Shelby table is right next
to the windows, correct?

339
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,121
Every table's a Shelby table.

340
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,601
Yes, but...

341
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:54,161
...maybe our people could just
drive by and...

342
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,561
...shoot Arthur
through the glass

343
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,321
without even getting
out of the car.

344
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,441
Michael...

345
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,961
...we've talked about this -
there's no other choice.

346
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:07,601
This business is between me
and Tommy.

347
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:11,161
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

348
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,081
Arthur will come after you.

349
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,841
He has to die, too.

350
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:20,801
If Arthur's in a bar,
he'll be drunk.

351
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:23,561
Or worse.

352
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,561
At least he'll die
without pain.

353
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:35,121
Who'll do the killing?

354
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,921
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

355
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,121
Connor has connections.

356
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,561
They made a deal.

357
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,241
A favour in return for guns.

358
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,241
But, Michael...

359
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,081
...whilst the assassin's
in this city...

360
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,041
...Tommy has a son.

361
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,121
He's a kid.

362
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,601
Kids grow up.

363
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,561
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

364
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,921
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

365
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,641
Do you want
a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

366
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,521
I know about the new boy.

367
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,321
I've decided that
the illegitimate son

368
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,401
is not a threat. My decision.

369
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,441
OnlyArthur.

370
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:27,801
Michael, baby...

371
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,521
...everything's been agreed.

372
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,121
Everybody wants
the same things.

373
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,801
How many men do you think
they killed with bullets

374
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,481
and blades?

375
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,721
That's how Tommy became king.

376
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,641
And in three days' time...

377
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:54,641
...that's how
you will become king.

378
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,961
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead anyway.

379
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,481
On Sunday, we'll just...

380
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,001
...give them what they want.

381
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:37,721
Oswald was called away.
He sent me instead.

382
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:42,081
Actually, that's not true.

383
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,321
I sent Oswald away
and elected myself

384
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,841
to be his representative.

385
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,721
What was it you wanted?

386
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,161
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill

387
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,881
before Parliament.

388
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,921
You'll need to start drawing up
a list

389
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,721
of all your land-owning
families with gambling debts,

390
00:24:58,841 --> 00:24:59,961
drug addictions,

391
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,081
any other drain
on their resources.

392
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:05,081
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

393
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,881
using Treasury bonds.

394
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,641
Thomas, why don't we fuck here,

395
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:10,161
on these benches?

396
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,601
Right now.

397
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:16,361
We wouldn't be the first.

398
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,041
I hear your wife left you.

399
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:29,961
Over the last few months,

400
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,841
I've had some associates
of mine...

401
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:36,441
...break into
some of your pals' houses.

402
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,081
They stole paperwork.

403
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:41,081
Letters, bills,
bank statements...

404
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:43,201
Are you not upset?

405
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:50,441
This is a list
of all land-owning families

406
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,081
facing foreclosure.

407
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:59,321
And to answer your question...

408
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,921
...no.

409
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,921
No, I'm not upset that
my wife left me.

410
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:13,761
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

411
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,441
But you'll have
to cross the floor

412
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:18,001
cos I refuse to fuck
on Tory benches.

413
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,121
Mr Shelby...

414
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,681
...I was going to have
this delivered to you,

415
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,361
but I decided to bring it
in person.

416
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,321
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

417
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,521
It's in Berlin.

418
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,161
We are going to get married

419
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,961
in the presence
of the Führer himself.

420
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:02,281
Were you having fun?

421
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,721
Making paper aeroplanes.

422
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,641
I'm afraid, er...

423
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:10,721
...I have business.
I will be in Canada.

424
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,641
Pity.

425
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,161
Oh, and, er...

426
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,801
...the other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

427
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,481
was to tell you that,
after our wedding,

428
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:29,441
you must understand,
Mr Shelby...

429
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:34,041
...that if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

430
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:35,841
I will have you killed.

431
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:40,921
Come, Diana.

432
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,201
Just think...

433
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:49,521
...very soon, crumbling
old institutions like this one

434
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,841
will be swept away

435
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,041
and become a thing
of ancient memory.

436
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:56,321
Fly safe.

437
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:06,201
Be careful with this baby.

438
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:11,801
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

439
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:33,161
Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

440
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:36,321
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

441
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,617
We are hearing so many rumours

442
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,081
about what is happening
to the house.

443
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:43,001
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is,

444
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,681
you don't ask questions.

445
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:50,801
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

446
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,921
OK, let's find
these bottles of wine

447
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,641
worth more than a man's life.

448
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:52,881
There's only one guest here.

449
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,481
The rest of the rooms are free

450
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,561
if you want to use them
while you wait.

451
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:59,641
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

452
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,681
There was a storm last night.

453
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:05,001
Last of a hurricane.
Boats all came in.

454
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,841
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

455
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:13,081
Then your friend is dead.

456
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:16,401
Wind was like...

457
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,601
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

458
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:20,441
My name is not fucking Mickey,

459
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,081
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

460
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:28,761
Another one.

461
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,041
<i>There will be a war...</i>

462
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:45,201
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

463
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:48,481
Which one I cannot tell.

464
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,441
<i>You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.</i>

465
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,801
<i>Where the fuck were you?</i>

466
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,321
<i>She's gone Tommy.
She's gone.</i>

467
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:59,441
<i>The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.</i>

468
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:02,481
<i>Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.</i>

469
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,561
<i>How long?</i>

470
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,121
<i>Perhaps 18 months.</i>

471
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:09,561
<i>I will change.
And change for good.</i>

472
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:11,761
<i>What is this good
that you have become?</i>

473
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,441
<i>Kill...</i>

474
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:15,041
...and kill.

475
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:49,721
What's going on?

476
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:55,601
What the fuck is this?

477
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,721
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

478
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,161
It is now you're here.

479
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,001
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

480
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,761
In the kitchen.

481
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,041
All the booze
is in the kitchen.

482
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:06,281
All right.

483
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:23,361
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

484
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,921
but God steps in and says,

485
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,121
"No, this is grievous,
mindless evil!"

486
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,561
Where is he, Jeremiah?

487
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:33,801
In heaven, looking down.

488
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:40,481
God tells us
that blood is given to him

489
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,761
from us.

490
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:44,761
Why don't you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

491
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,761
Well, there's no longer
any power

492
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,401
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

493
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,601
Why not?
What do you mean?

494
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:51,801
What happened?

495
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,577
I thought there were
gonna be girls here.

496
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:55,601
Who need girls

497
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,121
when you're in a house
bound for hell?

498
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,561
Fuck d'ya mean?

499
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,601
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

500
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,521
Fuck!

501
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,001
Fuck!

502
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,561
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

503
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,361
It's got a death sentence.

504
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,561
I don't want a drink.

505
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:29,881
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

506
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,561
- Billy?
- Yeah?

507
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:33,441
Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

508
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:35,281
before you start digging them
back up.

509
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,361
What the fuck does that mean?

510
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,761
I'm a fucking Shelby.

511
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,601
So am I.

512
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:08,081
He's here.

513
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,041
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

514
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,681
Charge is set to blow
in 30 minutes.

515
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,761
That's at exactly 16.20.

516
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,921
Everybody got that?

517
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,601
I'll do it.

518
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,281
This is between me and Tommy.

519
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,081
I'll do it with my own hand.

520
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,321
I'll come with you.

521
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:20,241
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

522
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,361
Easy.

523
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,681
It's just a pity
you didn't have the guts

524
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,801
to shoot him face to face.

525
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,681
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

526
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:52,841
She always said
it won't be a bullet

527
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,321
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

528
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,521
Hey, lads.

529
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,321
Over by the bridge.

530
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,641
Big, big fish.

531
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,681
Poisson. Grande.

532
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,241
Go on.

533
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:15,281
Take the gun, Finn.

534
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:20,121
Arthur says if you don't do it,

535
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:22,281
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

536
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,561
What the fuck do <i>you</i> know
about family?

537
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:26,681
You're not family.

538
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:30,121
You're the son
of a fucking whore!

539
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:35,121
Just take the gun and do it,
Finn.

540
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:37,561
Take the fucking gun.

541
00:38:46,281 --> 00:38:48,681
Now you have the gun, Finn,

542
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:50,041
you have the gun.

543
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,681
Use it on these fucks!

544
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,561
Argh!

545
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,961
Charlie Strong told me,

546
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,561
"When you give Finn the gun,

547
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,441
"make sure the first two
chambers are empty."

548
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,921
Good old Uncle Charlie.

549
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,441
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

550
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:46,841
By order of
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

551
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,961
I will come for you.

552
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:53,161
I will fucking come for you!

553
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:42,801
...That find me faulting them

554
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:46,441
who govern like dogs
in Garrison Lane.

555
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,961
Hear this, then came
Jesus forth

556
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,161
wearing the crown of thorns

557
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:52,841
and the purple robe,

558
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:56,521
and Pilate said,
"Behold the man,

559
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:57,881
"he is the man."

560
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,561
Not the Peaky Blinders,

561
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:04,521
we see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their...

562
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:13,961
Hmm.

563
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,681
Order your man to drop it.

564
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,081
Order him.

565
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,681
Empty the fucking gun.
Tell him.

566
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,521
You all right, Charlie?

567
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,081
All good here, Arthur.

568
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,201
Let's move.

569
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:45,201
Take you out to the street
cos I don't wanna spoil my pub.

570
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:58,041
You'd shoot us like dogs?

571
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:02,081
No. I don't shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

572
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:57,321
Fuck! Fuck!

573
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,601
Fuck!

574
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:21,361
Oh, Lord!

575
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:26,361
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

576
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:05,801
Kids, no, come here.

577
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:07,081
I said, come here!

578
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,241
What have I told you
about running off?

579
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,441
Don't pick up things. Don't.

580
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:13,841
Come here, come on.

581
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:23,081
Emily! Emily, come on.

582
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,481
If you get lost in the fog,

583
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:26,281
the Peaky Blinders
will get you.

584
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:30,441
Jeremiah.

585
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:35,761
Let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

586
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:53,561
Fuck!

587
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:58,201
Fuck!

588
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,921
Come here.

589
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,681
Shh... Shh...

590
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:17,361
Breathe. Breathe.

591
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:26,041
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

592
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:30,441
She was myAunt Polly.

593
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:33,721
MyAunt Polly.

594
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,281
Vengeance is for the...

595
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,921
Not in Small Heath,
it ain't.

596
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:51,801
Rest in peace, Pol.

597
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,081
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

598
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,561
We're still in France.

599
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,321
OK.

600
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:15,441
I see him
coming out of the fog.

601
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:37,761
How was the flight?

602
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:42,041
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

603
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:43,601
Whiskey.

604
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:48,001
Hello, Michael.

605
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:50,521
Tommy.

606
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:01,321
Give me another.

607
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,521
We want you to take us

608
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:07,321
to where the opium
is being stored.

609
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:11,321
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

610
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:13,041
for the full amount.

611
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:15,521
$5 million.

612
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:18,921
$5 million.

613
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:20,961
Let's go.

614
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,401
I'll go with Tommy.

615
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:31,921
You boys follow behind.

616
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:42,201
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

617
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,521
Mum...

618
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:40,881
...it's done.

619
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:45,161
It's over.

620
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:49,441
And may God forgive me.

621
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:27,241
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

622
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,601
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

623
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:38,241
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

624
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,201
Goodbye, Michael.

625
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,721
Goodbye, Johnny.

626
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:56,561
You're a good man.

627
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:03,721
I'm gonna go look at the fog,
Tom.

628
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:11,161
Speak to me.

629
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:14,241
Speak to me, Michael.

630
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,001
You killed her.

631
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:20,521
Polly made her own choices,

632
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:21,801
- Michael.
- No...

633
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,241
No-one close to you

634
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,561
makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

635
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:30,161
Not Arthur,

636
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:33,241
not me, not Ada.

637
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:37,841
We can't escape you.

638
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,521
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

639
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:48,761
Polly was half of me.

640
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:52,081
Still visits me in my dreams.

641
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:56,081
She'll visit me no more.

642
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,441
I have no limitations.

643
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:19,841
I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

644
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,041
Oh, yes, hello.

645
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:25,361
I also smell
the smell of tobacco,

646
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,041
which is forbidden
in my presence

647
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:28,321
for all except for one -

648
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:30,401
my new wife, Edna.

649
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,801
With the Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

650
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:37,961
I now own half of Boston, so...

651
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:42,521
...out of respect
for my restored authority...

652
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,721
...put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

653
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:50,281
Hello, Alfie.

654
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,801
I heard it was a good wedding.

655
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:54,001
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

656
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:56,481
Edna's from a family circus.

657
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,121
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

658
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:03,281
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

659
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:04,721
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

660
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,961
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

661
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:09,241
and even the Gentile
what normally fucking hate me,

662
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:11,121
they waved with their hankies.

663
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,401
Justice.

664
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:20,681
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

665
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,721
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

666
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:25,201
he's ascending to the heavens!

667
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:27,641
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

668
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:29,841
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

669
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,121
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

670
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,801
Dead men can see through life

671
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,721
like it was a curtain
that billows

672
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,441
with the flicker of truth
upon it.

673
00:59:37,561 --> 00:59:39,721
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

674
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,041
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

675
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,601
Unlike you,

676
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:47,841
who, on Judgment Day,

677
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:49,721
is probably truly fucked

678
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:51,801
when the other shoe drops.

679
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,321
Hmm?

680
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,601
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

681
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:02,201
You know, Alfie...

682
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:06,561
...so many people,

683
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,721
so many times

684
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:10,561
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

685
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,321
I'm fucking dying anyway.

686
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,241
We're all dying anyway.

687
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,521
No.

688
01:00:17,641 --> 01:00:20,681
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

689
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,681
not a knife.

690
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:24,961
Is it clap? Is it clap?

691
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,761
No, not even that noble.

692
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:29,937
What are you trying to say?

693
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,001
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

694
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:34,241
to you as part of this deal.

695
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:38,241
Are you saying you're
just gonna die in your bed?

696
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:41,161
I'm not gonna die in bed,
Alfie. Who fucking dies in bed?

697
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:43,961
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

698
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:45,521
- Good people, eh?
- Hmm.

699
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,521
Good people.

700
01:00:48,641 --> 01:00:50,401
And yet here we are, Alfie.

701
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,761
After all this time,
just you and me.

702
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,081
And I crossed the line.

703
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:02,921
Michael.

704
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,481
Polly.

705
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,481
Ruby.

706
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:18,761
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

707
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:21,041
you might be better served
expressing it

708
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:23,681
to someone
who gives a fuck

709
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:26,921
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

710
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,881
to pretend to have to.

711
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:33,161
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

712
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,641
And as for death,

713
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:40,081
speaking as someone
who has been dead

714
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:42,321
for a number of years,

715
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:44,361
I can only
heartily recommend it.

716
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:50,241
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

717
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,241
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

718
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,481
Whenever you're ready, boys.

719
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:32,201
That's enough.

720
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,121
Thank you all for coming.

721
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:39,081
Well, at least I can say that,
er...

722
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,401
...I am one of those
rare politicians

723
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:44,201
who actually makes good
on his promises.

724
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,361
Country estate -

725
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:52,681
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

726
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:55,841
I improved my own home
with good intentions

727
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,521
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

728
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,001
Now I'm back where we began...

729
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:08,361
...with horses and caravans...

730
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:12,761
...vagabonds and thieves.

731
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,361
Frances, sit down, please.

732
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,241
I'd like to raise a toast.

733
01:04:30,921 --> 01:04:32,161
A simple toast.

734
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:36,881
To family.

735
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:38,601
- To family.
- To family.

736
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:42,921
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

737
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,561
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

738
01:04:57,921 --> 01:05:00,281
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

739
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:03,041
After I'm gone...

740
01:05:06,441 --> 01:05:07,521
Ada.

741
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,121
...in this family...

742
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:13,841
...it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

743
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,921
Remember that.

744
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:20,841
And if ever a seat
is to become available

745
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:23,281
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

746
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:25,921
Where's Arthur?

747
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:29,201
He went for a walk
down the river.

748
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:31,481
He said he's not good
at farewells

749
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,081
so he's decided to go
and catch a trout instead.

750
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:39,201
He told me to tell you that...

751
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,521
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

752
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:48,321
"...very soon. Love, Arthur."

753
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:57,641
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

754
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:02,641
You watch him, Linda.

755
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:04,641
You love him.

756
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:09,721
Charles...

757
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:12,721
...I want you
to look after your mum.

758
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:16,001
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

759
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:23,401
I want you to be the bes...

760
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:31,721
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

761
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:43,801
Thanks, Curly.

762
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:50,201
I want you to be...

763
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:02,761
Tom, the horse.

764
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:04,481
Shut up, Curly.

765
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:12,721
Is she hitched, Johnny?

766
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:17,521
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

767
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:21,121
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

768
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:22,721
Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

769
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:24,001
You always come to me.

770
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:26,401
Not this time.
Not this one, sister.

771
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:29,601
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

772
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,481
Tommy!

773
01:11:44,321 --> 01:11:48,721
In the bleak midwinter...

774
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,081
<i>Dad, come out, come out!</i>

775
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:56,441
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

776
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,601
Did Polly send you?

777
01:12:14,481 --> 01:12:15,641
Did Polly send you?

778
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:18,241
Or am I dead already?

779
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:19,601
<i>No.</i>

780
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,081
<i>You're not dead.</i>

781
01:12:24,321 --> 01:12:26,401
<i>You're not even sick.</i>

782
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:27,961
But I am, my darling.

783
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:30,961
I am sick.

784
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:33,881
Sick like you was.

785
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:36,081
<i>No. Not true.</i>

786
01:12:36,201 --> 01:12:38,521
<i>I know it.
You've got to live, Daddy.</i>

787
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:43,761
<i>You let the fire go out.</i>

788
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:48,401
Light the fire again
and get warm,

789
01:12:48,521 --> 01:12:51,641
and you will see
that you must live.

790
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:56,641
<i>You're not even sick, Daddy.</i>

791
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:35,201
Fucking Gypsies.

792
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:45,561
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

793
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,321
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir,

794
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,521
but there was no-one there.

795
01:14:48,561 --> 01:14:49,897
Well, go back up there
and set fire

796
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:50,961
to the fucking thing.

797
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:53,001
Yes, sir.

798
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:00,601
Have you filled the car
with petrol?

799
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:11,841
I said, have you filled the car
up with petrol?

800
01:15:15,321 --> 01:15:16,561
How was the wedding in Berlin?

801
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:22,481
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

802
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,201
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

803
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:32,281
Never knew you were
so well connected.

804
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:34,721
Oh, and the doctor
at St Thomas's

805
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:36,801
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

806
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:38,361
second set of X-rays?

807
01:15:39,441 --> 01:15:41,441
A maid of honour
at the same wedding.

808
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:44,481
All so very well
fucking connected.

809
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:48,361
On your knees, Holford.

810
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:56,921
I'm guessing you people
all decided

811
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,281
that the only person

812
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:01,161
who could ever kill
Tommy Shelby...

813
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:04,281
...is Tommy Shelby himself.

814
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:10,041
You made me believe
death was coming.

815
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:12,641
Let my nature do the rest,
eh?

816
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:20,201
You may not have tuberculoma,
Mr Shelby...

817
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:22,641
...but you are sick.

818
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:25,281
I know you.

819
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:28,841
You are sick with guilt.

820
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,601
Sick of death at your own hand.

821
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:36,561
Sick of who you were.

822
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,401
You are no longer
the kind of man

823
01:16:41,521 --> 01:16:43,881
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

824
01:16:49,681 --> 01:16:53,841
Tommy, you have been
on a journey,

825
01:16:53,961 --> 01:16:56,921
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

826
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,201
You cannot go back.

827
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,361
You are a different man.

828
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,641
The gun no longer belongs
in your hand.

829
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:16,961
Oh, but I am back.

830
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:22,561
Back from under the ground.

831
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,441
Close your eyes.

832
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:30,441
Close your eyes.

833
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:54,841
The eleventh hour.

834
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:58,321
Armistice.

835
01:18:01,201 --> 01:18:02,761
Peace at last.

836
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:07,601
Peace at last.
