2000
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,777
Malekith

2001
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,954
Asgard's forces are upon us.

2002
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,983
Send in the Kursed!

2003
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,935
Their deaths will mean our survival.

2004
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,097
This war is far from over.

2005
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,798
The Aether awakens us.

2006
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,426
The Convergence returns.

2007
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,518
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

2008
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,731
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

2009
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,652
Our survival will be your legacy.

2010
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,282
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

2011
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,617
I will reclaim the Aether.

2012
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,952
I will restore our world.

2013
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,746
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

2014
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,963
The worlds are nearly aligned.

2015
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,137
You will be the last of the Kursed.

2016
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,931
Let my life be sacrificed.

2017
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,602
It is no less than our people did,

2018
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,437
or you have done.

2019
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,197
You will become darkness,

2020
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:57,118
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

2021
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,252
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

2022
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:16,137
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

2023
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:19,387
We must strike now.

2024
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,430
No.

2025
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:28,688
Asgard is meaningless.

2026
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,819
The Aether has found its way home.

2027
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:02,748
He is an enemy of Asgard.

2028
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,584
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
