1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:07,090
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,900
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,952
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,411
That's Barry's old house.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,623
- It's been too long. Everything's different.
- Except that mirror.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,418
This mirror might contain
photographs of what happened that night.

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,047
That blood belongs
to one of the speedsters that was here.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,132
It's Barry's. As an adult.

15
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,635
- Mrs. Stein, have you seen this person?
- Yes.

16
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,136
He's not Ronnie anymore.

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,764
He's Martin Stein walking around
in Ronnie's body.

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,143
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

19
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,145
A nuclear explosion.

20
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,622
Barry.

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,375
Barry, what happened out there?

22
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,668
Are you guys okay?

23
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,297
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

24
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,465
I think so.

25
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,302
Oh, God. The nuclear explosion.

26
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,221
There's no telling how much radiation
we were exposed to.

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,351
Wait, wait. This can't be. The Geiger counter in
the suit, it's reading less than one millirad.

28
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,479
- But that's normal.
- There's no radiation.

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,774
Let's go.

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,710
Did it work?

31
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,380
- Did you separate them?
- I don't know.

32
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,763
Ronnie?

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,982
Tell me your name.

34
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,901
Ronnie Raymond.

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,944
Cait.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,405
It's me.

37
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,578
Uh, pardon me.

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,706
Obviously, I need a change of clothes.

39
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,919
Nice to see you in the flesh again,
Professor Stein.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,090
We're coming home.

41
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,927
All of us.

42
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,396
- Ronnie Raymond. Heh.
- Cisco. Heh.

43
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,148
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,693
I missed you so much, man.

45
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,530
- I shouldn't have locked you in there.
- Hey. Don't.

46
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,865
Welcome back, Mr. Raymond.

47
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,910
Dr. Wells.
Caitlin told me what happened to you.

48
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,206
I'm responsible for putting myself
in this chair.

50
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,791
You are responsible for my
still being alive. Thank you.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,628
You said you'd bring him back and you did.
Thank you.

52
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,380
You're welcome.

53
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,923
Uh, excuse me.

54
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,718
Are we all planning to sing
"Kumbaya" next?

55
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,220
Professor Stein, I presume.

56
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,638
Harrison Wells.

57
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,559
Do you have somewhere I can freshen up
and get a change of clothes?

58
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,977
Of course.

59
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,229
Right this way, professor.

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,363
- General, are you getting this?
- Roger that, sergeant.

61
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
Sir, look at this.

62
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,827
Two imprints of impact.

63
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,245
Two imprints.

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,331
Two different people.

65
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,543
It's Firestorm. He's separated.

66
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,337
Your vitals appear to be normal...

67
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,507
except you have a slight fever of 100.6.

68
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,260
- Cait, I'm fine. I promise.
- I know, but we just need to be...

69
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,678
Shh.

70
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,931
Yup. Just when I forgot how awkward it was
to walk in on you two.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,058
You can get used to it again.

72
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,311
I did a full medical workup
on the professor.

73
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,898
It turns out that now that
he and Ronnie are separated...

74
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,026
they no longer possess the ability
to harness nuclear energy.

75
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,447
Professor Stein, you seem to be running
a little hot as well.

76
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,948
Same as Ronnie, 100.6.

77
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,202
Hardly a sweat, Dr. Snow.
And hopefully now the only thing...

78
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,829
- Ronald and I have in common...
- It's Ronnie.

79
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,875
- Mm.
- Hey. You're gonna miss being able to fly?

80
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,378
- Yeah, if I was the one holding the controller.
- Meaning?

81
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,215
Meaning you weren't
the most conscientious body-mate.

82
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,385
So you do not consider keeping you alive
to be conscientious?

83
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,055
Alive? We were living under a bridge
eating garbage.

84
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,558
I didn't determine it'd be my mind
that would dominate our existence...

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,812
but thank God it was.

86
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,483
I could feel your fear and panic, emotions
that would have gotten us killed in that state.

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,320
You kept me buried down.
You kept me from her.

88
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,740
Which is likely why she's still alive.

89
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,910
I believe you and I have spent
quite enough time together.

90
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,912
- Yeah.
- I would like to go see my wife.

91
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,581
- Mr. Allen will take you.
- Thank you.

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,503
I need some pizza.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,255
You got it.

94
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,554
I can't believe it. Uh, wait.

95
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,389
Uh...

96
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,599
What should I say?

97
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,103
I don't think
you're gonna have to say anything.

98
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,942
Clarissa.

99
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,237
I'm so sorry I put you through this.

100
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,416
Thank you.

101
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,335
Mr...

102
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,880
- Barry.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,217
Barry, I know I can be difficult...

104
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,261
but thank you for bringing me home.

105
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,139
I'll see you soon, professor.

106
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,233
- Seeing what could only be described...
- Hey.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,777
- I left you three messages.
- I know. I'm sorry.

108
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,947
About the lack of communication
or that hole out in the badlands?

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,949
We're all fine. Thanks.

110
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
I wasn't calling about the explosion.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,498
- I have to show you something.
- What?

112
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,349
It's smaller than I remember.

113
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,769
Yeah, it's because you're bigger.

114
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:20,732
- Have you been in here? I mean, recently?
- No.

115
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,361
I haven't been in this
house since that night.

116
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,989
Bar.

117
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,201
This mirror. Do you remember it?

118
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,454
Yeah. It belonged to my grandma.

119
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,456
How is it still here?

120
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,375
Just be glad it is.

121
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,085
Look...

122
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,630
I don't fully know
how Cisco did it, but...

123
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,131
Did what?

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,509
Joe, what are we doing here?

125
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,401
Mom.

126
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:11,157
You can definitely see two very fast people
fighting around your mother.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,326
Two speedsters.

128
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,829
You see that?

129
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,206
The blood?

130
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,167
Cisco and I had the DNA tested.

131
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,086
It's yours.

132
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,757
No, it's not. That's impossible.
I wasn't even downstairs yet.

133
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,429
No, Barry, not that you. This you.

134
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,097
Cisco had the samples analyzed...

135
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,100
and the proteins in the blood
were that of an adult...

136
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,019
not a child.

137
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,105
But that means...

138
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,524
The speedster trying to stop
the man in yellow...

139
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,693
Is the Flash.

140
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,738
That's me.

141
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,037
Time travel.

142
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,250
If the last five months have proven
anything, it's that anything can exist.

143
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,294
But to actually travel through time?

144
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,963
Well, the greatest
minds in human history...

145
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,966
put their collective genius towards
solving that puzzle.

146
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,135
So is it possible?

147
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,137
Yes, it's possible.

148
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,473
But problematic. I mean...

149
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,769
assuming you could create the conditions
necessary to take that journey...

150
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,563
that journey would be fraught
with potential pitfalls.

151
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,274
Novikov principle of self-consistency
for example...

152
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,650
Wait, the what now?

153
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,195
If you travel back in time
to change something...

154
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,532
then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

155
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,743
- Like Terminator.
- Ah.

156
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,621
Or is time plastic? Is it mutable...

157
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,458
whereby any changes to the continuum
could create an alternate timeline?

158
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,877
- Back to the Future.
- Oh.

159
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,632
- I saw that one too.
- "Doc Brown." Tremendous picture.

160
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,593
Right. So, what's the answer?

161
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,472
I might be a clever guy, but if you're
asking me to give you a theory...

162
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,809
on how to travel through time,
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

163
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,520
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

164
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,237
Danish?

165
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,741
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator?

166
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,620
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

167
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,832
So, what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,378
The only new information is Wells admitted
he was warned of a potential disaster.

169
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,879
Yeah.

170
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
Why do you think he did that?

171
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,884
Because he's a good person?

172
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,219
- Is he?
- Yes.

173
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,721
He saved my friend's life.

174
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,475
He was struck by lightning
and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive.

175
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,729
So your friend wouldn't need saving if
Wells hadn't zapped him in the first place.

176
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,567
- It was an accident.
- What if it wasn't?

177
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,863
So you think Harrison Wells wanted
the particle accelerator to explode?

178
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,409
- Why would he do that?
- Don't know what goes on in that building.

179
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,828
But I think you know some people who do.

180
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,998
I'm gonna investigate my friends
because you got me a Danish?

181
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
I think that you'll do it...

182
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,254
because you really wanna know
what goes on inside that building.

183
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,930
Barry.

184
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,809
Mrs. Stein, I'm sorry to bother you here
but is Professor Stein here right now?

185
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,188
Well, after a year apart,
I'm not letting him out of my sight.

186
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,943
S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a
few tests on Martin, didn't they?

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,361
And they said he was fine?

188
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,906
Yeah. Why? Something wrong?

189
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,784
- He just seems a little different, is all.
- Different how?

190
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,039
He's been asking for pizza.
Martin despises pizza.

191
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,042
Is that the delivery man? Oh, Mr. Allen.

192
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,045
I suppose it's too much to hope
you moonlight as a pizza boy.

193
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,963
I am famished.

194
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,633
Okay.

195
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,221
- Aah!
- Oh.

196
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,680
Bravo.

197
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,140
Please, come in...

198
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,809
Mr. Allen.

199
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,395
Uh, oh. Ahem.

200
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
What can I do for you?

201
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,025
I needed to talk to you about a paper
that you wrote 25 years ago...

202
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,860
for the Oxford University Press?

203
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,697
I have written many papers for that
publication. Could you be more specific?

204
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,574
Time travel.

205
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,163
These are just a few of the random thoughts
I've had on the subject.

206
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,998
A few?

207
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,210
See, I believe that space-time...

208
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:37,215
is a free-flowing highway
that intersects the physical world.

209
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,135
We live in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

210
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,263
Theoretically, to travel through time...

211
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,516
one merely needs to find a way
onto the highway.

212
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:51,396
Okay. So you're saying that this is actually
possible, to travel into the future?

213
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,189
Undoubtedly.

214
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,691
What about the past?

215
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,942
Yes.

216
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,697
My own personal choice
would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.

217
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,409
I think Nikola Tesla and I,
we'd have some wonderful arguments.

218
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,122
What about you? Would you be interested
in taking a trip into history?

219
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,168
I think that I already have.

220
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,965
Professor, um...

221
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,384
15 years ago, my mom was murdered...

222
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,556
and we recently discovered
some evidence that...

223
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,560
I was there that night,
and not just as a kid...

224
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,395
but as an adult.

225
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:38,776
That must be a side effect
of your incredible speed.

226
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:44,407
In some future date,
you actually move so fast...

227
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,493
that the resulting
kinetic energy buildup...

228
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:52,206
smashes a hole
in the space-time continuum.

229
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,460
Ha! Ha, ha.

230
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,505
You seem disappointed by the prospect.

231
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,718
I mean, if I do...

232
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,014
somehow make it back there
to that night, then...

233
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,683
it means that I didn't save her.

234
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,395
My destiny is to fail.

235
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,029
The boomerang goes flying through
the Cortex, smashing everything...

236
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,740
and Cisco's all,
"My bad. This one's on me."

237
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,160
Ha, ha. Sounds like you had
some crazy times.

238
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,037
Yeah, we have.

239
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,415
- Are you ready for life to get back to normal?
- What do you mean?

240
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,251
I was thinking we could leave town...

241
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,628
start fresh somewhere.

242
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,633
Our lives are here, my job is here.

243
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,676
Yeah, hunting metahumans.

244
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,679
There's more to it than that.

245
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,181
And it's dangerous.

246
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,683
It can be.

247
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:58,189
Look, I stayed at S.T.A.R. Labs
because I believed in Dr. Wells...

248
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,193
but ever since Barry became the Flash...

249
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,239
and we've been working
to keep the city safe...

250
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,991
I found a new way to help people.

251
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,161
Look, Cait, I'm not mad at anyone.

252
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,456
Okay, I know the accelerator explosion
was an accident...

253
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:20,670
but that building took a year of our
lives, I don't want it to take any more.

254
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,339
Do you guys need anything else?

255
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,716
- We're about to close up.
- I'm good.

256
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,093
Babe?

257
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,973
Ronnie, get down.

258
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,102
Get out of here.

259
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,896
- No, not without you.
- I'm right behind you. Go.

260
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,610
- Professor.
- Martin.

261
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,779
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

262
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,701
I feel terrified. My heart is racing.

263
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,499
Ugh!

264
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,001
Hands in the air.

265
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,381
I think... I think Ronald is in trouble.

266
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,717
How could you know that?

267
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,470
Jitters. He needs help. Go.

268
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,476
Ronald Raymond.

269
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,728
The burning man himself.

270
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,438
Half of him, anyway.

271
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,983
- Who are you?
- General Wade Eiling, United States Army.

272
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,904
- What do you want?
- Firestorm.

273
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,716
It stings, doesn't it?

274
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,552
Ha, ha.
Had that one developed especially for you.

275
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,096
Micro fragments
attracted to kinetic energy.

276
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,393
Firestorm was tonight's main objective,
but getting you, that's just gravy.

277
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,399
- Unh!
- Get in.

278
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,158
Gentlemen, we are at war.

279
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,459
Hurry. Barry's wounds are starting to heal
with fragments under his skin.

280
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,045
It's just like that time
I stepped on a sea urchin.

281
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,255
Only much worse.

282
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,841
- Ugh! Just don't pee on me.
- You know that's a myth, right?

283
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,807
I'm so stupid.

284
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,477
Jason Rusch, who is helping Professor Stein
with his Firestorm research...

285
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,147
he said that the Army took all of
Stein's material when he disappeared.

286
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,150
- I should have known it was General Eiling.
- Not your fault.

287
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,654
He thinks you hold the keys
to the ultimate human weapon, both of you.

288
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,825
Okay. Let's finish this. I gotta get to
Stein's house, Eiling's gonna be after him too.

289
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,952
- Stein's fine.
- How do you know?

290
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,287
He's right there.

291
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,667
I don't think Mr. Raymond and I
are as distinctive as we had hoped.

292
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,753
I'm still inside Ronald.

293
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,423
There has to be a
better way to phrase that.

294
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,802
Beta, alpha, theta, delta.
All your brain waves are perfectly in sync.

295
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,014
The chances of that happening
are next to impossible.

296
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,433
Impossible is just another Tuesday,
remember?

297
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,185
Yeah, but this is like
some Twilight Zone level stuff...

298
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,896
and I know we have a guy
locked up in our basement...

299
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,982
who can turn himself into poison gas.

300
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,443
- Wait, really?
- Dude, that was like week three.

301
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,864
Look, if this Eiling is as dangerous
as you say, then I need to warn Clarissa.

302
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,201
I promise, I can get Clarissa out of the
city in time, but we need you to stay here.

303
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,621
Professor, I need you to trust us.

304
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,998
Very well.

305
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,881
Hey. Are you okay?

306
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,966
Yeah.

307
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,385
Yeah, it's just not the
S.T.A.R. Labs I knew.

308
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,890
Ronnie, this isn't the world that you knew.

309
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,392
Tell me about it.

310
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,938
All right, here we are. Uh...

311
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,194
All right. You guys can stay down in
Iris' old room, it's kind of small, but...

312
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,904
Hey.

313
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,615
- We have guests?
- Yeah, we do. I hope that's okay.

314
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,409
- Mi casa.
- This is Ronnie.

315
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,911
Nice to meet you.

316
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,246
Ronnie? The...?

317
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,541
- Dead fiancé.
- Right.

318
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,086
- Beer?
- Thanks.

319
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,088
Dad? Barry?

320
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,590
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

321
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,342
What are you doing here?

322
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,720
Uh, it's Tuesday.
I was gonna make us dinner, remember?

323
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,222
- Yup.
- Yeah.

324
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,308
- Here, I'll help you. Got it.
- I knew you'd forget.

325
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:48,145
There's plenty for everyone.
Caitlin, what brings you by?

326
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,275
There is a gas leak in my apartment,
so Barry said that we could stay here.

327
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,237
Oh, that's sweet of him.
And, uh, who's this?

328
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,407
This is, uh...

329
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,284
- Her cousin.
- Sam.

330
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,454
Visiting from Coast City.

331
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,958
You look really familiar, Sam.

332
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,253
Yeah, I have one of those faces.

333
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,963
So, what's for dinner?

334
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,179
- Harrison.
- Wade.

335
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,891
I had a feeling you'd be wheeling by.

336
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,601
Tell me.

337
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,022
Are they still pulling needles
out of Barry Allen's hide?

338
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,817
Hmm.

339
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,446
I guess your sweet little Flash didn't want
Sergeant Sans Souci to die...

340
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,656
looking into a mask.

341
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,324
Ugh!

342
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,994
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

343
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,295
I don't know how Firestorm works.

344
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,131
Well, you may not know the how...

345
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,841
but you know the who.

346
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,176
Both of them.

347
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,847
Thanks to you, it's the dawn of a new age,
Harrison.

348
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,058
The Cold War, the War On Terror...

349
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,813
they'll seem like cavemen fighting with
sticks once those two freaks bind together.

350
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,069
Well, you know where to find me
when you come to the right decision.

351
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,363
And I know you will.

352
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,200
Because, after all,
you're the smartest guy I know.

353
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,548
Barr.

354
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,302
Should I have not shown you?

355
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,224
No, I had to know.

356
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,975
We have been through so much.

357
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,437
You have, all your life.

358
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,233
And you've been...

359
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,068
So strong.

360
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,403
But I...

361
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,447
am still your guardian.

362
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:08,452
And it's my job to guard you
not just physically...

363
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,162
but from heartache.

364
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,877
I can't help but feel like
I just handed you a brand-new burden.

365
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,672
Yeah.

366
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,216
But it's our burden. Right?

367
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,426
Yeah.

368
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,886
Yeah.

369
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,307
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

370
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,936
How did you know that the blood
in the house belonged to me?

371
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,939
You would have had
to have tested it specifically.

372
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:44,572
Cisco tested it against everyone
who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.

373
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,285
You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?

374
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,289
Joe...

375
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:01,046
Dr. Wells had nothing to do
with my mom's murder.

376
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,299
You believe that now?

377
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,218
Yeah.

378
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,138
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

379
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,481
Cheers.

380
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,276
Cheers.

381
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,156
- Delicious.
- Mm.

382
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,326
This is, uh, quite an impressive facility.

383
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
Well, it was.

384
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,997
Now it's just a shell, I'm afraid.

385
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,460
It must have been devastating seeing...

386
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,338
your life's work fall to pieces
before your eyes.

387
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,883
It was, and yet...

388
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,678
it was the exact same moment
your life's work came to fruition.

389
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,181
Ah, my life's work?

390
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:59,188
If living the last 14 months
as a conjoined metahuman...

391
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,942
has taught me anything,
it's that my life's work...

392
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,820
should have been being the best husband
I could to my wife.

393
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,285
Are you all right, Martin?

394
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,620
Heh.

395
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,372
I apologize.

396
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,706
It's just...

397
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,459
I feel a little light-headed.

398
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,715
- Are you okay?
- Um...

399
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,050
Yeah.

400
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:33,055
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just got a little dizzy for a second.

401
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,189
You want the secret to Firestorm.

402
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,358
He has it.

403
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,069
You see, Harrison?
We do work well together.

404
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,252
Oh, hey. You said you knew some of the
leftover scientists at the S.T.A.R. Lab.

405
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,922
- What about a Caitlin Snow, MD? Know her?
- Yeah, I know her. Why?

406
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,009
There was an incident in a
local coffee shop. She was there.

407
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,929
That's Jitters, I used to work there.

408
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,848
Is there anything you can't do?

409
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,601
Witnesses saw soldiers
shooting the place up.

410
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,063
So I contacted the Army's
media relations division and asked:

411
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,109
"Are soldiers permitted to operate like
that on U.S. soil?" Know what they told me?

412
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,610
Hooah.

413
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,780
Weird. Caitlin didn't mention anything
the last time I saw her.

414
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,783
Really? When and where was that?

415
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,787
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure
there's an explanation for all of this.

416
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,811
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

417
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,894
He didn't hurt you?

418
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,313
Barry, I told you, only my pride is hurt.

419
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,774
I'm not in the position
to take on armed soldiers.

420
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,236
- Where do you think Eiling took Stein?
- Some off-the-books military research facility.

421
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,656
- We have to get him back.
- Easy. Eiling has already demonstrated...

422
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,659
he has the weaponry
to disable the Flash or worse.

423
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,162
Well, we can't let him
turn Stein into a weapon.

424
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,497
How do we find him?

425
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,589
What?

426
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,427
No abnormal brain
activity. All vitals steady.

427
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,138
You think Ronnie can feel
where they're keeping Stein?

428
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,265
Ronnie got dizzy
when soldiers grabbed Stein...

429
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,851
and Stein developed
Ronnie's obsession with pizza.

430
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,520
I don't feel anything right now.

431
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,438
Just keep trying.

432
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,607
Whatever this is, it doesn't have a switch.

433
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,945
It's possible it's just some kind of
residual connection.

434
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,739
You know, a temporary link
to your time together.

435
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,534
Wait. I feel something.

436
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,414
I'm cold.

437
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,542
It's freezing in here.

438
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,462
My apologies.
It should warm up pretty quick.

439
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,011
I know what you want.

440
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:23,392
But my research was never intended
to be used as a weapon.

441
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,728
I joined the military
when I was 20 years old, professor.

442
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,732
My father had me convinced
that our greatest threat was the Soviets...

443
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,860
our greatest fear nuclear war.

444
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,612
But then came terrorism.

445
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,990
And Ebola.

446
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,576
And now it's the age of Firestorm.

447
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,579
Soldiers enhanced by your project,
professor.

448
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:48,750
Soldiers who can generate energy blasts
with their bare hands. Soldiers who can fly.

449
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,420
I would gladly die...

450
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,257
before I see my life's work
perverted in this way.

451
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,675
Good.

452
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,552
Because you will die, professor.

453
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,723
How soon I let that happen though,
is entirely up to you.

454
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,767
What's going on?

455
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,356
The last time I did this was to a gorilla.

456
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,949
- You're okay, man. We got you.
- What's happening to him?

457
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,202
Nothing's happening to him.

458
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,288
It's happening to Stein,
and Ronnie is feeling his pain.

459
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,081
I was wrong.

460
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,293
Their connection is not temporary,
it's only getting stronger.

461
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,879
Just try and hold on.

462
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,049
Water. Water.

463
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,645
My, my, my.

464
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,399
You show remarkable grit for a teacher.

465
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,985
I am impressed.

466
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,821
Why don't we let you catch your breath?

467
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,658
Think about how much more of this
you want to endure.

468
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,493
Hmm?

469
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,461
- Ronnie, no.
- Wait, Cait, wait.

470
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,005
- He's cutting himself.
- I know. Let him.

471
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,850
Huh.

472
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,941
Ronald.

473
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,869
Anything?

474
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,164
Nothing. Nothing, just...

475
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,334
Just cold, like a metal surface.

476
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,337
Pressure on and on and off.

477
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,424
Tap, tap.

478
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,552
Tap. Tap. Tap.

479
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,679
Tap, tap, tap.

480
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,681
- Morse code.
- I got this.

481
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,560
Same thing again. Tap, tap. Tap.

482
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,191
Tap, tap, tap.

483
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,068
- Twenty-seven.
- What does it mean?

484
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,531
Army bases. They sometimes go
by numbers like Area 51.

485
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:29,077
Facility 27 about 300 miles away.
It was shut down in 1961.

486
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,247
- That's where they're keeping Stein.
- And keeping the aliens too.

487
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,333
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you can't.

488
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,376
I'm connected to Stein. I have to go.

489
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:40,213
But did you ever stop to think why your
connection to him is growing stronger?

490
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,215
Maybe you're being drawn back together.

491
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,052
Maybe your proximity
will cause you to re-merge into one.

492
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,387
And what happens to me if he gets killed?

493
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,641
Cait, Barry was right.

494
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,435
The world's different now.

495
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,771
Look, I thought we could get away...

496
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,105
start a new life.

497
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,068
A normal life together.
But there is no normal life for us.

498
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,446
You will always risk your life
to try and help people.

499
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:08,658
And I will always be the guy
that runs into that pipeline for you.

500
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,289
The quantum splicer.
It was used to separate you once.

501
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,875
Maybe it could be of use to keep you, you.

502
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,835
Thanks.

503
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,546
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait.

504
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,802
Come back.

505
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,804
All three of you.

506
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,808
Let's go.

507
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,488
Oh.

508
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,824
This place definitely
doesn't look too shady.

509
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,659
Stein's inside.

510
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,829
I can feel our connection growing stronger
like he's pulling me.

511
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,705
As I feared, the Firestorm matrix...

512
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,417
is building toward
a proximity re-emergence.

513
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,461
Like all matter, it yearns to be whole.

514
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,175
If you two merge...

515
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,262
we might not be able
to separate you again.

516
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,599
We isolated the Firestorm matrix
in the subject's cellular structure.

517
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,309
Excellent.

518
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,647
Professor Stein, I'm afraid
you have made a terrible assumption:

519
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,816
That I need you alive.

520
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,072
Eiling has a gun to Stein's head.
He's about to pull the trigger.

521
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,996
He's here.

522
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,748
Aah! Oh.

523
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,209
Whoa.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

524
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,961
- Likewise.
- Let's get out of here.

525
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,139
Aah!

526
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,560
Run!

527
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,061
Okay, come on. Come on.

528
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,944
Barry, I'm picking up some serious
PH numbers on your suit.

529
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,571
They hit me with some chemical.

530
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,991
It's a weaponized phosphorus.
Water or foam won't extinguish it.

531
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,245
But you can't burn in a vacuum.
So you need to create one.

532
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,499
Run, Barry. Run.

533
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,515
- We need to merge again.
- No.

534
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,892
- Cait, we're dead if we don't.
- Listen to me.

535
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,104
The last time you two combined,
you both fought it. This time, don't.

536
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,901
Accept the change. Accept the balance.
Accept each other.

537
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,862
Once more unto the breach, dear friend.

538
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,159
Cait...

539
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,579
whatever happens, just remember...

540
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,665
I'll always love you.

541
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,889
- Can you hear me, Ronald?
- Professor?

542
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,725
It appears we've merged properly
on this attempt.

543
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,312
Wells was right about balance
and accepting it. Behind you.

544
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,986
Ronald, there's more of them.

545
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,004
Eiling, this ends now.

546
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,923
Yes, it does. For both of you.

547
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,013
An ion grenade...

548
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,975
bombarded your cellular structure with
enough ions to destabilize your matrix.

549
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:07,606
Mr. Raymond, Professor Stein,
you were both fine Americans.

550
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,692
Your country thanks you for your sacrifice.

551
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,283
That was a lot of running.

552
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,878
Ronnie.

553
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,215
- Home?
- Yeah.

554
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,192
I think it looks worse than it is.

555
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,240
Ronnie or Stein?

556
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,993
- It's me, Caitlin.
- Ahem. Excuse me.

557
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,913
- It's both of us. Somehow.
- She's quite lovely.

558
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,666
Acceptance is a powerful thing.

559
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,459
Powerful enough to reverse it?

560
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,671
- I'm game if you are, Mr. Raymond.
- We could try.

561
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,282
Oh. I think we're getting
the hang of this quite nicely.

562
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
It's okay.

563
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,633
I understand. You have to go.

564
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,804
- How'd you know?
- I'm connected to you too.

565
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,306
Heh.

566
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,362
- Where will you go?
- Pittsburgh, maybe.

567
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:23,575
Professor Stein has a colleague he thinks
can help us learn more about our abilities.

568
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,243
We can help you here too.

569
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:29,372
Eiling's already breached S.T.A.R. Labs.
We need to stay one step ahead of him.

570
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,291
For all of us.

571
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,419
- I'm coming back.
- We'll have pizza.

572
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,473
- Godspeed, Mr. Allen.
- You too.

573
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,350
As per our earlier conversation...

574
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,353
I believe in second chances.

575
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,607
You'll get yours. Give it time.

576
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,779
Ready, Ronald?

577
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,530
Please stop calling me that.

578
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,699
I'll see you soon.

579
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,806
We love you.

580
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:44,030
I had Ronnie, then I lost him. Then I found
him again, but he wasn't actually Ronnie.

581
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:48,034
Then I got him back,
but just for a day until I lost him again.

582
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:53,873
You guys are, like, 10 seasons of Ross and
Rachel but just, like, smushed into one year.

583
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,212
I am not heartbroken this time.

584
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,966
I love Ronnie. I always will.

585
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:07,428
But there's not this
devastating hole inside me.

586
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,223
I have a life and it's a good one.

587
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,184
Hey, guys.

588
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,936
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

589
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,521
Where's your cousin?

590
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,149
- Uh, he went home.
- Oh.

591
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,526
Where was that again?

592
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,778
Uh, Midway.

593
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,116
Oh, I thought you said Coast City.

594
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:32,662
Uh, Midway via Coast City.
He moved around a lot.

595
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,956
Heh. That's always really hard.

596
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,959
- Yeah.
- All right, well, enjoy.

597
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,086
- Bye.
- See you.

598
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,972
Am I supposed to know what that means?

599
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,310
It means that I'm gonna help you figure out
what's going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.

600
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,729
I think our burning man used to work there.

601
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,485
- Hey.
- So why did you bring me here?

602
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,740
I don't know how and I don't know when...

603
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,659
but one day soon,
I'm gonna be in this house again...

604
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,663
15 years ago and I'm gonna fail...

605
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,666
- unless this time I don't.
- What are you saying?

606
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,588
Knowing that I'm supposed to lose
gives me the advantage.

607
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:28,635
Those images are a
lesson in what not to do.

608
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,596
When I face off against
the man in yellow...

609
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,807
I won't make the same mistake twice.

610
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,810
You're gonna change the past?

611
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,312
Joe...

612
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,648
I'm gonna save my mom.

613
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,711
What...? What the hell was that?

614
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,298
- It's good to see you again, general.
- Who are you?

615
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,051
Who am I?

616
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,725
Harrison.

617
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,978
You're one of them.

618
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,729
Metahuman.

619
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
Yes, I am.

620
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,110
And I protect my own.

621
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,906
Who is that?

622
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,992
Now, that...

623
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,244
ils an old friend of ours.

624
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,579
General.

625
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,168
That voice. It's in my head.

626
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,922
- Dear God.
- Not God.

627
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,882
Grodd.

628
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:57,906
