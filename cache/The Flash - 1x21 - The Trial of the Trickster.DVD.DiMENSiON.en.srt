7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,161
Let me in! You have to let me in.
I have evidence for the defense!

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,890
This city's gone absolutely nuts.

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,399
I tried flowers.
Maybe I should get something else.

10
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,730
Everywhere you go,
you hear about the Trickster.

11
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,897
Sabrina bitches how I work all the time.
So we go out, right?

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,635
Bump into an ex-girlfriend,
now she thinks I'm cheating.

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,302
Today begins the trial
of James Montgomery Jessie.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,641
A multiple personality wanted
for murder...

15
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,546
...Jessie adopted the persona
of the costumed psychopath...

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,177
...known as the Trickster. His days
of violent mayhem in Central City...

17
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,950
...were ended
by fem private eye Megan Lockhart.

18
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,570
Accept no substitutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,182
I am the genuine article.

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,521
I'm gonna make this city very sorry
it ever crossed me.

21
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,122
Well, Barry Allen.

22
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,995
I'm gonna make you pay too, Allen.

23
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,824
You and your little cupcake girlfriend,
Megan Lockhart.

24
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,990
And the Flash, the big red freak...

25
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,467
...he'll pay the going rate
10 times over...

26
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,835
...because nobody tricks the Trickster.

27
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,737
Nobody!

28
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,374
The last time we pulled this kind of duty
was at that concert at Crystal Beach.

29
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,450
No kidding. I hear they're scalping tickets
for seats outside.

30
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,451
They're welcome to mine.
There's lots of places I'd rather be.

31
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,146
Don't worry, there's no way
the Trickster's gonna walk.

32
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,454
I'm not so sure. He's got this hotshot
lawyer defending him, Denise Cowan.

33
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,961
Cowan? Didn't she get that Wall Street guy
acquitted of murder?

34
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:23,228
- And they had videotapes of him doing it.
- Well, I'm glad I got front-row seats.

35
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,301
Well, at least Megan
will be back in town.

36
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,633
I just want to testify
and get out of here.

37
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,403
- I don't think it's gonna be that easy, man.
- Barry Allen.

38
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,776
You were nearly drowned by the Trickster
because of your involvement...

39
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,110
...with private eye Megan Lockhart.
Any comment?

40
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,377
- No.
- Are you gonna stand in the way...

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,113
...of journalist inquiry,
of the people's right to know?

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,757
- It's un-American.
- Kline, you're making me nauseous.

43
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,223
Hey, Bar, if you don't tell
your side of things...

44
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,988
...Kline will put words in your mouth.
It's self-defense.

45
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,825
Come on, Bar.

46
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,568
Well, it all came to a head
in the prop warehouse.

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,763
- Where Jessie knocked me out...
- Forget about him. There she is!

48
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,168
Megan Lockhart.

49
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,278
The detective responsible for bringing the
Trickster to justice. She was kidnapped...

50
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,075
...and forced to wear the costume
of the Trickster's fantasy sidekick, Prank.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,219
How does it feel to be the woman
who stole the Trickster's heart?

52
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,580
I didn't steal anything.

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,315
It just kept coming gift-wrapped COD.
And I had help taking Jessie down...

54
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,688
There must have been something
to make the Trickster so hot to trot.

55
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,024
- How far did you go to get your man?
- You have got to be kidding me.

56
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,688
I never kid, babe.

57
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,630
Look, I'll try to squeeze you all in, okay?

58
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,066
- Think you can squeeze me in?
- Get in line, fella.

59
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,500
Megan.

60
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,870
Barry. Hi!

61
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,207
- You look great. I've never seen you...
- Oh, my secretary again.

62
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,713
- You have a secretary now?
- It has been insane...

63
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,250
...since we brought the Trickster in.
I have been turning down clients.

64
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,389
Which is why I haven't written lately,
and I'm really sorry.

65
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,317
Can this reunion take five,
because we have a deadline.

66
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,222
- Thank you.
- Later, boys.

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,228
We'll have time for pictures
and statements after the hearing.

68
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,390
- Look, just get... Megan...
- I'll see you inside.

69
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,535
- On how this case is going to shape up?

70
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,836
Not quite the reunion I'd imagined.

71
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,773
You have to...
You have to let me in.

72
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,708
You just have to.
I'm carrying the Trickster's child.

73
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,476
You're just gonna have to carry him
right back where you came from, lady.

74
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,250
You call this a trial?

75
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,415
This is nothing more than a kangaroo
court without the hoppy, furry guy.

76
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,924
- Order, order!
- Lf I were behind the bench, maybe...

77
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,255
Jessie, please!

78
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,456
Ms. Cowan, if you cannot control
your client...

79
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,101
...l'm gonna have him restrained.
- Restrained?

80
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,328
What do you call these,
costume jewelry?

81
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,937
Jessie, shut up!

82
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,370
It's bad enough you insist on wearing
this ridiculous outfit in court.

83
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,204
Don't blow this for both of us.

84
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,312
What, and disappoint my loyal fans?

85
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,473
You don't have loyal fans.
The only person on your side is me!

86
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,579
And that's starting to look like
a real bad career mood.

87
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,449
Your Honor, defense requests
a change of venue.

88
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,818
- Are you nuts?
- I see no way that my client...

89
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,428
...can get a fair trial in Central City.
- Leave Central City?

90
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,123
You are crazy. I love this town.

91
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,201
- And it loves me. Look what I've done for it.
- Your Honor.

92
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,396
That is it.
You are in contempt of this court.

93
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,475
No! I'll tell you who's in contempt.
This courtroom is in contempt.

94
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,203
The entire judicial system
is in contempt.

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,974
North America, the land mass,
is in contempt.

96
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,346
Jessie, get a grip! You're losing it!

97
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,044
I'm perfectly sane.

98
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,385
I am the Trickster.

99
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,449
And you!

100
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,094
Pretending to be Prank
when you were never my loyal sidekick.

101
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,664
Bailiff!

102
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,563
This is all your fault!

103
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,572
You're getting to be a drag, Jessie.

104
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,737
And I am bored stiff.

105
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,188
Megan attacked The Trickster.
He's down.

106
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,689
If I don't get complete silence,
I'm going to empty this courtroom.

107
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,386
I'm gonna wave bail
pending psychiatric evaluation.

108
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,393
This court is recessed
until 9 a.m. Monday morning.

109
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,771
- Get him out of here!
- A few questions for the people out there...

110
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,601
- I'm sorry, not now. I'm sorry.
- He's too good for you, tramp!

111
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,239
- No, not now, really.
- Megan!

112
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,847
With Jessie in custody and Megan in town,
no one's talking about the Flash anymore.

113
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,486
I'm not sure I like that.

114
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,420
- Joe Kline would kill for an interview.
- I don't want attention that much.

115
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,683
- Would you like another?
- No. Thanks.

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,625
- It's funny, don't you think?
- What?

117
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,926
A year ago, you came to me
wanting to get rid of these powers.

118
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:54,095
Who'd have thought we'd be sitting here
now, talking about the Flash's publicity?

119
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,208
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
I'm still a bottomless pit.

120
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,141
In the last year, I've gone near bust
on food alone.

121
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,409
Thanks. I'm lying to everyone I know
about my nights.

122
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,249
But, Barry, look at the good you've done.
You stopped the Trickster's rampage.

123
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,018
Well, I think I'm a little fed up
with my own multiple personality.

124
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,857
Maybe I'll go public.
Make us both famous.

125
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,999
I and my faithful
and beautiful companion...

126
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,761
...Christina McGee, am in reality...
Megan.

127
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,029
Barry, Tina.

128
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,867
Small town, huh?

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,703
I saw you on the news.
I wish I had my autograph book on me.

130
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,676
- You really charmed the press.
- I'm sorry about that, Barry.

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,806
- But they just won't leave me alone.
- Well, when are we getting together?

132
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,545
You know, I really wish I could say,
but I am buried.

133
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,518
L... I'm meeting my agent for a drink.

134
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,385
Your agent? This is a new you.

135
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,823
I'm getting book and movie offers
out of nowhere.

136
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,691
As soon as things lighten up,
I promise we'll get together.

137
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,899
- Yeah. I'll check my schedule.
- Great.

138
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,802
I've gotta go. I'm busy too, you know.

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,902
What's that about, McGee?

140
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:07,071
Megan, for a detective, sometimes
you miss some pretty big clues.

141
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,007
I've already told you, counselor.

142
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,620
No. No. No!

143
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,519
Damn it, Jessie. You are going
to have to listen to me...

144
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,923
...and follow my lead, or you can kiss
any hope of acquittal goodbye.

145
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,655
So who the hell needs you anyway?

146
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,197
I've got law degrees too, you know.

147
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,834
- A whole trunk full of them.
- Mail call.

148
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,735
You're some lucky guy, Tricksy.
You've got a secret admirer.

149
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,639
Yep. And one who's dead set on using up
all the cheap perfume in town.

150
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,337
Is this the police department's
idea of a joke?

151
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,109
No. These were delivered
by a bona fide representative...

152
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,013
...of the U.S. Post Office.

153
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,712
Oh, boy. This is disgusting.

154
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,519
- She's crazy about me.
- Yeah, well, you're half right anyway.

155
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,954
Counselor, visiting hours are over.

156
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:05,196
- Jessie, remember what I said.
- Yeah, yeah.

157
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,368
Maybe I should be
defending myself.

158
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,133
Don't be a fool.

159
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,537
I can't help it.

160
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,820
"I'll get you out. Prank."

161
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,360
Prank?

162
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,701
- You brought Sabrina here on a date?
- Well, at least I'll be seen with her.

163
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,105
Maybe we'll run into one
of his other old flames.

164
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,006
Look, I keep telling you, Sabrina.

165
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,977
Baby, Jinx and I are old news.

166
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,014
- Jinx?
- When I walked into that club...

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,779
...she was all over him like a cheap suit.
- You had a girlfriend named Jinx?

168
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,649
Oh, what's in a name?

169
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,583
Mr. Jessie.

170
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,992
You understand that another outburst
like Friday's will not be tolerated.

171
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,762
Your Honor, before we begin, my client
would like to address the court.

172
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,000
- Lf the people have no objection.
- The people have no objection.

173
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,043
Your Honor...

174
00:11:55,448 --> 00:12:00,044
...you can't imagine how sorry I am
for what I've done.

175
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,414
But I am under the influence...

176
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,354
...of demons inside me
battling for my very soul.

177
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:11,420
I swear to you, if I could have
stopped the killing, I would have.

178
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,394
But I'm so weak.

179
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,794
The others inside me...

180
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,529
...are so strong.

181
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,064
This is a load of...

182
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,740
But I'm sorry.

183
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,139
I'm really sorry.

184
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,405
Your Honor, my client can't...

185
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,250
What the hell is that?

186
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,122
I will not have my courtroom
turned into a circus.

187
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,890
Bailiff, get rid of that teddy bear!

188
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,943
Laughing gas.

189
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,888
You can't go.

190
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,992
- You're gonna blow this case.
- Whose side are you on anyway?

191
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,228
Sacrificing yourself for a lawyer?

192
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,736
- Time to rethink your priorities, bub.
- No time. Let's go.

193
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,200
- He's gone.
- No, not again.

194
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,739
What happened in there?

195
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,778
I'm sorry. Please, just try the pound.
I'm sure they'll be able to find...

196
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,779
- Mendez!
- Yes, lieutenant.

197
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,010
I want everything on Jessie's
love letters from his secret admirer.

198
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,417
- Chemical analysis, the works.
- I'm on the way.

199
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,284
You. I want you to get ahold
of your girlfriend.

200
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,825
This time, she gets police protection.

201
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,159
Well, Jessie's got a better shot at getting
to Megan these days than I do.

202
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,840
- Here we are. Home sweet home.
- Home?

203
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,380
After Daddy died,
I moved out of the estate...

204
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,887
...and into the apartments
here on the top floor.

205
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,355
Zoey Clark.

206
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:59,122
Clarx Toys' Clark. I love your stuff!

207
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,665
GI Johnny, OMA.

208
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,395
- <i>One Man Army</i>
- <i>One Man Army</i>

209
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:13,070
When I saw you on TV,
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.

210
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,970
No one gets you...

211
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,809
...but me.

212
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:25,924
I've spent my entire life looking
for bigger and bigger kicks.

213
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,927
Weeklong parties...

214
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,764
...joy riding...

215
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,198
...shoplifting...

216
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,704
...burglary, arson...

217
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,973
...grand theft.

218
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,878
An impressive résumé.

219
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,950
And you are the ultimate thrill.

220
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,448
There's no denying that.

221
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,488
I can't believe I finally got
the Trickster.

222
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,089
Forget the Trickster.

223
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,819
He's old news.

224
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,190
Perhaps next time I'll become...

225
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,332
...Vladimir Jessinsky, concert pianist, <i>da</i>?

226
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,131
Forget Vladimir!

227
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,634
I want the Trickster.

228
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,980
That tramp Megan Lockhart
never deserved to wear this.

229
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,781
But I do.

230
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,058
Aren't you glad to see
your little sidekick, Prank?

231
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,362
Prank.

232
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,831
Prank! Prank?

233
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,033
Yeah, baby, it's Prank.

234
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,904
And you're the Trickster.

235
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,308
Trickster.

236
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,209
Prank.

237
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,580
Thank heaven you got here in time.

238
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,917
Oh, Trickster, you're the best.

239
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,853
Forget the mushy stuff.
There is so much I have to do.

240
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,928
And I won't make
the same mistakes twice.

241
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,428
Whatever you need, I can get for you.

242
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,860
- Anything?
- Anything.

243
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,404
I have always wanted one of these.

244
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,012
Perfect!

245
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,452
The gall of this third-rate metropolis,
putting me on trial.

246
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,124
I'd do anything for you, Trickster.
Anything.

247
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,162
It's time we made
that red-suited goon pay.

248
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,196
And Megan too.

249
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,495
This time I take no prisoners...

250
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,936
...and post no bills.

251
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,003
Guess what, Central City,
the Trickster's back.

252
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,848
And I've got him.

253
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,953
Don, can this not wait till I get back?
Wait. Just hold on one second. Hello?

254
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,617
Danny, I told you, quit bugging me.

255
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,060
Hello? Yeah, Paul, I need
to speak with you. Hold on.

256
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,428
Hello? Don, I'll get back to you.
Okay.

257
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,369
Melanie, where is that package
I asked you for?

258
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,637
- This must have cost a bundle.
- Comped by the hotel.

259
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,577
Yeah, Paul. I got that fax you sent me,
and the terms are totally unacceptable.

260
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,017
Hold all of Ms. Lockhart's calls, please.
Thank you.

261
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,384
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- All I've gotten from you is a busy signal.

262
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,048
I am trying to handle
the agency in San Francisco...

263
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,889
...and juggle the media at the same time.
- I'm delighted.

264
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,258
You've got a bigger problem
than your career.

265
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,990
The Trickster? Don't I know it.

266
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,101
This came for me special delivery
this afternoon.

267
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,798
And you opened it without calling
the bomb squad or me?

268
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,671
Relax, Barry, I'm a pro. I made sure
it wasn't a bomb. Check it out.

269
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,911
Dead rat?

270
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,344
"Some discoloration
may occur after dying.

271
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,682
Love, the Trickster.
P.S., give my best to the Flash."

272
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,551
- Cute, huh?
- We'll get you round-the-clock protection.

273
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,886
I have all the protection I need,
thank you.

274
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,620
Megan, save the Sam Spade crap
for the press, all right?

275
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,232
- Jessie almost killed both of us.
- Barry, I can handle this.

276
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,459
Oh, so you don't want me around.

277
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,066
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought.

278
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,697
How would you like to move
to San Francisco?

279
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,172
- What?
- I mean, go into partnership with me...

280
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,038
...in the agency.

281
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,180
- The agency?
- Well, think about it, Barry.

282
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,747
No more being stuck behind test tubes
in the lab.

283
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,976
All the hyperspeed street work
you want.

284
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,383
- Plus you get paid really well for it.
- I like those test tubes.

285
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,556
Okay. Well, think about it.
Let me know.

286
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,596
So now on to Jessie. Look, no offense, but
the cops don't seem to be getting results.

287
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,195
Here's a list of possible hideouts.
Warehouses, theaters, amusement parks.

288
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,431
You do the legwork,
and I'll track the phony stenographer.

289
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,343
If I need to reach you, I'll call you.

290
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,749
And I need a national check on
all female mental patient escapees.

291
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,749
- You have better access at the station.
- I'm working for you?

292
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,979
I figured if we're tracking the Trickster,
I should coordinate.

293
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,385
You assume a lot.

294
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,457
This has to do with the fact
that I left town, doesn't it?

295
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,999
Look, Barry, I know we have
a lot to talk about.

296
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,401
I'll find him myself.

297
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,936
You did it again, Megan.

298
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,640
Okay, ready in the booth.

299
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,351
Ready on cameras. Four, three, two...

300
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,819
- You're on the air.
- And we are back.

301
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,018
So, what you're saying, babe...

302
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,221
...is since your partner died,
things have just not been the same.

303
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:11,028
Let's face it, babe, this dog pile of a city
refuses to recognize genius.

304
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,735
<i>Now let's cut to the chase</i>
<i>and get down to the heart of the matter.</i>

305
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,433
<i>Come on, speed-o, let's forget about</i>
<i>the little Lockhart twist.</i>

306
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,339
<i>We both know I'm gonna kill her</i>
<i>sooner or later. Unless I decide...</i>

307
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,846
Jessie, you are unbelievable.

308
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,049
<i>So I'm calling you out, babe.</i>
<i>Just you and me.</i>

309
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,622
<i>The final showdown.</i>
<i>The Thriller in Manila.</i>

310
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,753
- She said what to you tonight?
- That woman aggravates me.

311
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,487
- I don't work for her.
- At least she's mistreating you.

312
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,791
Sabrina won't even talk to me.

313
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,661
<i>The Flash versus the Trickster...</i>

314
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,631
<i>... in a final ground-pounding...</i>

315
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,432
<i>... asphalt-churning, nitro-burning</i>
<i>duel of the titans.</i>

316
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,904
<i>You know where, babe.</i>

317
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,977
<i>It's time Central City started recognizing</i>
<i>its real heroes. You know what I mean?</i>

318
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,808
<i>Good. Now get out of here.</i>
<i>I love you. You're beautiful.</i>

319
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,213
Man, does Kline need a new makeup man,
or what?

320
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,965
Not now, babe.

321
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,956
How reality stinks.

322
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,062
That's why I try and improve on it
whenever I can.

323
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,398
Well, what do you think?

324
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,062
Not too subdued?

325
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,580
Cheap harlot!

326
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,726
Hey!

327
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,219
Get them off me!

328
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,559
Get them off me!

329
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,986
- Who wants gum?
- I do. I do.

330
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,899
- Are you okay?
- No. But go get them.

331
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:24,291
You see, it's that little touch of epoxy
in the gum that does the trick.

332
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,622
Shoes.

333
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,129
Mallet.

334
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,679
Are we gonna kill him?

335
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,076
No.

336
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,616
I have a much more interesting idea.

337
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,546
Right, old buddy? Right.

338
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,939
Good morning, sunshine!

339
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,147
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood.

340
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,979
Won't you be my neighbor?

341
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,314
- Stop it, Jessie.
- The Trickster to you.

342
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,779
And I'm Prank.

343
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,794
- I thought Megan was Prank.
- I'm Prank! Me!

344
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,589
And don't you forget it.

345
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,163
- But don't you wanna see who...?
- He is the mask.

346
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:42,338
Without the mask, he's nothing.
Bupkes, nada, zip.

347
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:48,503
Just some boring, average,
insignificant jerk nobody cares about...

348
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,671
...who'll die alone and forgotten...

349
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,718
...watching game shows in
an empty apartment with cats.

350
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,288
So you touch that mask again,
I'll murder you!

351
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,049
Okay?

352
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,886
Women.

353
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,821
So, what are you gonna do, kill me?

354
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,592
The last thing I want is you dead.

355
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:16,298
With a little help, you'll come around
to my way of thinking.

356
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,277
We're gonna have so much fun together...

357
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,618
...once I reprogram your brain.

358
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,740
<i>Come to me.</i>

359
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,919
<i>Mine. Yes, you are.</i>

360
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,181
<i>Come, Flash. Oh, Flashie-poo.</i>

361
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,934
Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it!
He is such a baby.

362
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,107
- What are we gonna do now, Trickster?
- We?

363
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,802
As in, you and me?
Hey, reality check, sweetie pie.

364
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,442
You can't begin to understand
the depth and genius of my plans.

365
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,788
Besides, it's guy stuff.

366
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,225
I will make this bug house of a city
pay for the indignity...

367
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,456
...it's laid at my feet...

368
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,260
...with the help of you...

369
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,562
...my pal...

370
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,301
...the Flash.

371
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,104
I blame myself, Tina.

372
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,247
I blew it.

373
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,316
I was so caught up in paperwork
and promotions, I lost my edge.

374
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,419
Don't be silly. We're dealing
with a dangerous lunatic here...

375
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,748
...who seems to be getting help
from this Prank.

376
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,221
I'm so stupid. I mean, I care about Barry.

377
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,758
And somehow we never even
got a chance to talk.

378
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,055
And now Jessie's got him.

379
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,926
He's got radios in those wings of his,
doesn't he?

380
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,625
The transceivers proved too sensitive
for hyperspeed.

381
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,364
- And Barry hated them anyway.
- Hated being on a leash, I bet.

382
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,335
I could track his heat patterns.

383
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:35,979
I'd have to tap into the satellite system.
It would take time, and it's not legal either.

384
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,980
Maybe I should have offered you
the partnership.

385
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,847
- Partnership?
- Tina, Barry is bigger than forensics.

386
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,320
And I could really use his help
in San Francisco.

387
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,322
- He's considering the offer?
- Besides you, what's keeping him here?

388
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,827
Barry does not stay in Central City
on my account.

389
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,329
We are just good friends.
It's not like that.

390
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,369
Face it, McGee, you two are
a team, romantic or otherwise.

391
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,794
Hey, dude, your hand is, like, smoking.

392
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,758
Thanks, partner.

393
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,903
That's enough. You're under arrest.

394
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,677
You too, Flash. Don't move, or I'll shoot!

395
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,870
What are you wearing?

396
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,083
- Put it down.
- Come on. Come on.

397
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,357
It's not guns that kill people,
it's these little hard things.

398
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,823
Hey, partner, got a match?

399
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,357
- Left them in my other suit.
- No problemo.

400
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,510
Yes! Yes! Go! Go! Go!

401
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,779
Too safe and too sane.

402
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,034
Wrong one.

403
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,237
Murph, come on. Come on, Murph!

404
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,933
Murph!

405
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,580
Beautiful.

406
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,984
Wait till you see what else I got lined up.

407
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,383
I love that guy.

408
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,755
I can't believe it, Murph.
The Flash has gone bad.

409
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,063
I thought you guys
were gonna wait for me.

410
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,675
- We were having way too much fun.
- You got that right, partner.

411
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,277
You said I could fire the candle.

412
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,677
Whine, whine, whine.
You're getting to be a real drag.

413
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,951
I've had enough of your mewling
and puking.

414
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,781
Hey, forget about the ball and chain.
What next?

415
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:09,587
Well, I figure we drop the little woman
off at home, then it's boys' night out.

416
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,126
Yes, Madam Mayor,
I know he's fast.

417
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,333
I don't know how.

418
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,562
I promise you, I am doing everything
I can. Everything!

419
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,640
Okay, the Flash and the Trickster have
defaced a children's mural at the Civic...

420
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,267
...they let out the poisonous snakes
and dynamited the River Street Bridge.

421
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,744
Traffic's backed up to the state line, sir.

422
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,779
I have had better weeks. Roberts, I want
an APB on the Flash out on the wire now.

423
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,787
You notify the SWAT team
we need heavy firepower.

424
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,254
Come on, Murph.

425
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,121
What? We dig a trench,
we put tar paper over it.

426
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,524
The Flash hits that, boom,
we got him.

427
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,928
Murphy, Bellows, how about earning
your pay and hitting the streets!

428
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,159
- Yes, sir. I'm driving.
- Yes, sir!

429
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,230
Hey, has anybody seen Barry?

430
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:06,083
You and me, pal.
We'll make this city pay.

431
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,353
They called us crazy,
drove us out on the streets...

432
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,889
- Hey, this is great!
- They put us on trial.

433
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,793
- Now we'll make them think twice.
- Hey...

434
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:22,626
...I could vibrate my fingers
through somebody's brain.

435
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,498
Gross. Well, maybe later.

436
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:32,007
But seriously, we are gonna
put Central City on trial.

437
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,475
I'm ready to paint this town red.

438
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,447
Paint the town red!

439
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,288
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>the Flash has joined the Trickster...</i>

440
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,855
<i>... spreading violence and vandalism</i>
<i>through the city.</i>

441
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,186
<i>Citizens have been asked</i>
<i>to stay off the street.</i>

442
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,524
<i>The mayor is said to be requesting</i>
<i>the National Guard to quell this crime wave.</i>

443
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,326
Sorry, Al. The MAC 11 s,
did you trace them?

444
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,431
Bought by DLC Corporation.

445
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,038
A subsidiary of Clarx Toys.

446
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,538
Thanks, Al.

447
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,449
Everything the Trickster and this Prank nut
have used comes from Clarx Toys.

448
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,141
How's your search going?

449
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,378
Getting into the tracking system
is more difficult than I thought.

450
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,615
But there's a bigger problem.
He's done something to Barry's mind.

451
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,319
Maybe brainwashed him. When we do
find him, he won't be happy to see us.

452
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:28,793
Oh, great. Not only are we up
against the Trickster, but the Flash too.

453
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:33,536
If we're lucky, the Trickster's programming
won't be anything but superficial.

454
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,036
I think I can override it
with an Army technique:

455
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,767
A shot of adrenaline
to countermand the programming.

456
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,008
Good Lord, is there anything
you don't know?

457
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,142
I wish I knew more.

458
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,081
Because if this doesn't work,
Barry could die.

459
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,652
I think we should visit our local
Clarx toy store.

460
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,147
Well, if it isn't the girl from court.

461
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,308
I'm not laughing now, babe.

462
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,087
- Who are you?
- Prank.

463
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,820
Your real name.

464
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,116
- Zoey.
- Zoey what?

465
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,561
- Clark!
- Where's the Trickster?

466
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,426
- I hope he's all right.
- After what he's done to you?

467
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,295
Oh, brother.

468
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,469
Let me clue you in, honey.
I am way more unstable than you...

469
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,471
...so you better tell me where he is
right now.

470
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,235
Don't tell him I told you.

471
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,982
- He's putting the city on trial.
- Let's go, McGee.

472
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,127
Forget about her.
We gotta get to the courthouse.

473
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,559
The court of no recourse
is now in session.

474
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,465
Could we have the theme, please?

475
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,841
Will the accused come on down?

476
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,182
All right, kill the music.

477
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,546
What is the meaning of this outrage?

478
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,652
Jessie.

479
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:41,924
James, as your counsel, I strongly
advise you against taking this action.

480
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,932
You're just like all the rest:

481
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:50,005
Manipulative, faithless, self-serving.
No use to me at all.

482
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,903
You're fired!

483
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,868
Bailiff, read the charges.

484
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:02,183
"Central City and you, its representatives,
are on trial for crimes against good taste."

485
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,911
And me.

486
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,024
- This is absurd!
- I'm sure I can get a continuance on this.

487
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,757
Was I talking to you?
Has the jury reached a verdict?

488
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,026
We have, Your Honor.

489
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,258
Guilty. Guilty.

490
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,136
Guilty. Guilty.

491
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,705
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

492
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,741
Guilty. They're guilty! Guilty.

493
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,141
Guilty.

494
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,546
Any last words
before I pronounce sentence?

495
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,313
And especially you!

496
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,816
Speechless with contrition, eh?

497
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,089
I find every last one of you guilty
as sin and sentence you to death.

498
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,597
Are you prepared to carry out sentence,
Mr. Executioner?

499
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,128
No.

500
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,367
I can't decide which to use.

501
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:01,108
Well, that's why they call me
the hanging judge.

502
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,460
Well, what's stopping you, palomino?

503
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,497
I can't move.

504
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,260
An attack of conscience, eh?

505
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,260
This had to be...

506
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,506
...sooner or later.

507
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,509
I'm taking you in for good
this time, Jessie.

508
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,543
You never let us have any fun.

509
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,581
You know who I am,
and I know you're not a killer.

510
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,916
Of course you're a killer.
You're a freak of nature.

511
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,519
You can do whatever you want...

512
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,422
...because you can get away with it!

513
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,620
Don't do it, red.
You're better than that.

514
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,266
You ruined everything!

515
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,172
Kill her!

516
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,471
Kill her already!

517
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,110
- You shot my partner!
- Barry, listen to me.

518
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:13,808
The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.
He is not your partner, I am.

519
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,611
You know that!

520
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,015
We've been through hell together.

521
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,818
And I've always stood by you.
And I always will.

522
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,185
For as long as you want me to.

523
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,857
- Tina?
- Yeah.

524
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,165
Tina.

525
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,273
- Help!
- Jessie.

526
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:45,909
Body armor.

527
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,313
I'm not crazy, you know.

528
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,951
I've got a bomb...

529
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,748
...and I will use it.

530
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,391
Let her go!

531
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,837
Megan, go after Jessie. The Flash needs
a few seconds to recover.

532
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,371
- Like hell I do.
- Relax. Tina rewired that scooter of his.

533
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,494
Get in!

534
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,497
I like it.

535
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:49,112
- What is this?
- I had it made for you.

536
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,942
It's the great Trickster escape mobile.

537
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,052
For me? Gee, after I treated you
like dirt.

538
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,118
Hung you out to dry.

539
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,790
I love you madly.

540
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,620
That's why I had it equipped
with all the options.

541
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh, darling, it won't work.
I'm no good for you.

542
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:16,066
Besides, how can I miss you
when you won't go away?

543
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,688
Good evening, my dear.

544
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,452
I'm Officer Murphy,
and you are under arrest.

545
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,751
Damn!

546
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,543
Give it up, Jessie!

547
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,026
Join me in hell.

548
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,234
Where's the Flash
when you really need him?

549
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,097
Might break me out of here.

550
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:34,469
They think a padded cell can stop me.
How wrong they are.

551
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:39,082
This will be my polyfoam fortress.

552
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:44,783
They're in for such a big surprise.

553
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:49,956
Because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!

554
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,463
Thanks, Tina.

555
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,095
If you hadn't shown up, I'd still be
running around in those crazy boots.

556
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,638
What would I do without you?

557
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,140
Oh, I don't know.
Supermarket openings maybe.

558
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,869
Never.

559
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,940
Wow, I wish I'd have been in court.

560
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,016
No, you wanna stay far away
from guys like Jessie.

561
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,415
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

562
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,784
- Caught them out in the hallway.
- Julio left the concert tickets here.

563
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,948
Tickets? I thought you were breaking up.

564
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,760
Well, we had a mature discussion
about the direction of our relationship.

565
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:29,194
Yeah, he came back groveling
on his hands and knees.

566
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,164
- Well, we'd love to stay, but we got a date.
- Bye.

567
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,129
Bet those two don't make it out
to the parking lot.

568
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,536
- So you're off to San Francisco.
- Yeah.

569
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,573
We have way too many goodbyes.

570
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,713
I left something burning at the lab.
I'll see you later.

571
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,975
We make a great team, Lockhart.
See you around.

572
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,119
Yeah, you too, McGee.

573
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,220
She's great. I mean,
not your average science type.

574
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,019
Tina's the best.

575
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,159
Look, before I put my foot
in my mouth...

576
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,161
...I think I owe you an apology.

577
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,529
I've been a little preoccupied lately.

578
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,001
- This I noticed.
- I'm really sorry, Barry.

579
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:11,369
I've just been trying to keep my head
above water.

580
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,302
So have you thought
about my offer?

581
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,575
Megan, I would love to come
to San Francisco with you.

582
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,913
- God, that's terrific! Great, Barry.
- But... But I can't.

583
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,853
You can't?

584
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,512
No.

585
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,657
Central City's my home, you know?
My family is here. My friends are here.

586
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,588
I'm just not ready to say goodbye.

587
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,534
My loss.

588
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:45,132
Well, I still have a few days
before I have to head back.

589
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,736
Some of those long goodbyes.

590
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,936
More goodbyes?

591
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,083
Hey, Allen. We got work to do.

592
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,661
