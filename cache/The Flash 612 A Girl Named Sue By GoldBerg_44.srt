- This must be another Earth.

Same Earth. Another dimension.

I'm Iris West-Allen.

I'm a reporter for "The CC Citizen."

Never heard of it.

Not that it matters.

44
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,740
God, it feels so good
to have a conversation

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,980
that's not one-sided.

46
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,040
Everything is backwards.

47
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,490
Eva, you said that this place

48
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,830
was a mirror-version of our own.

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,990
How is that possible?

50
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,840
Think of it like this:{\c}

51
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,330
our reality is observed
by three dimensions:{\c}

52
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,920
width, depth, and length.

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
The superstring theory posits

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,020
that there are other realities,

55
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,080
fractal dimensions humans can't see.

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,170
So...

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,340
Two sides.

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,340
One, our world.

59
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,120
The other is just some empty reflection.

Six years ago,

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,760
I was developing the technology

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,300
to open doors to other
planes of existence.

70
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,300
I was in my office

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,890
the night Harrison Wells'
dream went up in smoke.

I've been here ever since.

76

Dark matter must have
washed over that mirror

77
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,920
and created a doorway.

I was in this office
when I got pulled in too.

But that's not all.

80
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,050
There is someone else on the
other side of that mirror,

81
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,070
another me.

82

How is that possible, Eva?

83

A fractal variable caused by the mirror.

84
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,510
A duplicate of you.

85
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,260
You mean the mirror
left a fake clone of me

then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

So why does Loring want you dead?

Because I stumbled
across his client lists,

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,560
Hey, Barr. Morning.

318
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,140
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

319
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,370
Yeah, what's up, Captain?

320
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,830
- Eh.
- Yeah, that never gets old.

321
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,900
Yeah, it kinda does. Um, listen.

322
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,420
There was a house fire on
Batton Street last month.

323
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,800
- Okay.
- The occupant died

324
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,410
of smoke inhalation.

325
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm wondering if you
could take a second look.

326
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,140
Joe, this case was already
declared an accident.

327
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah.

328
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,720
I need, uh, fresh pair of eyes on it.

329
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,990
Okay, I mean, what am I looking for?

330
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,540
Whatever you find.

331
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,400
Joe, I mean, I've got
a mountain of cases

332
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,670
I need to go through.

333
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,380
Ones that haven't been solved already.

334
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Okay, all I can say

335
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,680
is that you'd be doing me a favor.

336
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
And whatever you find, Barr,

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,150
bring it directly to me.

338
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,270
Okay.

339
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,150
Thank you.

341
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,070
John owns that warehouse.

342
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,360
That's where the deal will go down.

343
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,450
Where are you going?

344
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,700
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh, look, I get it.

346
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,910
Chivalry's your brand.

347
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,780
You're an MIT grad, speak six languages,

348
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,800
and you play polo.

349
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,610
You belong in a country
club, not in the field.

350
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,880
You belong in the 19th
Century with your Victorian,

351
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,710
save-the-damsel-in-distress crap.

352
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,810
Loring doesn't know that I'm coming,

353
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,070
so I have the element of surprise.

354
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,470
You, on the other hand,

355
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,900
he might kinda know that you're coming.

356
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,480
Translation:{\c} stay in the car, please.

So you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

374
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,010
My parents sent me
to Kyoto for a summer.

375
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,720
Trained with a blind sensei.

376
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,890
- Taught me everything I know.
- Really?

377
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,080
No. <font color="#ff00ff">[SCOFFS]</font>

378
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,150
I trained with a guy
named Frank at a YMCA.

379
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,800
Will you relax?

380
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,010
We're safe here. John's not stupid.

381
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,510
Killing me in a public place?

382
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,810
Uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

383
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,330
I'm sorry, I believe
he blew up an apartment

384
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,040
- to get to you.
- That building was scheduled

385
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,610
for demolition next month.

386
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,510
But he does know that
someone's after him now.

387
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,360
It'll make him harder to get to.

388
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,580
Thanks to you.

Where are you going?

391
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,150
Sorry, Slick.

392
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,530
I can't partner up with someone

393
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,920
who doesn't think I
can pull my own weight.

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,870
Hang on a second, Sue. Hang on.

395
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,260
Will you just hang
on one second, please?

396
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,020
Look, when I take a case,

397
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,350
I see it through to the end.

398
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
And this doesn't end until you're safe.

399
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,440
Do you trust me, Ralph?

400
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,440
I just met you.

401
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,270
But you did save my keister.

402
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,610
Twice. And that means I owe you.

403
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,030
And I always pay my debts.

404
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,200
I'll take that as a yes.

405
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,950
So...

406
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,450
- without those pictures...
- We are back to square one.

407
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,380
Fortunately, we still
have John's ledger.

408
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,120
He keeps a detailed record of every deal

409
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,510
he's ever made in it.

410
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,740
Years of evidence against him.

411
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,240
But his office is still
on the seventh floor

412
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,010
of that warehouse.

413
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,670
Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

414
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,220
But the sewer system,
that's a good way in.

415
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,770
Those tunnels, they lead
directly to the center

416
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,350
- of the building.
- And then we time our entry

417
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,430
- for when the guards...
- <font color="#138ce9">BOTH:</font> Change shifts.

418
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,660
And then we mosey up the
stairs into Loring's office,

419
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,710
we get the prize.

420
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,380
Well, you are slick.

421
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,640
Oh, my God, Ralph, you found her!

422
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,570
Oh, technically, I found him.

423
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,290
Sue Dearbon.

424
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,980
Cecile Horton. Meta-human attorney.

426
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,930
But I also have 20 years of experience

427
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,100
defending non-meta-humans.

428
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,770
The law is my game, Cecile is my name.

429
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,820
I can cover you no matter
what you've had going on

430
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,080
- all this time.
- Just need a quick word.

431
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,280
Oh, gotcha. Just one sec.

432
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,170
Listen, we're... we're...

433
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,280
we're kind of in the
middle of something.

434
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Uh, Sue's been on the
run for the last year.

435
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,260
It turns out that someone's after her.

By the way, you two? Hmm.

When I read the both
of you with my powers,

you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

Cisco asked me to hold down the fort

I lost Nora's journal.

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,230
I haven't seen it for a couple weeks.

496

And, um...

497

you know, it's the
only thing I have left

- You would know, wouldn't you?

500
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,110
Now that I think about
it, that's probably...

501
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,990
I am digging up the past,

502
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,210

There's so much unfinished business.

Maybe you should mention

by a covert organization for years.

567
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,740
I helped you get a key.

568
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,800
It's no ledger.

569
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,010
Well, Loring's ledger

570
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,900
will definitely be in the box

571

Now we know where the box is located.

All we have to do is open it.

I can call my friends at CCPD

Loring's deposit box.

We don't have a day.

584

Loring's already spooked.

585
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,340
He could move that box at any minute.

But we do this my way.

611
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,370
We get inside, get the ledger,

612
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,740
and immediately bring
it to my friends at CCPD.

613
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,380
Deal or no deal?

614
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,680
Deal.

615

616
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,580
- These scorch marks.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,850
They're giant burns like

You think there's a mole here?

Carver's influence runs deep, man.

636
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,300
Okay, all right, um,

637
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,470
look, this is what Iris
is already investigating.

638
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,060
Her lead had to do with the mirror gun

639
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,330
that we stole from McCulloch
Technologies last year.

640
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,760
It fell through because
I wouldn't give it to her.

641
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
Why didn't you give it to her?

642
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,060
- I mean, was it dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah.

643
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,270
I mean, it could put her in danger.

644
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,860
Yeah, I don't trust
what the world might do

645
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,950
if that gun got out there.

646
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,450
Yeah, well, the world is crazy,

647
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,820
but it's clear that
Carver is really dangerous.

648
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,340
Iris is your partner and family,

649
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,180

A credible tip came in to CCPD

saying this branch was a
target for robbery, so yes.

Well, this is the only

Opening or closing it

It just wasn't me.

The truth is,

I always hated the
whole socialite scene.

703
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,810
Which is why, one day,
I woke up and realized

704
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,670
I had no idea who I was.

705
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,860

I was a cop. A damn good one.
