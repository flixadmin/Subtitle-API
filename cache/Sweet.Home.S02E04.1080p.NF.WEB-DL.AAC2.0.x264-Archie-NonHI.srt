00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,105
<i>Please halt your actions</i>
<i>and return to your stations.</i>

6
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,984
<i>Five minutes to roll call.</i>

7
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,737
<i>Return to your assigned living quarters</i>
<i>and get ready for roll call.</i>

8
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,867
- Dad, wait for me!
- <i>Please inspect your living quarters</i>

9
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,370
<i>for any missing individuals</i>

10
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>Survivors will also be barred</i>
<i>from participating in this expedition.</i>

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>For the time being,</i>

12
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,006
<i>survivors will be barred</i>
<i>from engaging on expeditions.</i>

13
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,843
<i>The decision was made</i>
<i>for the sake of the survivors' protection.</i>

14
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>The Crow Platoon requests</i>
<i>your confidence and cooperation.</i>

15
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,726
<i>Please check on your neighbors to see</i>
<i>if there are any missing persons.</i>

16
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>Over.</i>

17
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,091
Give it back to me!

18
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,344
Give it back to me!

19
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,639
When did he get this scar?

20
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,641
It's from last night.

21
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,685
It looks fresher than that.

22
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
Sir, it doesn't seem serious.

23
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,314
What would you know about it?

24
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,525
We have to be sure.

25
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,194
Just… Just let him go.

26
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,278
He's just a child, sir.

27
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,780
Kids can be monsters too.

28
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,114
There are no exceptions.

29
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,033
Then I'll do it myself.

30
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,451
You should've done it last night.

31
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,123
Start with me.

32
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,003
Good enough?

33
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,091
I should be extra thorough with you.

34
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,094
You're a murderer, after all.

35
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,682
Enough, sir. We have more urgent matters.

36
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,322
Here, sir.

37
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,658
Is this good enough?

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,205
Let's go.

39
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,629
Ma'am, are you all right?

40
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,591
It's my insides. I'm in horrible pain.

41
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,350
Uh, here's some aspirin. This should help.

42
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,729
Oh, God. I don't know what to say.

43
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,522
Uh… Oh, God.

44
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,317
How could I ever return the favor?

45
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,361
Thank you so much. You're so kind.

46
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,321
I'll be going now.

47
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,378
Ma'am?

48
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,505
Can you tell me where your son is?

49
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,633
Huh?

50
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,468
You haven't seen my son?

51
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,140
No, sir. Wait a minute. Hold on, please.

52
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,727
Oh Jun-il, number 211, unaffiliated,
is missing in Area A.

53
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,063
Oh, God.

54
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,357
Hey. Hey.

55
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
How did you get in here?

56
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,034
Did you skip roll call?

57
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,870
I… I…

58
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,413
I want to come with you.

59
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,331
What for?

60
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,167
To get killed?

61
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,127
No, to… Um, uh…

62
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,587
To kill.

63
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,382
Right, you wanna kill monsters, huh?

64
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,218
I heard you never even served in the army.

65
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,470
Do you even have a gun?

66
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,638
Uh, no, I don't.

67
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,557
You couldn't join
because you didn't buy a gun?

68
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,684
Didn't your mom buy you a gun? No?

69
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,894
Come on, Sarge.

70
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,729
Give him a break.

71
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,943
Don't… Don't fucking make fun of me,
all right?

72
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,320
Or you're gonna die!

73
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,242
That's enough.

74
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,205
Just leave and get your ass to sleep.

75
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,040
What are you doing?

76
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,500
Sir.

77
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,126
Is this a picnic?

78
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,336
Not this again, Sarge.

79
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,755
Come on,
they were just letting off some steam.

80
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,347
You need to remain alert.

81
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,058
Today's mission will be
at an unknown site.

82
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,392
- This will be unlike any…
- Let's get out of here.

83
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,936
- Hold on.
- …of our previous expeditions, understood?

84
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,312
Yes, sir.

85
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,980
We'll go in five minutes. Be ready.

86
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,107
Is the danger even real?

87
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,906
Or are your so-called excursions
an excuse for keeping the riches?

88
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,200
What the hell did you say, you idiot, huh?

89
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,117
Am I wrong?

90
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
You used to take
as many survivors as you could.

91
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,829
What's up with recent ban?

92
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,874
You even turned a blind eye to the murder.

93
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,460
I just find it
really hard to believe that…

94
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,170
you're suddenly looking out for us!

95
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
Take this. It's dangerous.

96
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,518
So, can I really go out?

97
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,811
Isn't that what you wanted?

98
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,853
Yeah.

99
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,355
That's what I wanted.

100
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,858
Okay then. Good luck.

101
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,444
- Huh?
- What's wrong?

102
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,365
I mean, isn't the Crow Platoon
supposed to protect--

103
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,283
"Supposed to"?

104
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,743
Sir, I'm sorry, that's not--

105
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,288
We're putting our lives
on the line for you.

106
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,124
If you're so sure of your skills,
fend for yourselves out there.

107
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,960
It won't be long
until you learn to acknowledge

108
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,087
the peace you've grown so accustomed to.

109
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
You can go.

110
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,762
We won't stop you.

111
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108
Goddamnit.

112
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,624
That son of a bitch! I swear to God!

113
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,167
He's not jack shit without a gun.

114
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,877
- I know that much.
- Keep it down, okay? They'll hear you.

115
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,503
- Be quiet.
- Let them hear for all I care!

116
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,089
What's he gonna do about it, huh?
They can't touch us no matter what we do!

117
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,258
- But still--
- Jesus Christ, shut up!

118
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,843
Stop being such a wuss!

119
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,345
Think of it this way.

120
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,930
That Crow Platoon,
they're basically glorified bodyguards

121
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:40,973
- protecting us.
- I get it. I get it.

122
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,725
They can't protect us and hurt us.

123
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,853
- They can all go to hell!
- Be quiet.

124
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,606
Don't go, it's not worth it.

125
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,191
Not everyone feels like that.

126
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,693
It's because of you, we're still alive.

127
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,200
Don't touch it.

128
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,826
It'll take time to heal.

129
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,161
We all have to do it.

130
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,621
I'm fine.

131
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,706
Don't worry, be patient.

132
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,333
I'll bring some today.

133
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,431
<i>And are you dating anyone, Sarge?</i>

134
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,019
A lot of our boys are seeing someone
on the down low, you know what I'm saying?

135
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,771
- Are you?
- I can't.

136
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,649
Unless you start dating,
I can't wreck the chain of command.

137
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,818
I feel no need for it.

138
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,404
Is it because you couldn't find
the right person?

139
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,240
It's just…

140
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,991
Well, I've been thinking, and I mean…

141
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,743
You're good-looking and a survivor,

142
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,704
you're good at killing monsters
and as a leader.

143
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,872
You're a prize catch in today's standards.

144
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,874
So why can't you get a girl?

145
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,921
How can you afford
these meaningless distractions?

146
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,007
You always have a frown in your face, sir.

147
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,010
The boys can't speak to you
and they're too afraid.

148
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,429
You should smile a little.

149
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,848
Okay, cut the BS now.

150
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,558
How much firepower do we have left?

151
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,186
Well, I have some grenades
and explosives on me as well.

152
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,896
But we're low on ammo.

153
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,525
We got a box of incendiary,
but only three boxes of regular ammo left.

154
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,443
Fuel?

155
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,529
If we don't find any,
this thing becomes junk.

156
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,659
Then maybe take your mind off my love life
and start worrying about those issues.

157
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,662
Understood, sir.

158
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,419
<i>Where were you?</i>

159
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,628
How could you go out there?

160
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,255
- You know how dangerous it is.
- Let go, Mom. That hurts.

161
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,382
- Please. Stop it, Mom! Stop!
- What the hell were you thinking?

162
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,510
You know better.
How could you be so careless?

163
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,137
Please calm down, ma'am.

164
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,472
He returned safely.

165
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,932
You're 30 now.
You're not a child, you know.

166
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,895
For God's sakes,
you're an adult now, Jun-il.

167
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,147
I won't be here for you forever.

168
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,358
Oh, Jun-il.

169
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,780
You've got to start acting like an adult,
you understand?

170
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,656
Why do you keep going outside?

171
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,241
Medicine.

172
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,826
What?

173
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,995
I go because you need medicine.

174
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,586
{\an8}Your disease makes you bite down hard
in order to bear the pain.

175
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,840
They all fell out because you kept bit…
biting down so hard.

176
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,719
I don't like seeing you in pain.

177
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,472
Oh, whoa.

178
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,353
Oh, God.

179
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,987
{\an8}I have to go now.

180
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,535
He was trying to help me here,

181
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,578
so if you could ignore this once.

182
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,041
He wouldn't skip roll call
to cause trouble elsewhere, you know.

183
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,836
He's really a good boy.

184
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,633
Don't worry about it too much.

185
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,388
I couldn't hide my sickness from him.

186
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,268
He's seen me sick in bed for years
for most of his childhood.

187
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,854
Uh…

188
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,481
Is it even treatable?

189
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,776
I have cancer.

190
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:26,031
Ever since last month,
I feel like my insides are rotting away.

191
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,077
I know it's a relapse.

192
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,038
I would've made peace with death

193
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,291
a long time ago
if it weren't for him, but…

194
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,544
I was so concerned about Jun-il

195
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,504
that I clung on for dear life.

196
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,424
But I think my time has finally run out.

197
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,178
The thought of

198
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,932
leaving him alone in this world just…

199
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,411
You said they'd let us go
if we came in and got in their faces.

200
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,165
For once, I was really hoping
to fill my stomach.

201
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,208
But I guess
that's just not happening today.

202
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,793
You idiot.

203
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,130
If your only goal is to fill your stomach,
then don't call yourself a man.

204
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,508
- I can't take it anymore.
- So they thought they could bully us

205
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,593
into backing down.

206
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,555
What are you planning now?
For once, could you stop causing trouble?

207
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,015
Let's go.

208
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,767
Where are we going?

209
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,145
To the person
those soldiers are afraid of.

210
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,356
Chief Ji, are you there?

211
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,986
Ma'am.

212
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,445
It's me, Do Sang-jin.

213
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,412
Oh. Hello, ma'am. I hope you've been well.

214
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,375
I thought I told you not to come here.

215
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,753
It's a bit urgent.

216
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,754
What is it?

217
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,008
This ban on expeditions,
I can't stand it anymore.

218
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,176
What do you want me to do?

219
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,511
Please help us out.

220
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,597
I know you're not
the Crow Platoon's biggest fan either.

221
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,224
You and Gi-nam

222
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,476
were the ones that took all those people

223
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,854
and let them live here after the bombing.

224
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,898
But now those pricks act
like they own the place.

225
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,695
And they turned a blind eye
to what happened to Gi-nam too.

226
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,367
Sorry I said that.

227
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,994
That was out of line.

228
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,412
If you're hungry, work.

229
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,497
There's work to do today.

230
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm only interested in going out there.

231
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,042
Why do you wanna go?

232
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,752
I don't wanna live like an animal.

233
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,088
Trapped underground, barely scraping by,
one breath at a time,

234
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,506
- this is no way to live.
- We're all okay.

235
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,632
Don't be dramatic.

236
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,009
Don't be like that, come on.

237
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,845
Please strike up a deal
on behalf of the survivors.

238
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,889
The Crow Platoon do what they do,
I do what I do.

239
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,891
We don't interfere with each other.

240
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,354
But that doesn't mean I can't help.

241
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,857
If you help me.

242
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,775
How?

243
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,653
Don't you wanna go out?

244
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,742
PLEASE COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY
TO RESTORE ORDER AND SAFETY

245
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,500
{\an8}SHELTER ADMISSION PROTOCOL

246
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,440
<i>The security's down, sir.</i>

247
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,818
Nothing to report.

248
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,987
Open the gate. We're moving out.

249
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,539
BEER

250
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,420
{\an8}FRENCH PHRASEBOOK

251
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,882
{\an8}Sounds filthy.

252
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,383
{\an8}CURRY POWDER

253
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,896
Hey, stop! No!
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,397
Have you gone mad?

255
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,608
- Please, I'm… Let me have some.
- No.

256
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,860
- Come on.
- Let go, you crazy bitch!

257
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,864
Stop it!

258
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
Jesus Christ!

259
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,077
Come on, give it back.

260
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,747
Giving is giving,
taking back is stealing.

261
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,625
I never gave it to you.
You stole it.

262
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,878
You understood me?

263
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,296
You speak French now?

264
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,006
You're not really crazy, are you?

265
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,467
You're just pretending to be crazy
to leech off my mom, right?

266
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,306
{\an8}Mm. It's the pretty girl.

267
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,683
{\an8}Well, all the pretty girls
end up becoming monsters.

268
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,518
Where's the Chief?

269
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,481
Mom's gone off to work.
Unlike you, she's busy, you know.

270
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,608
No one here is lazy as you are.

271
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,525
Hey.

272
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,325
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't see
any blonde-red ones in your last shipment.

273
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,661
What do you mean? They're all red.

274
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,412
Red comes in a variety of colors.

275
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,166
Go find me one.

276
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,293
So, it's "blonde-red."

277
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,511
Tell me, was my dad's blood
more like this shade of crimson,

278
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,637
or this one?

279
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,983
Are you fucking insane?

280
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,986
You just figured that out?
I've been insane for a while now.

281
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,697
But I can get even more insane than that.

282
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,116
I know I haven't reached
my full potential.

283
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,870
So I would recommend…

284
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,165
to please watch your mouth.

285
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,640
Ah, fuck me.

286
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,100
Fold.

287
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,945
I'll see your two million,
and I'm doubling it.

288
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
Damn it, I'm out.

289
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,577
Oh, feel free to pussy out
if you're scared, hmm?

290
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,882
Uh, do you… even have gambling privileges?

291
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,926
Are you babbling or playing, Seung-wan?

292
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,637
Hmm?

293
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,141
Fine, I lose. I lose. I fold.

294
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,643
Come on, just start the next round.
Start the next round. Next round.

295
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,438
I had nothing.

296
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,523
You were bluffing?

297
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,486
Survived all the way till the end.

298
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,446
That's how you succeed in this world.

299
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,697
Let's play.

300
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,310
Hey, hey, hey.

301
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,645
This is an unverified area.

302
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,230
I don't think we should be in here.

303
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,732
Well, it's only unverified to us.

304
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,068
But Chief Ji knows where everything is

305
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,070
and which pathways lead where.

306
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,364
Chief Ji gave us permission. Period.

307
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,366
Oh, shit.

308
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,493
Who the hell is this guy?

309
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,003
Should we bring him along?

310
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,921
What? What for?

311
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,549
Well, I mean, we don't know
what lies ahead after all.

312
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,310
Slow down.

313
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,189
We've entered the unverified area.

315
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,648
Moving in on the search point.

316
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
All troops, stay alert
in your respective positions.

317
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,299
Ready to go ahead.

318
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,218
Survey the area.

319
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,440
Start searching.

320
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
Hey, hey, hey! How's the coast?

321
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,361
I-I-It's clear.

322
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,238
Clear? Okay, good.

323
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,769
So she told her about this path?

324
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,688
Why would the chief do that?

325
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,315
So she'll fuck off and die.

326
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,399
That's horrible.

327
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,401
I mean, the bitch killed her husband.

328
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,194
So I don't think
she was doing her a favor.

329
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,780
Yeah, I guess that's true.

330
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,491
But why wouldn't she say anything?

331
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,201
How does she want us to help her out?

332
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,623
She keeps venturing off alone
and making it back alive.

333
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,207
Chief told us about this

334
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,168
so we could snoop on her.

335
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,253
Let's go.

336
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,631
Jun-il, take the lead.

337
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,965
Huh?

338
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,553
But… But I was told I'm not supposed
to go outside alone.

339
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,804
Not alone.

340
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,640
We're going with you.

341
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,268
You know, bud?

342
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,729
You should get food for your mom
while she still has teeth.

343
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,439
Right?

344
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,523
Mm.

345
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,109
Ugh. Damn it.

346
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,537
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

347
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,451
What the hell is she doing?

348
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,875
Hey, she's on the move.
Let's get out of here.

349
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,043
Come on, let's just return.
We've got what we need.

350
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,879
We don't care about her.
We'll find an excuse.

351
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,088
Let's kill her.

352
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,008
What?

353
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,678
I mean, with that bitch
out of the picture,

354
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,388
everything would be ours.

355
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,474
But she ordered us just to watch her.

356
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,809
She'd love it if we'd kill her for her.

357
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,896
We had it all wrong!

358
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:37,025
She, uh… She did send us out
so we can kill her husband's killer!

359
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,110
What are you talking about?
She said nothing of the sort.

360
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,820
Does she have to spell it out for you?

361
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,988
Read between the lines.

362
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,742
Oh, my God.

363
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,621
Oh, this is so fucked up.

364
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,747
Shit.

365
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,673
I have my own gun now.

366
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,592
- Like a real soldier.
- Give that to me.

367
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,093
Damn it.

368
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,679
Dude, where'd you get this gun?

369
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,066
Stay alert.

370
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,208
Hold your fire.

371
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,253
Alpha, classify it.

372
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,755
The rest of you, be ready to open fire.

373
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,170
Type Green.

374
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,091
Let's just get rid of it.

375
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,718
We're low on fuel.

376
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,386
It's a pointless fight.

377
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,680
Yeah?

378
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,730
What's up with that thing?

379
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,523
It's freaking disgusting.

380
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,652
Don't be mean, sir.

381
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,570
It's crying, for God's sake.

382
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,447
You said, "It's crying"?

383
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
Hey.

384
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,701
Those things bark, they don't cry.
What are you talking about?

385
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,370
That looks like crying to you?

386
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,246
To me, it looks like it's laughing…

387
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,716
- What's going on?
- Ugh.

388
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,259
You didn't tell us you had a girlfriend.

389
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,803
What are you talking about?

390
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,638
So, she's into baldies, huh?

391
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,683
But if we're in its territory,
shouldn't we be fine?

392
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,393
This is good then. You.

393
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,895
Take your girl and put her over there.

394
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,981
Just be nice to her.
She's a nuisance right now.

395
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,774
I can't entertain a monster.

396
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,234
Huh?

397
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,028
- Go to that church.
- Huh?

398
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,073
Once you're there,
put a ring on its finger.

399
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,199
We're proud.

400
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,367
Ugh!

401
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,328
Fuck me.

402
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,631
<i>I heard we're repairing the outer wall.</i>

403
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,133
Really? Isn't that dangerous?

404
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,843
Nah, we'll be escorted
by the Crow Platoon.

405
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,220
- Besides, nothing happened last time.
- Well, when you put it that way,

406
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,431
I guess it's a lot better
than going on an expedition.

407
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,434
Sure, it's safe, but the real issue
is that we don't get much from it.

408
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,562
To be honest, we get close to nothing
in terms of rations.

409
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,148
Going on such expeditions
was a really wonderful job.

410
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,691
We can get drunk, right?

411
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,651
Damn, I should've thought of it.

412
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,362
- Now I want booze.
- Where are we going today for work?

413
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,366
Wait a minute. You're really here to work?

414
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,993
Well, a man's gotta eat, you know.

415
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,037
He can't be serious.

416
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,747
Guess his gambling money has run out.

417
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,665
I can't believe
how arrogant you are, dude.

418
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,125
Why would Chief Ji take you, huh?

419
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,501
He's right.

420
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,545
Just scamper off somewhere else.

421
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,213
- Jesus!
- Huh? Get the hell out of here.

422
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,674
I won't go.
I mean, why should I have to do that?

423
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,384
What the hell did I do wrong?

424
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,469
Are you for real, man?

425
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,763
Aren't you from that witch's family?

426
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,264
That's not true!

427
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,059
Oh! My God! My name is Kang! Jesus Christ!

428
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,812
I don't even have a drop of blood
in common with Lee Eun-yu!

429
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,816
When you have a sworn enemy,
you hate anyone with an association.

430
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,944
Chief Ji's only letting you people
stay here because she's a good person.

431
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,822
But we should've cut you
and your lot loose a long time ago.

432
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,033
- Assholes!
- What did you say, you fucker?

433
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:37,992
Nothing, sir.

434
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,452
- Let it go.
- Prick.

435
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,621
Shit.

436
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,622
Damn.

437
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,668
Um… Ms… Ms. Jung?

438
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,337
Um, could you, um…

439
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,464
Could you put in a good word
to the chief for me

440
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,466
so I can go out and…

441
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,385
Again, why do you keep
bringing this up with me?

442
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,346
Everything they said was legitimate.

443
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,849
Well, it's just, you know, uh,
it feels unfair, that's all.

444
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
You have Lee Eun-yu to thank for that.

445
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,187
That crazy bitch put you in this position.

446
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
Oh, I was embarrassed.

447
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,149
Mom!

448
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,401
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi, Chief Ji.

449
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,570
- Mom.
- Hi, everyone.

450
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,782
How's your back?

451
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,325
All better now, Chief, thanks to you.

452
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,660
- Feeling all right?
- Yeah.

453
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,996
Hello, everyone.

454
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,039
Hello.

455
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,877
Today, we'll be repairing
the east side of the outer wall.

456
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,588
Since we're going outside,
we have to be extra careful.

457
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,382
Please understand that only a few can go.

458
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,592
- Mr. Yoon?
- Yes, Chief?

459
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,678
- Where's Cheol-yong? Right.
- Right here, ma'am.

460
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,388
- Mr. Kim.
- Thank you, ma'am.

461
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,848
- And, uh, Jae-chan.
- Yes.

462
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,932
Seok-chan.

463
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,392
- Skinny!
- Here!

464
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,563
And lastly…

465
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,359
Seung-wan.

466
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
Yes?

467
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,612
Oh. Yeah!

468
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,323
Let's try to get this done
before sundown, all right?

469
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

470
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,118
Oh.

471
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,037
Right, I can do this. I can do this.

472
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,498
That's all.
Back to what you were doing, everyone.

473
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,209
Return to your stations.

474
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,089
She's such a joke. I swear.

475
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,716
She's just a freaking joke.

476
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,384
Why would she pick that lazy bastard?

477
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,385
Hey, come on.

478
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,012
Watch your mouth.

479
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,933
She's the one who keeps this place
running with electricity and all.

480
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,353
I even gave her a heart,
and now I'm hurt I didn't get to go.

481
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,396
I get it.

482
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,108
Come to the testimony meeting.

483
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,447
Do attend and hear the good word.

484
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
And just unload all that pent-up stress.

485
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,286
Thank you so much.

486
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,663
I'll give you one if you attend.

487
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,295
Come and relieve your suffering.

488
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,506
And do the job you have to do.

489
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,551
Why let a pretty face like that
go to waste?

490
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,054
Don't you think, Jin-a?

491
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,270
Go to the right.

492
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,462
SUNGIL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

493
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,492
Oh!

494
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,411
Chief Ji.

495
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,454
Couldn't you squeeze me in as well?

496
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,956
It's tough work.

497
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,082
I'll be fine, I swear.

498
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,002
I used to work an entire farm myself,
you know.

499
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,253
Sorry, I can't.

500
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,130
It's just…

501
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,216
…you give more pay
to those who work, right?

502
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,220
You know I'm old, but not a burden.

503
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
And I could really use some sun.

504
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,351
I need to get some exercise. Please.

505
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,522
I'll take half
of what you pay the others, okay?

506
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,441
Ma'am, that's not the issue.

507
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,603
That's all mine, you know.

508
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,609
Yeah, right.

509
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,987
See those housing complexes over there?

510
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,739
And those around the corner?

511
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,741
They're all mine, so…

512
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,994
No way.

513
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,662
I'm so much richer than you are.

514
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,624
Give me some money then.
I deserve it, don't I?

515
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,751
Why would I do that?

516
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,628
You take me for a chump.

517
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,130
Okay, just calm down, would you?

518
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,349
That guy is as handsome as ever, my God.

519
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,185
I swear.
Look how attractive he is.

520
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,648
Such an idiot.

521
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,571
Whoa, look.

522
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,907
My God, just look at that smile.

523
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,410
Oh, he's just irresistible.

524
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,454
Sounds like you're in love.

525
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,414
Huh?

526
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,208
Just follow your heart.

527
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,793
Or you could regret it, you know.

528
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
Yeah.

529
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,797
That's why I'm getting myself a makeover.

530
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,049
The sunlight needs to hit my hair evenly.

531
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,676
I can't ask him out with splotchy hair.

532
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,537
Look. They're running!

533
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,248
Look! Someone's running away!

534
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,640
Where's that jackass off to now?

535
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,685
I wish I could beat
the shit out of that idiot.

536
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,022
- Wait up. What about him?
- Screw him!

537
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,037
Ah! Fucking bitch!

538
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,213
Oh, God. Hey, man!

539
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,469
Bitch!

540
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,847
That damn little bitch.

541
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,003
Park Chan-yeong! Chan-yeong!

542
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,093
Chan-yeong!

543
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,052
Mom!

544
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,136
Mom!

545
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,556
My God, what's going on?

546
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,895
Hold it!

547
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,064
Watch your feet!

548
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,657
Ma'am, don't lift your foot.

549
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,908
Don't move at all.

550
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,541
Why did you come all the way out here?

551
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,297
I wanted to leave.

552
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,559
I wanted to disappear quietly,
but I guess that was too much to ask.

553
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,771
All that nonsense
about accepting death with grace is a lie.

554
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,362
I'm… really scared.

555
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,116
I just wanna keep on living.

556
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,620
Despite my old age and all.

557
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,081
You know, with how old I am now…

558
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,084
I still wanna keep living.

559
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,549
Listen, I can't stand here
for much longer.

560
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,717
Back off now.

561
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,678
Both of you, there's no reason
to injure yourself

562
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,263
for a useless old lady like me.

563
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,312
I just cause trouble for everyone.

564
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,398
Don't get any closer!
I told you not to come! Don't!

565
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,069
There, give me your hand.

566
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,448
Do you know how to disarm that thing?

567
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,408
I don't.

568
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,412
Just hold on, ma'am.

569
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,247
Help will be on its way shortly.

570
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,493
You're… you're not supposed to sleep here.

571
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,220
Hey.

572
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,763
Wake up.

573
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,109
<i>Medicine. I don't like seeing you in pain.</i>

574
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,361
{\an8}Mom?

575
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,041
I didn't do that.

576
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:16,959
Mom…

577
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,420
Mom, ill.

578
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,555
You did this to yourself.

579
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,975
This isn't my fault.

580
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,996
What-What's going on?
Did something go wrong out there?

581
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,540
No, no, no,
we just need to go back inside, okay?

582
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,250
We just need to return inside.

583
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,752
- Whoa, it opened.
- No, let's go inside.

584
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,005
- Hurry up.
- All right, let's wrap it up for today.

585
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,381
- Please get inside, everyone. Come on.
- Yeah. Right.

586
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,633
- Let's do what Chief Ji said.
- Let me go through! Where's my Chan-yeong?

587
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,803
- There's nothing you can do, all right?
- I can't leave him out there.

588
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,805
You have to. It's not up to us.
Get back inside.

589
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,557
Mom. You can't leave him alone.

590
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,517
All right, everyone, come on.
Try to go back in.

591
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,061
Let me go.
You can't leave him out there! Let me go!

592
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,646
You gotta let go!

593
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,356
Park Chan-yeong! Come back in here!

594
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,275
Come back alive! Come back, please!

595
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,860
Calm down.

596
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,920
That's enough. Go now.

597
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,630
Why would I do that?

598
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,549
Because I need to ask a favor.

599
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,179
I left without even saying
a proper goodbye to Jun-il.

600
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,806
He'll think I abandoned him…

601
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,935
if I die like this, you understand?

602
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,270
Tell him that's not how it was.

603
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,483
Please tell him I would never abandon him.

604
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,984
You'll tell him yourself.

605
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,154
Something so important
should be said in person.

606
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,198
How long has it been?

607
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,705
I really don't know.

608
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,582
Step aside.

609
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,043
I'm sorry, sir.

610
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,169
I can't do that.

611
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,214
She's only alive
because she's not a monster yet.

612
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,633
The mine should've exploded,

613
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,760
but it's most likely broken.

614
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,013
So, um… will she be all right, sir?

615
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,057
It's pure conjecture for the time being.

616
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,394
Your hand will blow off
if you keep pressing down.

617
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,645
Now move away.

618
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,215
There's no guarantee that it won't go off
after she takes her foot off.

619
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,801
And it's hard to predict
the range on this thing for sure.

620
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,221
Sir, if you don't mind, I'd like
your permission to do everything we can.

621
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,018
You could end up dead if things go wrong.

622
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,188
But to me,
that sounds like there's a possibility.

623
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,659
Please, let's just go back, okay? Come on!

624
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,497
Ready or not, here I come,
wherever you are.

625
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,875
She's not here.
Let's just go now!

626
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,046
Tiny girl.

627
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,258
Ready or not, here I come.

628
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,894
Jesus Christ, let's just head back, okay?

629
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,522
Shut up.

630
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,857
Or I'll tear your tongue out.

631
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,799
Let's just go, okay?

632
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,259
Come on.

633
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,791
Hey.

634
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,960
It's just a little girl.

635
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,462
Exactly.

636
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,839
What a relief. Yeah.

637
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,845
You're crazy.

638
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,433
Hey.

639
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,435
Are you all right?

640
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,187
You're not dead, are you?

641
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,563
Hey, kid.

642
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,543
Wait a second. Those are human eyes.

643
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,214
Hey. Get lost.

644
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,216
Get the hell out of here.

645
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,261
What the fuck?

646
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,559
It's a monster. A monster.

647
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,271
Get lost, you idiot.

648
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,189
Oh.

649
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,358
Goodbye then.

650
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,833
Damn it!

651
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,424
Everything here is mine.

652
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,593
No one else can have this.

653
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,809
I will kill every last one of you,
you fuckers!

654
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,061
All right.

655
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,688
No one will know about this.

656
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,151
All right.

657
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,797
Is that all we can get today?

658
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,260
All that's left is useless junk
aside from some hand-to-hand explosives.

659
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,262
This place has been swept already.

660
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,806
Good to know
there are other survivors out there.

661
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,975
I'm pissed they beat us to it.

662
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,518
Kim, come here.

663
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,020
Let's search over there.

664
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,104
We'll beat them this time.

665
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,647
No. Too much rain.

666
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,983
We'll head back for now.

667
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,234
Sergeant Kim!

668
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,571
Staff Sergeant Choi has gone missing.

669
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,781
What about his comms?

670
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,240
Beacons?

671
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,283
His radio's off.

672
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,577
He hasn't responded.

673
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,497
Hey, Yong-seok's missing.
Who saw him last?

674
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,248
I saw him heading towards the mall, sir.

675
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,126
We can't search for him.
And the area's just way too vast.

676
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,211
So what?

677
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
You want to ditch him and leave?

678
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,465
Would you abandon him
if he was your brother?

679
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,634
That's a useless distinction.
We're all brothers here.

680
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,428
You're the one that referred to him
like a total stranger, you punk.

681
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,800
Get up, ma'am.

682
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,111
That came from the camp, right?

683
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,030
Kang Seok-chan.

684
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,031
Yes, sir.

685
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,534
Was there any evidence of blood
or struggle back at the mall?

686
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,369
No, sir.

687
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,037
Then we'll return for now.

688
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,291
- What about Yong-seok?
- The stadium comes first.

689
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,795
We brought most of the firepower with us.
We have to return.

690
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,547
Provided Yong-seok isn't harmed,

691
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,632
he can make it back alone.

692
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,969
Then if not, we'll go look for him.

693
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,346
We have to go.

694
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:57,849
Let's go.

695
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,101
- We're heading back.
- Prepare to head back!

696
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,844
Eun-hyeok.

697
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,807
Eun-hyeok.

698
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,109
It's you, isn't it?

699
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,529
It was you last time.

700
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,740
It must be you. I'm certain.

701
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,968
Eun-hyeok.

702
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,348
Eun-hyeok!

703
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,810
Eun-hyeok!

704
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,733
Can you show yourself, please?
Just this once, please?

705
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,446
Come out and just stop running away.

706
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,531
Show yourself, please, for me.

707
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:27,160
I don't care what you look like now,
so, please, just let me see you.

708
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,620
Eun-hyeok.

709
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,706
Eun-hyeok.

710
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,960
Show yourself just… Come on.

711
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:39,005
Come on, please. I'm begging you.

712
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,091
Please…
