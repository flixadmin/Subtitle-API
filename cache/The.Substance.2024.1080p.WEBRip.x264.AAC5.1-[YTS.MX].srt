392
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:23,208
(water running)

393
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:36,250
(eerie music)

394
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:44,541
(screaming)

395
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:53,500
Where have you been?

396
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:55,416
I've all been wanting

397
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,666
to have a drink with you

398
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,708
for your departure.

399
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,208
Anyway, we all chipped in

400
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,458
and we got you just a little

401
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,083
something to keep you busy.

402
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,166
It's French.

403
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,458
My wife, she's for her spire.

404
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,458
Oh, I don't want my wife.

405
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,541
Oops, I gotta run.

406
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,500
But it's always great to see you.

407
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:21,708
(chuckling)

408
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:38,625

409
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,541

The antelope and the deer moving about

416
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,500
are going through the text.

417
00:46:52,916 --> 00:47:07,625

(upbeat music)

421
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,833
The antelope with remotes.

422
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,541
I cannot believe the

423
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,166
incredible price for $49.98.

424
00:47:50,416 --> 00:48:07,583

435
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,083
God dammit, they have the phone

436
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,125
and it's such a great night.

437
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,375
Open up.

438
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,000
We gotta open up.

439
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,750
And uh, sorry.

440
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,250
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

441
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,333
She moved out.

442
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:51,625
I'm the new tenant.

443
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,083
Sue.

444
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:56,333
Oliver.

445
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:57,583
Oliver.

446
00:49:59,625 --> 00:49:59,875
Oliver.

447
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,083
You wanted to complain about something?

448
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:03,750
Oliver?

449
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:05,583
What?

450
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:06,916
No.

451
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

452
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,083
I think it's like

453
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,375
awesome when there's stuff

454
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:12,958
going on in the

455
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:13,958
building, you know what I mean?

456
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,208
Um, I'm actually,

457
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,916
quite handy if you ever need,

458
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,000
need me to be of aid in any way.

459
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:28,083
I got a sack of tools

460
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,875
and I got a big hammer.

461
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:34,958
You know what I mean.

462
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,958
(laughing) Anyways, I live right here,

463
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
so you know where to find me.

464
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,291
Anytime.

465
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,500
Day or night.

466
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,750
Later.

467
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,333
(ominous music)

468
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,333
(door creaking)

469
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,333

471
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,083
Hi everybody.

472
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,583
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

473
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:47,416
Are you ready?

474
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:48,666
Let's go.

475
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,083

Thank you so much everybody.

479

I'll see you next week.

480
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,500
And in the meantime,

481
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,375
take care of yourself.

482
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:36,916
courtesy!

483
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:39,458
(cheering)

484
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,166
Wonderful, wonderful.

485
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:45,375
(applause)

486
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,500

(upbeat music)

489
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,958
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

490
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,083
Don't eat too fast.

491
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,625
(engine revving)

Are you all right?

500
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:32,791
Yes, I'll be right back.

501
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:54,541
(upbeat music)

502
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:59,208

(upbeat music) (upbeat music)

505
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,750
What did you do?

506
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,208
You've seen me the more

507
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,416
beautiful than before.

508
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,625

(coughing)

512
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:40,833
No.

513
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,583
(coughing)

514
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:52,375

(groaning)

(phone ringing)

524
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:35,125
Yes.

525
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:37,291
Yes, hi.

526
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,708
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

527
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,958
I'm 503.

528
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:48,958
Yes.

529
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,666
Yes, hi.

530
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,375
There's been a slight

531
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,583
misuse of the substance.

532
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:03,041
A few extra hours were accidentally used

533
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,458
causing an alteration.

534
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:09,875
So I'm just looking for

535
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,166
the procedure to reverse it.

536
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,000
What has been used on one

537
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,291
side is lost on the other side.

538
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,791
There's no going back.

539
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,750
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

540
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,458
And obviously she was drunk.

541
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,125
Remember there is no she and you.

542
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,333
You are one.

543
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,000
Respect the balance

544
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,083
and you won't have

545
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,375
any more inconveniences.

546
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,333
(phone beeping)

547
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:45,000

548
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:16,500
(dramatic music)

549
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,583
Don't you know

550
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,416
Don't you know

551
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,916
You got to pump it up

552
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,083
Don't you know

553
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,833
Don't you know

554
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,333
You got to pump it up

555
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,291
You got to pump it up

556
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,333
You got to pump it up

557
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,500
You got to pump it up

558
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:53,875
You got to pump it up

559
01:04:53,958 --> 01:05:06,541
(engine revving) (dramatic music)

560
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:13,833
(bell ringing)

561
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:16,500
Sue!

562
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,166
Sue?

563
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,000
I just saw you on TV.

564
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,250
Holy moly.

565
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,708
Makes me want to join your class.

566
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:27,875
Hey, you don't give

567
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,000
private lessons, do you?

568
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:31,208
(laughing)

569
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,541
Hey, what about a

570
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,666
drink at my place tonight?

571
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:39,958
Come on, don't be shy.

572
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,083
I see you standing behind

573
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,625
the door there, gorgeous.

574
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,458
All right, take your

575
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,416
time, but it's a date.

576
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,250
You know, pump it up

577
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,166
You got to pump it up

578
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,166
You know, pump it up

579
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,958
You got to pump it up

580
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:04,750
(engine revving)

581
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:10,125

01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:35,291
(dramatic music)

583
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,041
(gasping)

584
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:37,291
Sue.

585
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:44,958
(dramatic music)

586
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:46,291
(gasping)

587
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:21,333
(dramatic music)

588
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,416
What can I get you?

589
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,083
(dramatic music)

590
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,000
Moka Latte.

591
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,916
It's long, isn't it?

592
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:43,958
Excuse me?

593
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,333
Seven days.

594
01:07:54,666 --> 01:08:17,458
(dramatic music)

595
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:21,375
Did you follow me here?

596
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,541
I was just curious to find out

597
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,458
how things were going for you.

598
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,125
Each time you feel a little

599
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:34,500
more lonely, don't you think?

600
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,875
I don't know what you were talking about.

601
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:40,833
I'm fine.

602
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:43,666
Everything's fine.

603
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,666
It gets harder each time to remember

604
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,458
that you still deserve to exist.

605
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,125
(dramatic music)

606
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:55,916
That this part of

607
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,375
yourself is still worth something

608
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:03,833
that you still matter.

609
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,500
Has she started yet?

610
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,416
Eating away at you?

611
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,125
(dramatic music)

612
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,166
(gasping)

613
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:32,666
Fuck!

614
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:33,916
Watch out!

615
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,416
What?

616
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,041
(dramatic music)

617
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,708
(engine revving)

618
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:55,125
Hey!

619
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,250
Move!

620
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,000
(engine revving)

621
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,833
(dramatic music)

622
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,208
You're still the most beautiful girl

623
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,666
in the whole wide world.

624
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:39,791
(phone ringing)

625
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,083
Hello?

626
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,083
Hi, Fred.

627
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:44,625
It's Lizzie.

628
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:48,541
Hello?

629
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,166
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

630
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:52,583
Oh.

631
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:53,250
Wow.

632
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:54,666
Wow, wow.

633
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,541
I thought I'd never

634
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,666
hear from you again after--

635
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,666
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

636
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:00,791
I just, I've just

637
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,916
been really busy lately.

638
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,083
So listen, I was thinking that

639
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:10,208
maybe we could get

640
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,000
together and grab a drink.

641
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,583
Are you still there?

642
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,458
Sorry, I'm in shock.

643
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,041
I'm in shock again.

644
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:27,500
I could book Luigi's at eight.

645
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,875
Eight in Luigi's?

646
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:30,458
It is.

647
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,083
I will see you tonight.

648
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:35,916
Bye.

649
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,875
Okay, bye.

650
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,791
(sighing)

651
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,333
(sighing)

652
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:48,250
(somber music)

653
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:30,416
(knocking)

654
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,041
(knocking)

655
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:35,416
(somber music)

656
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:54,750
(knocking)

657
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:59,708
(knocking)

658
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:20,666
(somber music) (knocking)

659
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:31,583
(glass shattering)

660
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:35,416
(somber music)

661
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:53,041
(somber music)

662
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,791
(glass shattering)

663
01:13:55,875 --> 01:14:12,791
(knocking)

664
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:18,250
(somber music)

665
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:51,666
(somber music)

666
01:14:51,750 --> 01:15:02,208
(sighing) (ominous music)

667
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:28,791
(ominous music)

668
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,375
(door opening)

669
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:34,375
(ominous music)

670
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:58,250
(ominous music)

671
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:03,041
(grunting)

672
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:08,166
(ominous music)

673
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,833
(phone buzzing)

674
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:20,375
(ominous music)

675
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:25,541
(phone buzzing) (phone buzzing)

676
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:28,625
(phone buzzing)

677
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:31,208
(phone buzzing)

678
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:31,416
(door opening)

679
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,375
(ominous music)

680
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:38,250
(door opening)

681
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,333
Hi everybody.

682
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,041
Hi.

683
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,291
Okay, here we go everyone.

684
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,291
Clear the set please.

685
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,041
First positions, thank you.

686
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:49,916
Roll cameras.

687
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,166
(beeping) And in three, two, one.

688
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:57,750
(electronic music)

689
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,875
Squat, squat, squat.

690
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,416
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

691
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:04,250
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

692
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,500
(upbeat music) Contract, contract, contract,

693
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,208
contract, contract, contract.

694
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:10,500
(upbeat music)

695
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,291
Contract, between your legs.

696
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,041
(upbeat music)

697
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,041
Cut.

698
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:20,791
(beeping)

699
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,916
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

700
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:29,833
I just got distracted.

701
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,166
Not a problem, let's

702
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,000
get right back to it.

703
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,250
Back to one please.

704
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,041
Sorry, it's the control room now.

705
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,541
The director said he saw something

706
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,708
bizarre on the monitor.

707
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,250
Bring up the replay on camera two.

708
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:44,166
Camera two.

709
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:53,666
(ominous music)

710
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:56,125
Forward.

711
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,666
(electronic beeping)

712
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,208
Can I have my dressing gown?

713
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,416
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

714
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,416
But I go and get it.

715
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,583
Let's just take this frame by frame.

716
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:15,833
(electronic beeping)

717
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,625
I need five minutes.

718
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:28,791
(electronic beeping)

719
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,291
(electronic beeping)

720
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:25,958
(electronic beeping)

721
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:27,333
(electronic beeping)

722
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:32,833
(screaming)

723
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:45,166
(panting)

724
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:50,375
(ominous music)

725
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:12,416
(electronic beeping)

726
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:23,791
Yes.

727
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,375
This balance is not working.

728
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,041
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

729
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,000
while she wastes seven days

730
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,625
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

731
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,916
Remember there is no she and you.

732
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:35,583
(electronic beeping)

733
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,166
(screaming)

734
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,166
I love everybody.

735
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:45,708
What's happening?

736
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:46,375
Where is everybody?

737
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:47,875
The TV's been canceled.

738
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,458
What, why?

739
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:50,750
Sue.

740
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:52,875
Harvey wants to see you

741
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:53,583
in his office immediately.

742
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:55,500
Okay.

743
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:57,500
I'll go change him.

744
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,708
No, he said now.

745
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:01,708
(ominous music)

746
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:14,625
(electronic beeping)

747
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:17,833
I'll get right to the bond.

748
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,083
We can't keep you on the morning show.

749
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,375
But why?

750
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:24,791
I just started.

751
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,583
Ratings are through the roof.

752
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,333
We started at 42.

753
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,666
Now we're up to like--

754
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:34,208
216.

755
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,208
It's phenomenal.

756
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:39,916
People love you.

757
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,791
They adore you.

758
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,958
They want more and more and more of you.

759
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,458
That is why we have

760
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,583
decided that we want you

761
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:52,708
to host the New Year's Eve show.

762
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:54,958
You mean the--

763
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,583
The network's biggest show.

764
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,916
50 million viewers live.

765
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,416
You can't go higher than that.

766
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:03,833
(laughing)

767
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:04,583
That's gonna be intense.

768
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:09,833
We only have a few more. So are you in?

769
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:15,250
(ominous music)

770
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:19,708
(door creaking)

771
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:22,000
If you don't open the

772
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,333
door and opportunity knocks,

773
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,250
you won't get another chance.

774
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,708
You of all people know this.

775
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,458
(ominous music)

776
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:37,166
(door creaking)

777
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:41,875
Just one more day and

778
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,000
then I have a whole week off.

779
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:43,708
We can switch.

780
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:55,125
(ominous music)

781
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,375
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

782
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:06,166
Just one more day, okay?

783
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:14,625
(ominous music)

784
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:19,625
(sighing)

785
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:40,583
(ominous music)

786
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,041
(gasping)

787
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:45,083
(screaming)

788
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,500
(ominous music)

789
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,333
(ominous music)

790
01:23:57,416 --> 01:24:17,791
Yes. She didn't respect the balance.

791
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,583
She's stealing more

792
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,916
and more time from me,

793
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,875
completely without

794
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,541
consideration of the consequences.

795
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,541
She's a selfish bitch.

796
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:27,750
Would you like to stop?

797
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:31,250
Stop.

798
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:32,833
You are the Matrix.

799
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,875
If you are not satisfied,

800
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,791
you can put an end to the experience

801
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:37,833
and go back to being

802
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:39,458
just you on your own.

803
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,166
Would you like to stop?

804
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,500
Will it go back to the way it was before?

805
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,458
What has been

806
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,000
transferred won't come back,

807
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,708
but you can stop the experience.

808
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,750
As of now, would you like to stop?

809
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,791
To go back to being just you on your own?

810
01:24:58,916 --> 01:24:59,166
No.

811
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,000
No, no, no.

812
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:04,666
I can't stop.

813
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,333
She just--

814
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,416
I did it.

815
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,208
I did it.

816
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,625
I did it. I did it. (door slams)

817
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,125
The balance just needs to be respected.

818
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,208
So respected.

819
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,375
(phone beeps)

820
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,625
Stop it, stop it, stop

821
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,291
it, stop it, stop it.

822
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:32,333
(ominous music)

823
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,625
You are the Matrix.

824
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:38,041
Well,

825
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,375
congratulations, you've won $25,000.

826
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
We're standing on our final chance

827
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:43,875
and it's your second question

828
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,333
in our big question

829
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,458
round and play for $250,000.

830
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,708
(audience cheers)

831
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:53,458
And you'll have just 45

832
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,041
seconds to come up to get

833
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,458
the correct answer that you can't--

834
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:58,375
(woman gasps)

835
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:10,583
(woman gasps)

836
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,541
(woman groans)

837
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,500
(woman groans)

838
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,250
(woman gasps)

839
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:35,166
(woman groans)

840
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,958
(woman screams)

841
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:55,708
Just a little something to keep you busy.

842
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:08,916
(door slams)

843
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,125
Fuck.

844
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:25,083
Boss.

845
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:35,291
(ominous music)

846
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,833
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

847
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,666
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

848
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:43,333
Are you ready?

849
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,333
Let's welcome her, Sue.

850
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,166
(audience cheers)

851
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,666
You popped up nowhere on

852
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,375
our screens like a tornado.

853
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,500
I don't think anybody was

854
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,166
really prepared for this world.

855
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,666
(audience cheers)

856
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:02,125
(thunder rumbles)

857
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:03,708
(audience cheers)

858
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,000
It all started with the morning show

859
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,708
and rumor has it that you are

860
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,916
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

861
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:13,958
(audience cheers)

862
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,708
Wait, just a moment.

863
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,833
I'm being told that you are going to host

864
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,416
the New Year's Eve show.

865
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,208
Can you confirm this?

866
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:22,958
Yes, that's right.

867
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,500
Yes, that's right.

868
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:25,583
(ominous music)

869
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,000
Oh my God, that is huge news.

870
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,791
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

871
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,666
Where are you from?

872
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,000
How did you get discovered?

873
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:40,541
I want, we want to know everything.

874
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:45,833
(ominous music) Well, I mean, there's

875
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,791
really not very much to tell.

876
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,750
I'm just a girl from a

877
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,166
very small town in Indiana.

878
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,208
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

879
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,500
In fact, it's not even a town.

880
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,750
I'm not sure you could

881
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,166
really even call it a village.

882
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,791
It's a farm, perhaps?

883
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:05,666
(audience laughs)

884
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,958
(ominous music)

885
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,875
But ever since I can remember,

886
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,625
it has always been my

887
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,000
dream to be on screen.

888
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,583
This is my dream.

889
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,583
As a child, I used to

890
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,083
put on shows for my family.

891
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,541
Mm, your family.

892
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,375
How sweet.

893
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,500
(ominous music)

894
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:30,250
So, everyone is aware that

895
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,000
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

896
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,500
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

897
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,125
you turned up the volume,

898
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,208
and you rocked their world.

899
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:42,916
Were you a fan of her show?

900
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:52,791
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

901
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,291
I can't really say that I

902
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,958
actually watched her show.

903
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,041
You do know that we're not exactly from

904
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,083
the same generation.

905
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:03,291
(audience laughs)

906
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,083
And you have to admit, it

907
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,333
was a bit old-fashioned.

908
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:10,833
Jurassic Fitness, really.

909
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,291
(audience laughs) Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.

910
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:16,500
(ominous music)

911
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:18,083
I'll fucking show you.

912
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,166
You really wanna see

913
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,375
some Jurassic Fitness?

914
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:25,541
You want it?

915
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:28,166
Come on, come get your

916
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,000
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

917
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:35,125
(ominous music)

918
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,375
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

919
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,916
So, every morning, rain or shine,

920
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,916
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

921
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,791
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

922
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,000
Whether I liked it or not.

923
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:54,833
(audience laughs)

924
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,458
I guess that's why you could say

925
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,000
we have some sort of connection.

926
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,666
Some sort of connection.

927
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,833
You wouldn't exist without me.

928
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:09,291
(audience applauds)

929
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

930
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,791
It is time, ladies and

931
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:18,250
gentlemen, for our final question.

932
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,833
The question that we ask each

933
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:24,083
and every one of our guests.

934
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:24,458
Okay.

935
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:25,291
(laughs)

936
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,666
Would you share one of your

937
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,958
little beauty secrets with us?

938
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,041
Just one little trick of yours

939
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,125
that helps you look

940
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:36,083
so incredibly stunning.

941
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:36,916
I mean, look at you.

942
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:37,791
I don't know.

943
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,041
Say it!

944
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:40,833
Say it!

945
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,750
Let me think.

946
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:43,583
Say it!

947
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,208
Tell them who your

948
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,791
little beauty secret is!

949
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:48,041
I guess, I would just

950
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,291
show them right here.

951
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:50,958
Here's your little beauty secret.

952
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:52,958
I guess I just try to be myself.

953
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,541
To be sincere and

954
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,541
grateful for all that I have.

955
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,041
And to always remember

956
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,208
to leave with my heart.

957
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,416
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

958
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:02,916
(grunts)

959
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:15,750
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

960
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,583
(laughs)

961
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:18,541
Stop it!

962
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:20,666
Stop it.

963
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:22,708
You're taking it from me.

964
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,750
That's your little secret.

965
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:26,875
Stop it!

966
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,458
(grunts)

967
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,708
(whispers)

968
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,500
You have to control yourself!

969
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:53,833
(growls)

970
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,166
I can't go back, I forgot.

971
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:13,916
Oh, shit.

972
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:18,333
Gross old rat.

973
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:19,875
Stop it!

974
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:50,833
(growls)

975
01:33:50,916 --> 01:34:03,833

976
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:26,541
(dramatic music)

977
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:34,750
Coming to bed?

978
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,125
Yes, I'll be right there.

979
01:34:50,500 --> 01:35:15,291
(dramatic music) (dramatic music)

980
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:48,708
(phone rings)

981
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:51,708
Yes.

982
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,625
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

983
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:56,125
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

984
01:35:58,833 --> 01:35:59,041
Hello?

985
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,291
It's fucking 503.

986
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,166
Yes.

987
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:03,958
Fuck!

988
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,041
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

989
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:07,416
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

990
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,125
It means you've reached the end.

991
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,875
(dramatic music)

992
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:12,833
What do you mean the end?

993
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,375
You've drained it all out.

994
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,375
If you want more, you must

995
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,541
let the fluid regenerate.

996
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,000
Tell me how to do it.

997
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,291
I need to stabilize myself right now.

998
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:23,958
You simply have to switch.

999
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,125
Excuse me?

1000
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,833
The switch reboots the

1001
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,125
fluid secretion process

1002
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,458
so you can continue to

1003
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,416
enjoy the experience.

1004
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,625
No, no, no, no, no.

1005
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,583
I can't switch, I can't.

1006
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,333
Especially not now.

1007
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,000
There is no other option.

1008
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:49,166
(woman screams)

1009
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:55,041

1012
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:08,541
Sue?

1013
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:21,791
Babe?

1014
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:26,041
Sue?

1015
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:27,833
You all right?

1016
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,166
Should I start out tomorrow?

1017
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:41,166
(woman groans)

1018
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:41,666
Babe?

1019
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,875
Babe?

1020
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,166
Sue?

1021
01:37:57,416 --> 01:37:58,125
Is something wrong?

1022
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,875
You look cranky because

1023
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:04,666
you're related business.

1024
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,041
(dramatic music)

1025
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:10,750
Sue, open the door.

1026
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,291
Come on, Sue.

1027
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,708
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

1028
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:18,500
Sue, open the door.

1029
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,208
Open the door, Sue, come on.

1030
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:40,166

1031

(dramatic music)

1032
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:40,458
Come on.

1033
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,541
(woman screams)

1034
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:51,791
Guys!

1035
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,291
What the fuck?

1036
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,250
The fuck out!

1037
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,875
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

1038
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,250
Leave me alone!

1039
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:11,500
What the fuck?

1040
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:59,708
Doorbell

1041
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,500
Yes?

1042
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,208
It's 503.

1043
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,416
I want to stop.

1044
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,708
Are you sure? Once you

1045
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,125
stop, you can't go back.

1046
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,458
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

1047
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:22,958
I want to stop!

1048
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:24,500

Are you sure?

01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:40,500
Once you stop, you can't go back.

1056
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,458
You will simply remain on your own.

1057
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,500
Just on your own.

1058
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,750
Just on your own.

1059
01:42:52,500 --> 01:43:21,625

Okay.

1063

I can't do this.

1064
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:06,166
I need you.

1065
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,583
I need myself.

1066
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:18,791
You gotta get ready. It's our big night.

1067
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,291
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.

1068

Come on.

01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:26,708
Come on.

1070
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:29,833
You're the only lovable part

1071
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,666
of me. You have to come back.

1072
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:34,125
