1
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,940
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Three of a kind, let's do this.
-That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,440
Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets a share.
Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,070
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,530
He thinks he can sit it
out and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,820
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-I know why they call him the Joker.
-So why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,820
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-I heard he wears makeup.
-Makeup?

7
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,950
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,720
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,890
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,010
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,720
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-I said, hands up!
-No!

12
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,350
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,850
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,230
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,730
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,570
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Down! I said, stay down there!
-Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
It's funny. It didn't dial out to 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,910
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-Is it a problem?
-No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,670
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,340
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,430
Obviously we don't want you doing
anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,520
...other than holding
on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,280
On the ground!
Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,110
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,590
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,510
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,390
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-You and your friends are dead.
-He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,730
What...?

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,320
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,580
They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.
What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,790
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,670
Boss told me when the guy was done,
I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,170
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,340
Funny, he told me
something similar.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,960
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,060
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,940
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,990
No, no, no, no, no,
I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,830
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,540
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,540
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,960
That guy's not
getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,380
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,220
What happened to the rest
of the guys?

47
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,360
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,690
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,820
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,070
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,530
Honor...

52
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,410
...respect.

53
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,910
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,370
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,630
I believe whatever doesn't
kill you simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,760
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,630
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,970
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-When are you gonna start?
-Oh, Mike, I believe I already have.

59
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,970
Like this so called Batman. We're hearing that he's
doing some good, that criminals are running scared.

60
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,850
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-No, man. I don't like it tonight.
-What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,110
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,650
That simply is not true. I'm told that our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

63
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,780
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're
closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,070
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,660
The process of cleaning
up the streets is a long one.

66
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,830
I pledged in my campaign,
uh, to have...

67
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,460
...ever intending to see
your wife again, lieutenant?

68
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,290
I thought you had to go look
after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,420
Checked her back
into the hospital.

70
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,510
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,300
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-So he hasn't shown up?
-He often doesn't.

72
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,850
{\a1\pos(115,288)}-I like reminding everybody that he's out there.
-Why wouldn't he come?

73
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,020
Hopefully...

74
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,060
...because he's busy.

75
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,710
That's why we bring dogs.

76
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,210
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-My little princes.
-Please.

77
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,960
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

78
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,880
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

79
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,670
Buyer beware.

80
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,050
I told you my compound
would take you places.

81
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,970
I never said they'd be
places you wanted to go.

82
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,680
My business, repeat customers.

83
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,480
You don't like what I have to offer,
you can buy from someone else.

84
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,400
Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from.

85
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,740
My dogs are hungry.

86
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,750
Pity there's only one of you.

87
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,380
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-What...?
-That's not him.

88
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,510
Loose the dogs!

89
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,780
That's more like it.

90
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,620
Don't let me find
you out here again.

91
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,620
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-We're trying to help you.
-I don't need help.

92
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
Not my diagnosis.

93
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,870
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

94
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

95
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,380
Everybody back now!

96
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,720
He can't resist
showing us his face.

97
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,140
What's he hiding
under that makeup?

98
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,530
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

99
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,330
Him again. Who are the others?

100
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,080
Another bunch of smalltimers.

101
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,160
Some of the marked
bills I gave you.

102
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,620
My detectives have been making
drug buys with them for weeks.

103
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,380
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

104
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,130
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
-Time to move in.

105
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,090
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

106
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,090
What about this Joker guy?

107
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,220
One man or the entire Mob?
He can wait.

108
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,720
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

109
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,440
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Do you trust him?
-Be hard to keep him out.

110
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,060
I hear he's as stubborn
as you are.

111
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,570
Be nice when
Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

112
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,450
You can swap not sleeping
in a penthouse...

113
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,160
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

114
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,080
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

115
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

116
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,830
You ought to be pretty
knowledgeable by now, then.

117
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,590
My armor.

118
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,340
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

119
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,180
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

120
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,850
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Did you get mauled by a tiger?
-It was a dog.

121
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,560
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Huh?
-It was a big dog.

122
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,600
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

123
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,690
Why don't you hire them
and take the weekend off?

124
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,690
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

125
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,700
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
-I know.

126
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,360
But things have improved.

127
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,030
Look at the new
district attorney.

128
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
I am, closely.

129
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,790
Need to know if he can
be trusted.

130
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,000
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

131
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,220
Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.

132
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,260
I trust you don't have me
followed on my day off.

133
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,510
If you ever took one, I might.

134
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,230
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

135
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,520
Batman has no limits.

136
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,730
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Well, you do, sir.
-Well, can't afford to know them.

137
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,400
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

138
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,280
We all know how much you
like to say "I told you so."

139
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,780
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

140
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,410
Probably.

141
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,920
Sorry I'm late, folks.

142
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,050
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Where were you?
-Worried you'd have to step up?

143
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
-Well, then...

144
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,390
...fair's fair.

145
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,600
Heads, I'll take it.
Tails, he's all yours.

146
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,850
Yeah? You wanna flip
a coin to see who leads?

147
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,440
It's my father's lucky coin.
As I recall, it got me my first date with you.

148
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,770
I wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.

149
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,190
I don't.
I make my own luck.

150
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,740
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

151
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,580
I thought the DA just played golf with the mayor,
things like that.

152
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,460
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

153
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,170
With Carmine Falcone
in Arkham...

154
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,340
...someone must have stepped
up to run the so-called family.

155
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,460
Is that man in this
courtroom today?

156
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,640
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Could you identify him for us, please?
-You win, counselor.

157
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,470
It was me.

158
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,980
I have a sworn statement
from you that this man...

159
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,860
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

160
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,150
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

161
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,820
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Order.
-Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

162
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,700
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Granted.
-Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

163
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,670
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

164
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,760
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

165
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,300
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Get him out of here.
-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

166
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,310
We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni,
so we won't be able to charge him.

167
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,270
But the fact they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

168
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

169
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,440
Come on, Harvey.
You're Gotham's DA.

170
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,440
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

171
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,820
But, you know...

172
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,320
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

173
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,410
Can't. I dragged the head
of the Major Crimes Unit down here.

174
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,330
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

175
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,180
I hear you got a hell
of a right cross.

176
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,600
It's a shame
Sal's going to walk.

177
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,810
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

178
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,320
Lightly irradiated bills.

179
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,070
Fancy stuff for a city cop.
Have help?

180
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,240
We liaise with various agencies...

181
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,160
Save it, Gordon.
I wanna meet him.

182
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,910
Official policy is to arrest
the vigilante known as Batman on sight.

183
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,250
Mm-hm. And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

184
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,830
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

185
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,210
...I suggest you take them
up with Maintenance, counselor.

186
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,050
I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

187
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,590
...but the Mob is still
getting its money out.

188
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,220
I think you and your friend have
found the last game in town...

189
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,100
...and you're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

190
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,430
It's bold.

191
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,520
You gonna count me in?

192
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,440
In this town, the fewer people know something,
the safer the operation.

193
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,860
Gordon, I don't like that
you've got your own special unit.

194
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,950
And I don't like that it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

195
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,950
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated
while you were making your name at IA...

196
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,370
...I'd be working alone.

197
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,620
I don't get political points for being an idealist.
I have to do the best I can with what I have.

198
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,960
You want me to back warrants for search
and seizure on five banks...

199
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,960
...without telling me
what we're after.

200
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,630
I can give you the names
of the banks.

201
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Well, that's a start.

202
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,430
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

203
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,440
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

204
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,150
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

205
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,070
I wouldn't know about that.

206
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,990
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

207
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,450
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

208
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,540
Well, Mr. Lau...

209
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,660
...I speak for the rest
of the board...

210
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,170
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

211
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,680
Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished...

212
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,350
...but, frankly,
this is embarrassing.

213
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,100
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

214
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,560
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

215
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,270
It's done.

216
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,190
The numbers are solid.

217
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,900
Do them again.

218
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,150
Wouldn't want the trust fund
to run out, now, would we?

219
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,490
Another long night?

220
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,620
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,540
But I'm not convinced.

222
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,370
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

223
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,960
His revenue stream must
be off the books...

224
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,540
...maybe even illegal.

225
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,380
Okay. Cancel the deal.

226
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,880
You already knew.

227
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,140
Just needed a closer
look at their books.

228
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,350
Anything else you
can trouble me for?

229
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,350
I need a new suit.

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,020
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

231
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,310
I'm not talking fashion,
Mr. Fox, so much as function.

232
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,060
You wanna be able
to turn your head.

233
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,320
Sure make backing
out of the driveway easier.

234
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,320
I'll see what I can do.

235
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,030
Took me three weeks to get
a reservation here.

236
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,330
And I had to tell them I work
for the government.

237
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,160
{\a1\pos(100,288)}-Really?
-The city's health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

238
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,540
Rachel. Fancy that.

239
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,210
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

240
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,710
Rachel, Natascha.
Natascha, Rachel.

241
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,260
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Natascha. Are you the prima...?
-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

242
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,760
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
-Really? So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,270
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,350
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,730
I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,400
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-So, let's put a couple tables together.
-I'm not sure that they'll let us.

247
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,610
Oh, they should.
I own the place.

248
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,030
How could you want to raise
children in a city like this?

249
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,910
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
-Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,580
Is...? Heh-heh.

251
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,290
The Palisades? Sure.

252
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,920
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,050
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,590
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,010
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

256
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,470
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
-Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?

257
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,480
We did. All of us who stood by and let
scum take control of our city.

258
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,400
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

259
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,320
When their enemies
were at the gates...

260
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,190
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

261
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,950
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was considered a public service.

262
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,240
Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the Republic was named Caesar...

263
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,830
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,330
You either die a hero...

265
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,540
...or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

266
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,210
Look, whoever the Batman is,
he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life.

267
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,630
How could he? Batman is looking
for someone to take up his mantle.

268
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,090
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

269
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,010
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,440
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

271
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,860
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

272
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,360
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,370
That's nice of you, Bruce,
but I'm not up for reelection for three years.

274
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,450
No, you don't understand.

275
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,410
One fundraiser with my pals...

276
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,210
...you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,020
The hell is this?

278
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,480
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

279
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,030
A relatively small amount,
68 million.

280
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,740
Who's stupid
enough to steal from us?

281
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,610
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

282
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,740
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.

283
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,290
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,960
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...

285
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,920
...we know that police have indeed identified
our banks using marked bills...

286
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,590
...and are planning to seize
your funds today.

287
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
And since the enthusiastic new DA has put
all my competitors out of business...

288
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,890
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-...I'm your only option.
-So, what are you proposing?

289
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,730
Moving all deposits to one secure location,
not a bank.

290
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,850
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-Where, then?
-No one can know but me.

291
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,360
If the police were to gain
leverage over one of you...

292
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
...everyone's money
would be at stake.

293
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,610
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,860
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

295
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,120
...and the Chinese will not
extradite one of their own.

296
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,910
How soon can you move the money?

297
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,290
I already have.

298
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,290
For obvious reasons,
I couldn't wait for your permission.

299
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,590
Rest assured,
your money is safe.

300
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,770
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

301
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,190
And I thought my jokes were bad.

302
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,440
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

303
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,900
How about a magic trick?

304
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,570
I'm gonna make this
pencil disappear.

305
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,990
Ta-da!

306
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,660
It's...

307
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,120
It's gone.

308
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,830
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

309
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,830
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-You ought to know, you bought it.
-Sit.

310
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,960
I want to hear proposition.

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,180
Let's wind the clocks
back a year.

312
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,180
These cops and lawyers wouldn't
dare cross any of you.

313
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,480
I mean, what happened?

314
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,440
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

315
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,650
You see, a guy like me...

316
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,860
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-A freak.
-Damn right.

317
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,160
A guy like me...
Look, listen.

318
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,000
I know why you choose to have
your little, ahem...

319
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,870
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

320
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,170
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

321
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,050
The Batman.

322
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,470
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

323
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,140
Dent, he's just the beginning.

324
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,480
And as for the television's so-called plan...

325
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,810
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

326
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,570
He'll find him
and make him squeal.

327
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,740
I know the squealers
when I see them...

328
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,570
...and...

329
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,820
What do you propose?

330
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,410
It's simple.
We, uh, kill the Batman.

331
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,710
If it's so simple,
why haven't you done it already?

332
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,580
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

333
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,540
How much you want?

334
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,250
Uh, half.

335
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,220
{\a1\pos(165,288)}-You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.

336
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,510
No, I'm not.

337
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,520
If we don't deal
with this now...

338
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,310
...soon...

339
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,440
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

340
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,570
Enough from the clown!

341
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,700
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

342
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,410
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Shit!
-...this out of proportion.

343
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,080
You think you can steal
from us and just walk away?

344
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,790
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Yeah.
-I'm putting the word out.

345
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,250
Five hundred grand
for this clown dead.

346
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,460
A million alive,
so I can teach him some manners first.

347
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,340
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

348
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,260
...when you wanna start taking
things a little more seriously?

349
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,300
Here's my card.

350
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,390
Mm-mm.

351
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,780
You're a hard man to reach.

352
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,080
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

353
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,210
If you'd asked, I could have taken his passport.
I told you to keep me in the loop.

354
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,040
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

355
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,510
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

356
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,670
My office?

357
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,550
You're sitting down there with scum
like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

358
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,850
Oh, yeah, Gordon. I almost had your
rookie cold on a racketeering beat.

359
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,560
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

360
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,320
We need Lau back.

361
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,450
But the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

362
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,490
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

363
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,870
I'll get him to sing.

364
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,790
We're going
after the Mob's life savings.

365
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,200
Things will get ugly.

366
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,660
I knew the risk when I took
this job, lieutenant.

367
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,370
How will you get
him back, any...?

368
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,380
He does that.

369
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,050
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

370
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,720
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

371
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,060
What's wrong with a phone call?

372
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,850
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

373
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,860
Now, for high-altitude jumps,
you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

374
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,650
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

375
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,400
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

376
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,160
What about getting
back into the plane?

377
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,160
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-I'd recommend a good travel agent.
-Without it landing.

378
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,080
Now, that's more
like it, Mr. Wayne.

379
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,250
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

380
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,760
...for getting their people
out of hot spots called Sky Hook.

381
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,590
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-We could look into that.
-Yeah.

382
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,430
Okay. Now...

383
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,930
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

384
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,940
You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.

385
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,610
Perhaps you should read
the instructions first?

386
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Yeah.
-Now, there is a tradeoff.

387
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,450
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

388
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,580
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

389
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,790
How will it hold
up against dogs?

390
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,080
We talking Rottweilers
or Chihuahuas?

391
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,790
Should do fine against cats.

392
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,090
I found one in Arizona.

393
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,420
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week, and he takes cash.

394
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,430
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-What about the flight crew?
-South Korean smugglers.

395
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,800
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar the whole way.

396
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,720
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Did you think of an alibi?
-Oh, yes.

397
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,120
I believe this
is your plane, sir.

398
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,840
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

399
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,010
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

400
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,980
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

401
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,980
They've brought the body.

402
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,880
So, dead, that's 500.

403
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,630
How about alive? Hm?

404
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,010
You wanna know
how I got these scars?

405
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,930
My father was...

406
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,560
...a drinker...

407
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,980
...and a fiend.

408
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,980
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

409
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Mommy gets the kitchen
knife to defend herself.

410
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,910
He doesn't like that...

411
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,530
...not one bit.

412
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,250
So, me watching...

413
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,000
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

414
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,250
He turns to me and he says:

415
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,090
"Why so serious?"

416
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,930
He comes at me with the knife.

417
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,510
"Why so serious?"

418
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,640
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

419
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,900
"Let's put a smile on that face."

420
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,320
And...

421
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,240
Why so serious?

422
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,780
Now...

423
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,200
...our operation is small but...

424
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,290
...there is a lot of potential...

425
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,000
...for aggressive expansion.

426
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,380
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

427
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,970
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

428
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,800
...tryouts.

429
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,390
Make it fast.

430
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,240
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

431
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

432
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,200
I understand.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,590
For security purposes, I'm gonna have
to ask you to check in your mobile.

434
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,340
Of course.

435
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,810
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

436
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,520
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

437
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,230
{\a1\pos(110,288)}-...I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company.
-Of course.

438
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,570
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

439
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,690
...with you here now,
we can continue.

440
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,620
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

441
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,990
We do not allow cell
phones in here.

442
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,870
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

443
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,670
No, I really came to tell you
that our business deal has to be put on hold.

444
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,300
You see, we can't afford to be
seen to do business with...

445
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,380
...whatever it is you're
accused of being.

446
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm sure a businessman
of your stature will understand.

447
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,220
I think, Mr. Fox,
a simple phone call might have sufficed.

448
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,770
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

449
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,560
Just accidentally wasting it.

450
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,730
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

451
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,860
Hey, sir.

452
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,090
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

453
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,090
How's the view
from LSI Holdings?

454
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,930
Restricted.

455
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,100
Lau is holed up in there
good and tight.

456
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,180
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-What's this?
-I had R & D work it up.

457
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,020
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

458
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,020
records the response time
for mapping an environment.

459
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,110
Sonar. Just like a...

460
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,440
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

461
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,780
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-And the other device?
-It's in place.

462
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,740
Mr. Wayne?

463
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,240
Good luck.

464
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,390
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

465
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,850
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

466
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,150
Oh, you mean, when they find
out that you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

467
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,020
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Are you threatening my client?
-No.

468
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm just assuming your client's cooperation
with this investigation.

469
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,700
As will everyone.

470
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,370
No? Okay.

471
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,830
Enjoy your time
in County, Mr. Lau.

472
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
Wait!

473
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,710
I won't give you the money...

474
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

475
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,380
You were a glorified accountant.

476
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,390
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

477
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,390
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

478
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,140
One big pot.

479
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,850
Got it.

480
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,110
One minute.

481
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,570
RICO. If they pooled their money,
we can charge them all as one criminal conspiracy.

482
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,900
Charge them with what?

483
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,950
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of the conspirators with a felony...

484
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,700
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

485
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,000
Mr. Lau.

486
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?

487
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,790
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-Ledgers...?
-Immunity, protection...

488
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,420
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-...and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
-After you testify in open court.

489
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,930
And I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

490
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,470
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

491
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,770
Like I said,
I'm good with calculation.

492
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,600
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

493
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,310
What is this, Gordon,
your fortress?

494
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,280
Well, you trust them
over at County?

495
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't trust them here.

496
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,530
Lau stays.

497
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,540
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements,
but I'm sure glad he's back.

498
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,160
Put word out. We hire the clown.

499
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

500
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,420
Batman.

501
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,890
{\a1\pos(110,288)}-I'm not aware of any participation by the Batman...
-Our boy looks good on the tube.

502
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,140
You sure you wanna embarrass
me in front of my friends, lieutenant?

503
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,980
Oh, don't worry.
They're coming too.

504
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,650
Have a nice trip.
See you next fall.

505
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,660
712 counts of extortion...

506
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,240
...849 counts of racketeering...

507
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,960
...246 counts of fraud,
87 counts of conspiracy murder...

508
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,000
...527 counts of obstruction of justice.

509
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,800
How do the defendants plead?

510
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,010
Order in the court.

511
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,680
549 criminals at once.

512
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,350
How did you convince
Surrillo to hear this farce?

513
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,650
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

514
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,860
Even if you blow enough smoke to get
convictions out of Surrillo...

515
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,610
...you're gonna set a new record
at appeals for quickest kick in the ass.

516
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,280
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

517
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,870
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

518
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,160
They can't afford to be off the streets long enough for trial and appeal.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

519
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,330
Think of all you could do with
18 months of clean streets.

520
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,000
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Mr. Mayor, you can't...
-No, get out. Both of you.

521
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,720
Sit down.

522
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,680
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

523
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,190
But that means it's on you.

524
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,400
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

525
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,400
Politicians, journalists, cops.

526
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,070
Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.

527
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,910
Are you up to it?
You better be.

528
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,200
Because they get
anything on you...

529
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:45,160
...and those criminals are back on the streets,
followed swiftly by you and me.

530
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,620


531
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,230
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

532
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,070
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

533
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,320
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

534
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,530
...and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly:

535
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,490
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

536
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,740
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

537
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,790
Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.

538
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,580
Sensitive viewers, please be aware.
The image is disturbing.

539
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,960
Tell them your name.

540
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,800
Brian Douglas.

541
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,720
Are you the real Batman?

542
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,930
{\a1\pos(175,288)}-No.
-No?

543
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,050
{\a1\pos(175,288)}-No.
-No?

544
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,930
Then why do you
dress up like him?

545
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,470
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

546
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,770
Because he's a symbol that we don't
have to be afraid of scum like you.

547
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,270
Yeah. You do, Brian.
You really do.

548
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,070
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

549
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,700
So you think Batman's made
Gotham a better place? Hm?

550
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,450
Look at me.

551
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,910
Look at me!

552
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,170
You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.

553
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,630
You want order in Gotham?

554
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,380
Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

555
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,350
Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.

556
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,810
Starting tonight.

557
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm a man of my word.

558
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,540
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

559
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,790
...scared stiff
by the trust-fund brigade.

560
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,210
{\a1\pos(165,288)}-I'll be back.
-Rachel.

561
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,210
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

562
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,800
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Thank you. Alfred, right?
-That's right, sir.

563
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,260
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life?

564
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,680
Not yet, sir.

565
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,220
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

566
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,640
Oh, you have no idea.

567
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.

568
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,420
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

569
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,010
Harvey Dent,
the man of the hour.

570
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,510
Where's Rachel Dawes?

571
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,050
She is my oldest friend.
Come here.

572
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,100
You know, when Rachel first told me that
she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

573
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,730
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

574
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,730
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

575
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
But it caught Rachel's attention.

576
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,070
And then I started to pay
attention to Harvey...

577
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,780
...and all that he's been doing as our new DA.

578
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,740
And you know what?

579
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,290
I believe in Harvey Dent.

580
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,040
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

581
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,880
...a little safer,
a little more optimistic.

582
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,630
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.

583
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,970
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.

584
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,890
Harvey.

585
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,980
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you're making fun of him...

586
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,150
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-...but I do.
-No, I meant every word.

587
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,410
You know that day that you
once told me about when...

588
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,660
...Gotham would no longer need Batman?

589
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,740
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-It's coming.
-Bruce.

590
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:59,170
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-You can't ask me to wait for that.
-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

591
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,800
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

592
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,170
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

593
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,300
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

594
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,600
Thanks again.

595
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,100
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

596
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,860
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

597
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,440
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-Any matches?
-All three.

598
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,110
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

599
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,280
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

600
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,330
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

601
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,540
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

602
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,210
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-City hall.
-Seal the building.

603
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,370
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-No one in or out till I get there.
-Got it.

604
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,060
Gordon. What are you up to?

605
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,480
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

606
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,230
Sorry, sir. We believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.

607
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,810
These are dangerous people, judge.

608
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,860
{\a1\pos(110,288)}-Yeah, but you're not giving me a lot of information.
-Even we don't know where you're going.

609
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,360
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

610
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,120
You cannot leave me alone
with these people.

611
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,330
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

612
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,460
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

613
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,210
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover
this for yourself, so...

614
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,460
...take my word,
the police commissioner earns a lot of threats.

615
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,180
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

616
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,640
Them gunning for you makes
you see things clearly.

617
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,140
Yeah, I bet.

618
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,600
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

619
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,770
...about who you wanna spend
the rest of your life with.

620
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,940
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-That's a pretty big commitment.
-Well, not if the Mob has their way.

621
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,870
You get to explain to my wife...

622
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,370
...why I'm late for dinner, lieutenant.

623
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,710
Sir, the joker card had
traces of your DNA on it.

624
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,920
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Don't do that.
-All right.

625
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,380
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-Let's be serious, then.
-Okay.

626
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,760
What's your answer?

627
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,430
I don't have an answer.

628
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,640
How'd they get my DNA?

629
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,980
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

630
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,770
...must have lifted a tissue or a glass...
Wait! Wait!

631
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,860
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Well, I guess no answer is a no.
-Harvey.

632
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,150
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-It's someone else, isn't it?
-Harvey.

633
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,490
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

634
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,450
What are you doing?

635
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,670
Oh, shit.

636
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,600
Get a medic!

637
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,140
They've come for him.

638
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,810
We made it.

639
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,440
Stay hidden.

640
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,030
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

641
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,870
We are tonight's entertainment.

642
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,040
I only have one question:

643
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,790
Where is Harvey Dent?

644
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,350
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

645
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,810
Hands up, pretty boy.

646
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,730
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him about something.

647
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,730
Just something little, huh? No.

648
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,780
What's going on out there?
Wayne!

649
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,950
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
-Hey, wait...

650
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,330
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

651
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,620
You know,
I'll settle for his loved ones.

652
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,290
We're not intimidated by thugs.

653
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,960
You know...

654
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,590
...you remind me of my father.

655
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,890
I hated my father.

656
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,100
Okay, stop.

657
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,770
Well, hello, beautiful.

658
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,780
You must be Harvey's squeeze.
Hm?

659
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,650
And you are beautiful.

660
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,460
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?

661
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,590
You wanna know how I got them?

662
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,340
Come here. Hey.

663
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,420
Look at me.

664
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,640
So I had a wife.
Beautiful, like you...

665
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,100
...who tells me I worry too much...

666
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,190
...who tells me I ought
to smile more...

667
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:16,860
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

668
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,700
One day they carve her face.

669
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,450
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

670
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,330
I just wanna see her smile again.
Hm?

671
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,580
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

672
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,670
So...

673
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,920
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

674
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,760
...to myself.

675
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,140
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

676
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,850
She leaves.

677
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,980
Now I see the funny side.

678
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,440
Now I'm always smiling.

679
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,190
You got a little fight in you.
I like that.

680
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,690
Then you're gonna love me.

681
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,060
Drop the gun.

682
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,230
Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask
and show us all who you really are. Hm?

683
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,070
Let her go.

684
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,280
Very poor choice of words.

685
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,970
Are you all right?

686
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,600
Let's not do that again.

687
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,400
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Is Harvey okay?
-He's safe.

688
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,270
Thank you.

689
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,610
Jim, it's over.

690
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,440
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

691
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,660
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

692
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,080
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

693
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,290
{\a1\pos(115,288)}-What about Dent?
-He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex...

694
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,040
So where do you keep your trash?

695
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,340
You're due in court.
I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.

696
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,550
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

697
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,050
You refuse to cooperate,
you're not coming back here, you go to County.

698
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,680
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

699
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,600
Targeting me won't get their money back.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down without a fight...

700
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,270
{\a1\pos(110,288)}-...but this is different. They've crossed a line.
-You crossed the line first, sir.

701
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,860
You squeezed them,
you hammered them to the point of desperation.

702
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,030
And in their desperation,
they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.

703
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,070
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

704
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,450
We just need to figure
out what he's after.

705
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,040
With respect, Master Wayne...

706
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,160
...perhaps this is a man you don't
fully understand either.

707
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,670
A long time ago,
I was in Burma...

708
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,260
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

709
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,010
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

710
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,010
...by bribing them
with precious stones...

711
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,770
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

712
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,230
So we went looking
for the stones.

713
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,730
But in six months,
we never met anyone who traded with him.

714
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,360
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

715
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,570
...the size of a tangerine.

716
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,200
The bandit had
been throwing them away.

717
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,580
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-So why steal them?
-Well, because he thought it was good sport.

718
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,710
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

719
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,130
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

720
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,390
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

721
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,990
Your name, sir? Please state...

722
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,330
8th at Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

723
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,680
Check the names.

724
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,980
"Richard Dent."

725
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,270
"Patrick Harvey."

726
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,610
Harvey Dent.

727
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,780
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

728
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,900
{\a1\pos(95,288)}-Us contaminate it? It's because of you these guys are dead...
-Detective!

729
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,160
Give us a minute, guys.

730
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,950
That's brick underneath.

731
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,960
{\a1\pos(115,288)}-Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
-No.

732
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,130
Fingerprints.

733
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,600
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

734
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:43,100
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

735
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,700
I'm not sure you made
it loud enough, sir.

736
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,930
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

737
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,890
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

738
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,850
Well, I found some irregularities.

739
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,350
Their CEO is in police custody.

740
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,440
No, not with their numbers,
with yours.

741
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,570
Applied Sciences. Whole division of
Wayne Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

742
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,990
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

743
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,790
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

744
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,290
Now you got the entire
R & D Department burning through cash...

745
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,800
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

746
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,050
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

747
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,680
I want...

748
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:04,770
...$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

749
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,400
Let me get this straight.

750
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,070
You think that your client...

751
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:18,070
...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

752
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,910
...who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

753
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,250
...and your plan is to blackmail this person?

754
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,010
Good luck.

755
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,300
When...

756
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,180
Keep that.

757
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,310
This is your original scan.

758
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,030
Here it is reengineered.

759
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,790
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

760
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,960
I'll get you a copy.

761
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,960
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

762
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,630
Yeah. Government telecommunications project.

763
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,840
I wasn't aware we had
any government contracts.

764
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,090
Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

765
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,930
Fair enough.

766
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,980
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

767
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,520
...these cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on his threat...

768
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,900
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

769
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,370
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

770
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,660
Cross-reference the addresses.

771
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:49,830
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

772
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,170
I got one.

773
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:56,340
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

774
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:00,800
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

775
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,470
What do you got on the roof?

776
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:45,180
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

777
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:57,770
Commissioner Loeb dedicated
his life to law enforcement...

778
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,230
...and to the protection
of his community.

779
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,190
I remember when I first
took office...

780
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,910
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner...

781
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:10,330
...and he said he would,
provided I kept my politics out of his office.

782
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,250
Clearly he was not a man who minced words,
nor should he have been.

783
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,920
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

784
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,340
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

785
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,390
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Who's that?
-What happened?

786
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,310
They took our guns.

787
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,270
And our uniforms.

788
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,610
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

789
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,740
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

790
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,410
Stand by. Honor guard.

791
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,210
Attention. Port arms.

792
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,800
Ready! Aim! Fire!

793
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,130
Ready! Aim!

794
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,140
Ready! Aim!

795
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,980
Stay down! Don't move!

796
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,480
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

797
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,950
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-I'll see you later.
-Why are you going back?

798
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,630
Get out of here.

799
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,430
Tell me what you know
about the Joker.

800
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,800
No.

801
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,550
I'm sorry, Barbara.

802
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,720
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead.

803
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:37,060
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

804
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,560
Shh.

805
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:41,980
Are you out there?

806
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:47,820
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

807
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,360
You brought this on us!

808
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,990
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

809
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,410
God help whoever he does
wanna talk to.

810
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,000
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

811
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,000
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

812
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,210
What?

813
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,240
{\a1\pos(175,288)}-Yeah?
-Second.

814
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:40,450
Okay.

815
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,790
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Harvey, where are you?
-Where are you?

816
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,790
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

817
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,550
{\a1\pos(115,288)}-Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
-Rachel, listen to me. You're not safe there.

818
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,510
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-This is Gordon's unit.
-Gordon's gone, Rachel.

819
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,260
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-He vouched for these men.
-And he's gone.

820
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,980
The Joker's named you next.

821
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,150
God, is there someone,
is there anyone in this town we can trust?

822
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,020
Bruce.

823
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,480
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

824
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:13,240
{\a1\pos(110,288)}-No. Rachel, come on. I know you're his friend, but...
-Harvey, trust me.

825
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,160
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

826
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,660
Then you go straight there.

827
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,950
Don't tell anybody where you're going
and I'll find you there.

828
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,830
I love you.

829
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,090
I want the Joker.

830
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,970
From one professional to another...

831
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,680
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

832
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,440
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

833
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,190
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-I'm counting on it.
-Huh!

834
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,700
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is. He found us.

835
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,160
He must have friends.

836
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,790
Friends? Have you met this guy?

837
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,540
Someone knows where he is.

838
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,210
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

839
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,710
They're wise to your act.

840
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,880
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

841
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,930
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

842
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,890
But you already
know what that is.

843
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,850
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

844
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:27,560
Or you can let a couple more people get
killed while you make up your mind.

845
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,230
You wanna play games?

846
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:38,570
How's that feel?

847
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,370
{\a1\pos(165,288)}-You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't!

848
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,490
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

849
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,710
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

850
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,290
No. No, I wouldn't.

851
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,050
That's why I'm not gonna
leave it up to me.

852
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,050
Heads, you get
to keep your head.

853
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,090
Tails...

854
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,100
...not so lucky.

855
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:07,020
So you wanna tell
me about the Joker?

856
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,110
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Let's go again.
-I don't know anything! God, don't!

857
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,660
You're not playing
the odds, friend.

858
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,790
Let's do it again.

859
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,460
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

860
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,790
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Not exactly.
-His name's Schiff, Thomas.

861
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,960
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

862
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:42,760
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

863
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,890
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

864
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,850
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

865
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,860
Your stand
against organized crime...

866
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:57,230
...is the first legitimate ray
of light in Gotham in decades.

867
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,030
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

868
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,490
All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released...

869
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,740
...and Jim Gordon will have
died for nothing.

870
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,620
You're gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.

871
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,170
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Why?
-No one else will die because of me.

872
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,670
Gotham's in your hands now.

873
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,540
You can't.

874
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,090
You can't give in.

875
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,920
You can't give in!

876
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,520
Harvey called.

877
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,740
He said Batman's gonna
turn himself in.

878
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,030
I have no choice.

879
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,280
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

880
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,910
Maybe not.
But I have enough blood on my hands.

881
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:54,210
And I've seen now what I would have
to become to stop men like him.

882
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,210
You once told me that if the day
came when I was finished...

883
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,460
...that we'd be together.

884
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,340
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

885
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,220
Did you mean it?

886
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,560
Yes.

887
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,620
Bruce.

888
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,500
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

889
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:48,090
Logs as well? Everything.

890
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,640
Anything that could lead
back to Lucius or Rachel.

891
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,270
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

892
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,190
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

893
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,070
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

894
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:13,790
He can be the outcast.
He can make the choice that no one else can make.

895
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,290
The right choice.

896
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:18,830
No, today I found
out what Batman can't do.

897
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,250
He can't endure this.

898
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,420
Today you get to say
"I told you so."

899
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,180
Today, I don't want to.

900
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,470
But I did bloody tell you.

901
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,520
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

902
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,570
...as your accomplice.

903
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,490
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

904
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,290
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.
I've called this press conference for two reasons.

905
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,500
Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham...

906
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,330
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

907
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,800
Secondly, because the Batman has
offered to turn himself in.

908
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,670
But first, let's consider the situation.

909
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,680
Should we give in to this
terrorist's demands?

910
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,300
Do we really think that he's gonna...?

911
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,850
You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of citizens?

912
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,390
The Batman is an outlaw.

913
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:23,020
But that's not why we demand he turn himself in,
we're doing it because we're scared.

914
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,980
We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

915
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:29,110
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Things are worse than ever!
-Amen.

916
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,370
Yes, they are.

917
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,870
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

918
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,420
And I promise you...

919
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,630
...the dawn is coming.

920
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,340
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

921
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,260
...not to this madman.

922
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,760
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-No more dead cops!
-Yeah!

923
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,640
He should turn himself in!

924
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,520
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Give us the Batman! Come on!
-Where is he?

925
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,570
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.

926
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,990
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-What?
-Is he here?

927
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,740
I am the Batman.

928
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:14,070
What? Come on.

929
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,380
Alfred.

930
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,500
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

931
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:30,670
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-He went down to the press conference.
-I know. And he just stood by.

932
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,930
Perhaps both Bruce
and Mr. Dent...

933
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,100
...believe that Batman stands
for something more important...

934
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,600
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

935
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,770
...even if everyone
hates him for it.

936
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,060
That's the sacrifice
he's making.

937
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,860
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

938
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,030
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

939
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,280
Letting Harvey take the fall
for this is not heroic at all.

940
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,570
You know him better than anyone.

941
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,030
I do.

942
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,460
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

943
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,130
How will I know?

944
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,800
It's not sealed.

945
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,760
Bye, Alfred.

946
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,680
Bye, Rachel.

947
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,440
Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you.

948
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:31,070
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-What are you doing?
-They're transferring me to Central Holding.

949
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,030
This is the Joker's chance,
and when he attacks, Batman will take him down.

950
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,740
Listen to me.
This is too dangerous.

951
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,620
We get this guy to County, he's their problem.
Streets will be cleared along your route...

952
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:44,500
...so let's go.
Convoys stop for no reason.

953
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,120
I hope you got some moves, pal.

954
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:50,460
He's using you as bait. He doesn't even know
if he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

955
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,840
{\a1\pos(100,288)}-How do you know what he's thinking?
-I just...I do. Anyway, Harvey, this isn't just about you.

956
01:13:55,010 --> 01:14:00,010
What about all the people who are depending on you
to clean the city up and to do it honorably and...?

957
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,310
Harvey.
Tell everyone the truth.

958
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,570
Heads, I go through with it.

959
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,690
This is your life.
You can't leave something like that to chance.

960
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,200
I'm not.

961
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,990
You make your own luck.

962
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,810
Hey, you wait
like everybody else, pal.

963
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,780
What the hell is that?

964
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,150
Obstruction ahead,
obstruction ahead!

965
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,530
Damn it! All units divert down onto Lower Fifth.
I repeat, exit down.

966
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,080
Exit down!

967
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,580
Lower Fifth? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.

968
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,610
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

969
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,160
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

970
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,870
We got trouble, guys.

971
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:50,870
Lock and load!

972
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,470
The hell was that?

973
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,990
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-These are built for that, right?
-He's gonna need something...

974
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,950
...a lot bigger to get
through this.

975
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,460
What is that?

976
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,130
What is that, a bazooka?

977
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,470
I didn't sign up for this!

978
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,150
Look out.

979
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,110
Look out!

980
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,460
Hmm.

981
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,510
Come on, let's go!

982
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,310
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

983
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,310
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

984
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,820
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

985
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,420
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

986
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,800
I like this job. I like it.

987
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,680
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

988
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,150
Goodbye.

989
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,460
We're on point, ready to give
them some of their own medicine.

990
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,300
That's what I'm talking about.
Air cav.

991
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,560
Okay, rack them up.

992
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:45,110
Rack them up,
rack them up, rack them up.

993
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,010
That's not good.

994
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,720
Okay, that's not good!

995
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,930
Now, there's a Batman.

996
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,440
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

997
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,490
Come on.

998
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,870
He missed!

999
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,220
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1000
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,320
Come on, come on.

1001
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,830
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1002
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:06,830
Come on.

1003
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,840
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1004
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,630
Come on, hit me.
Come on, hit me!

1005
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,800
Hit me!

1006
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:44,040
Come on, come on. Aah!

1007
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,460
Could you please just
give me a minute?

1008
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,380
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1009
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,590
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1010
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,760
We got him, Harvey.

1011
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,390
Mr. Dent! How does it feel to be
the biggest hero in Gotham?

1012
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,850
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1013
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,190
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1014
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,190
{\a1\pos(115,288)}-No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
-Which was?

1015
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,400
Saving my ass.

1016
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:17,490
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1017
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,570
Thank you, detective.

1018
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,910
I've got a date with a pretty
upset girlfriend.

1019
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,450
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-I figured, counselor.
-Mr. Dent, sir...

1020
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:28,750
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-How about one for the front page, sir?
-Mr. Dent.

1021
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,260
Stand away! All of you!

1022
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,930
I don't want anything for his Mob
lawyer to use, you understand?

1023
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,060
Back from the dead.

1024
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,270
I, uh...

1025
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,360
...couldn't risk
my family's safety.

1026
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:58,490
What do we got?

1027
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,120
Nothing. No matches
on prints, DNA, dental.

1028
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,040
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1029
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,370
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1030
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,460
No name.

1031
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,750
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-No other alias.
-Go home, Gordon.

1032
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,000
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1033
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:19,010
You're gonna need it.

1034
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,840
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1035
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:25,680
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1036
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,660
I'm sorry,
I couldn't risk your safety.

1037
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,580
Look at these ugly bastards.

1038
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,620
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-I don't feel good.
-You're a cop killer.

1039
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:56,130
You're lucky to be feeling
anything below the neck.

1040
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:57,880
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Please!
-Step away from the bars!

1041
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,210
My insides hurt.

1042
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,190
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1043
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,650
Actually, this time...

1044
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,990
...I saved him.

1045
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,960
Has he said anything yet?

1046
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:47,760
Evening, commissioner.

1047
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,600
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1048
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,900
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Of course not.
-What have you done with him?

1049
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,570
Me?

1050
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,320
I was right here.

1051
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,580
Who did you leave him with?

1052
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,580
Hm? Your people?

1053
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,040
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1054
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,920
...and not Maroni's.

1055
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,510
Does it depress you,
commissioner...

1056
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,890
...to know just how alone
you really are?

1057
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:36,770
Does it make you feel responsible for
Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1058
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,610
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Where is he?
-What's the time?

1059
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,610
What difference does that make?

1060
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:47,320
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1061
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,660
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-If we're gonna play games...
-Mm-hm?

1062
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,790
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1063
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,050
Ah, the "good cop,
bad cop" routine?

1064
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,760
Not exactly.

1065
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:22,310
Never start with the head.
The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1066
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,610
See?

1067
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,110
You wanted me. Here I am.

1068
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,280
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1069
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,410
And you didn't disappoint.

1070
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,410
You let five people die.

1071
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,040
Then you let Dent
take your place.

1072
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:45,840
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
-Where's Dent?

1073
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:50,800
Those Mob fools want you gone so they can
get back to the way things were.

1074
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,060
But I know the truth.
There's no going back. You've changed things.

1075
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,640
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Forever.
-Then why do you wanna kill me?

1076
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,020
I don't wanna kill you.

1077
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,070
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1078
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,610
No. No, you...

1079
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,200
You complete me.

1080
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:17,700
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-You're garbage who kills for money.
-Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1081
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:20,290
Even if you'd like to be.

1082
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,380
To them, you're just a freak...

1083
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:25,630
...like me.

1084
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,090
They need you right now...

1085
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,720
...but when they don't...

1086
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,300
...they'll cast you
out like a leper.

1087
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:38,390
You see, their morals,
their code...

1088
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,810
...it's a bad joke.

1089
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:44,400
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1090
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,070
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1091
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,400
When the chips are down, these...

1092
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:54,820
These civilized people...

1093
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:57,080
...they'll eat each other.

1094
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,160
See, I'm not a monster.

1095
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,830
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1096
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,170
Where's Dent?

1097
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,250
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1098
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,760
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-He's in control.
-I have one rule.

1099
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:18,010
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1100
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,350
Which is?

1101
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,930
The only sensible way
to live is without rules.

1102
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,770
And tonight you're gonna
break your one rule.

1103
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,980
I'm considering it.

1104
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,770
There's only minutes left,
so you're gonna have to play my little game...

1105
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,530
...if you wanna save one of them.

1106
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,070
"Them"?

1107
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,280
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1108
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:40,080
The way you threw
yourself after her.

1109
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,460
Look at you go.

1110
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:56,680
Does Harvey know about you
and his little bunny?

1111
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,970
Where are they?!

1112
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,140
Killing is making a choice.

1113
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:04,390
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Where are they?!
-Choose between one life or the other.

1114
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:09,400
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1115
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:18,660
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1116
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,580
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1117
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:26,210
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1118
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,420
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1119
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:33,000
He's at 250 52nd Street...

1120
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:36,510
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1121
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:40,350
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Which one you going after?
-Rachel.

1122
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,180
We're getting Dent!

1123
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,310
250 52nd Street!

1124
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:53,020
Hello?

1125
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,360
Can anybody hear me?

1126
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:01,410
Hello!

1127
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,660
{\a1\pos(175,288)}-Rachel?
-Harvey.

1128
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,040
Oh, Harvey, thank God.
Are you okay?

1129
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:11,790
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1130
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,550
...I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1131
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:17,800
I am too.

1132
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,050
Harvey.

1133
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,770
I want my phone call.

1134
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:32,730
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1135
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,230
That's nice.

1136
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:41,570
How many of your friends
have I killed?

1137
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,410
I'm a 20-year man...

1138
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:50,040
...and I know the difference between punks
who need a little lesson in manners...

1139
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:53,080
and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1140
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,420
And you killed
six of my friends.

1141
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,590
Six?

1142
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,260
Please. My insides hurt.

1143
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:02,180
I don't really care. Back away.

1144
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,510
The boss said he'd make
the voices go away.

1145
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,230
He said he'd go inside and replace
them with bright lights...

1146
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,520
...like Christmas.

1147
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,230
You're out of your mind, pal.
Back off.

1148
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,230
Medic to the holding tank. Come on.
Get the door open.

1149
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,610
You guys, back off!

1150
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,950
Listen, we don't
have a lot of time.

1151
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:24,120
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1152
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,620
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1153
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,460
Okay, Rachel.

1154
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,170
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be
all right. They're coming for you.

1155
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:40,630
Listen to me. I'll help you.
Just talk me through what's going on with you.

1156
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,300
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Can you find something, anything, sharp?
-I'm trying.

1157
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,640
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-What's...?
-Shit.

1158
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,310
Harvey?

1159
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,730
Harvey, what's happening?

1160
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:06,910
All available units,
converge at 250 52nd Street.

1161
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,330
Do you wanna know
why I use a knife?

1162
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,960
Guns are too quick.

1163
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,500
You can't savor all the...

1164
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:22,010
...little emotions.

1165
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:28,810
You see, in their last moments...

1166
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,270
...people show you
who they really are.

1167
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:38,020
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1168
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:45,200
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1169
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,370
What's that? Jeez.

1170
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,620
He's got some kind of a...

1171
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:59,000
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-...contusion.
-I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1172
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,130
I'm gonna have to try
and enjoy it even more.

1173
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:10,640
Whoa!

1174
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,720
Just put it down.

1175
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:15,690
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1176
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,810
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
-Let him go now! Drop it!

1177
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,110
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-What? Sorry?
-What do you want?

1178
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:26,070
I just want my phone call.

1179
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,740
What...? What...?
What's happening?

1180
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:34,750
Just talk to me,
just for one second.

1181
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,750
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-All right?
-Right.

1182
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,090
Ow.

1183
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:45,590
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Ow.
-Shh, shh, shh.

1184
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,600
Is that a phone?

1185
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,610
Mount the curb!

1186
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,620
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1187
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:18,580
Don't think like that, Rachel.
They're coming for you.

1188
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,040
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1189
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:29,550
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1190
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,720
My answer is yes.

1191
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:37,230
No! No! No!

1192
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,020
Not me!
Why are you coming for me?

1193
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,230
No!

1194
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,480
Rachel! Rachel!

1195
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,030
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Harvey.
-No! No! Rachel!

1196
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,240
Okay.

1197
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,490
Rachel!

1198
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,450
No! No!

1199
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,740
Harvey, it's okay.
It's all right. Listen.

1200
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:57,250
Somewh...

1201
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:04,340
No, commissioner!

1202
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,170
Rachel! No!

1203
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,650
Hello there.

1204
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:32,030
Back at the MCU,
the Joker's gone.

1205
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:34,660
With Lau?

1206
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:40,040
The Joker planned to be caught.

1207
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:42,540
He wanted me to lock
him up in the MCU.

1208
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,230
Dear Bruce:

1209
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:08,530
I need to be honest and clear.

1210
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:13,110
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1211
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,200
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1212
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:22,160
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1213
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:24,540
...I meant it.

1214
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:29,550
But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1215
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:32,510
I hope it does.

1216
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,430
And if it does,
I will be there...

1217
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,390
...but as your friend.

1218
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,350
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1219
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,890
I'm sorry to let you down.

1220
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:48,060
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1221
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:53,070
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1222
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,370
Prepared a little breakfast.

1223
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,420
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Very well, then.
-Alfred.

1224
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:10,750
Yes, Master Wayne?

1225
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,380
Did I bring this on her?

1226
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:17,640
I was meant to inspire good...

1227
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,180
...not madness, not death.

1228
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:24,980
You have inspired good.
But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1229
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,230
Didn't you think there
might be some casualties?

1230
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,810
Things were always gonna get worse
before they got better.

1231
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,610
But Rachel, Alfred.

1232
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,570
Rachel believed
in what you stood for...

1233
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,660
...what we stand for.

1234
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:39,280
Gotham needs you.

1235
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,790
No, Gotham needs
its true hero...

1236
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:47,420
...and I let that murdering
psychopath blow him half to hell.

1237
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,920
Which is why, for now...

1238
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,630
...they're gonna have
to make do with you.

1239
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,670
She was gonna wait
for me, Alfred.

1240
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,720
Dent doesn't know.

1241
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,180
He can never know.

1242
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,230
What's that?

1243
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:09,350
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-It can wait.
-That bandit...

1244
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:11,940
...in the forest in Burma.

1245
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:14,150
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-Did you catch him?
-Yes.

1246
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,650
How?

1247
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,700
We burned the forest down.

1248
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,570
He's credible source, an M & A lawyer
from a prestigious consultancy...

1249
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:04,120
...and he says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1250
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,370
And now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1251
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,500
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1252
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:27,560
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1253
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:35,110
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but you won't accept medication.

1254
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:38,110
That you're refusing to...

1255
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,030
...accept skin grafts.

1256
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,610
Remember that name...

1257
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,530
...you all had for me...

1258
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,830
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1259
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,580
What was it, Gordon?

1260
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,630
Harvey, I...

1261
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,290
Say it.

1262
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:59,630
Say it!

1263
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:10,390
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1264
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:16,270
Why should I hide who I am?

1265
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,820
I know you tried to warn me.

1266
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:20,900
I'm sorry.

1267
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:24,160
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1268
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:28,830
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1269
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:32,660
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1270
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,170
Why would you listen to me now?

1271
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,960
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1272
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:42,300
No.

1273
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,880
No, you're not.

1274
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,180
Not yet.

1275
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:55,140
This craziness, it's too much.

1276
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,610
You should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1277
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:00,530
You want him?

1278
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:05,360
I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.

1279
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:15,670
Not so crazy as you look.

1280
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:19,590
I told you,
I'm a man of my word.

1281
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,050
Where is the Italian?

1282
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,340
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1283
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:30,970
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1284
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,720
Please.

1285
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:36,230
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1286
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,560
You see,
I'm a guy of simple taste.

1287
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,400
I enjoy...

1288
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,940
...dynamite...

1289
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,650
...and gunpowder...

1290
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:47,530
...and gasoline.

1291
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:50,040
What the...?

1292
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,910
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1293
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,710
They're cheap.

1294
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,540
I wann know how much they're paying
you to say who Batman really is?

1295
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:04,670
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1296
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,260
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1297
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,760
Let's take the next caller.

1298
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:10,090
Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1299
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,550
You think you know better than him?

1300
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,100
I think that if we could talk to Dent today,
he may feel differently.

1301
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:19,350
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows, we need him now.

1302
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,730
You said you were
a man of your word.

1303
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,070
Oh, I am.

1304
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,450
I'm only burning my half.

1305
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,910
All you care about is money.

1306
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,540
This town deserves a better
class of criminal...

1307
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,960
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1308
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:41,250
Tell your men
they work for me now.

1309
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,790
This is my city.

1310
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:47,010
They won't work for a freak.

1311
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:48,880
"Freak."

1312
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:51,010
Why don't we cut you
up into little pieces...

1313
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:53,140
...and feed you to your pooches?
Hm?

1314
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,999
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1315
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,520
It's not about money...

1316
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:03,900
...it's about sending a message.

1317
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:07,150
Everything burns.

1318
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,820
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Who is this?
-I had a vision...

1319
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,740
...of a world without Batman.

1320
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:17,160
The Mob ground
out a little profit...

1321
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:21,250
...and the police tried to shut
them down one block at a time.

1322
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,710
And it was so boring.

1323
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,840
I've had a change of heart.

1324
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,630
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1325
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:34,510
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1326
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:39,520
If Coleman Reese isn't
dead in 60 minutes...

1327
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,770
...then I blow up a hospital.

1328
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,520
I want you to call in every officer.

1329
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:47,020
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1330
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:51,110
Call the transit authority, school board, prisons.
Get every available bus down to a hospital.

1331
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,870
The priority is Gotham General.
Wheel everybody out of that place right now.

1332
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:57,700
You, you and you,
you come with me.

1333
01:44:57,870 --> 01:44:59,790
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Where are we going, sir?
-To get Reese.

1334
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:03,170
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1335
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,540
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Looking for?
-Hospital admissions.

1336
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:07,380
Will you be wanting the Batpod, sir?

1337
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,510
In the middle of the day, Alfred?
Not very subtle.

1338
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,970
The Lamborghini, then.

1339
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,010
Much more subtle.

1340
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:29,360
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1341
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:33,030
Sir, could you help, please?

1342
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,910
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1343
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,740
Sir? Commissioner,
do you really think...

1344
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:41,080
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1345
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,920
Sir. Commissioner.

1346
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,210
Get the cars around the back!

1347
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:55,930
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1348
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:03,850
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1349
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,940
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1350
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:12,780
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-They're trying to kill me.
-Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1351
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,540
Davis, they got space.
Bring him out.

1352
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,000
Davis.

1353
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,470
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1354
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,850
Nothing on them.

1355
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,470
And a patrolman I don't know.

1356
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,600
Okay, so, what now?

1357
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,730
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1358
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,150
Send the information to Gordon.

1359
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,580
Get out of here.

1360
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,410
Davis.

1361
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:12,000
Ma'am, we're gonna
have to move him now.

1362
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:26,020
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-It's Berg, isn't it?
-Commissioner.

1363
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,600
You okay, son?

1364
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,210
Hi.

1365
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,550
You know...

1366
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,470
...I don't want there to be any hard
feelings between us, Harvey.

1367
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:01,760
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-When you and, uh...
-Rachel!

1368
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:04,220
...Rachel were being abducted...

1369
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:07,390
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1370
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,640
I didn't rig those charges.

1371
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:12,310
Your men, your plan.

1372
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,980
Do I really look
like a guy with a plan?

1373
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,190
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1374
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:21,280
I wouldn't know what to do
with one if I caught it.

1375
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:24,580
You know? I just do things.

1376
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:28,660
The Mob has plans.
The cops have plans.

1377
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:31,040
Gordon's got plans.

1378
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,170
You know, they're schemers.

1379
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,090
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1380
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,760
I'm not a schemer.

1381
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,550
I try to show the schemers...

1382
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:47,010
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1383
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:51,020
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1384
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,060
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1385
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:58,820
...you'll know that I'm
telling the truth.

1386
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,110
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-I'm gonna need your weapon.
-What?

1387
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:09,700
Why? Because
my wife's in the hospital?

1388
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:11,960
Yeah, that'd be why.

1389
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:16,090
It's the schemers that put
you where you are.

1390
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:20,050
You were a schemer,
you had plans...

1391
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,380
...and look where that got you.

1392
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,520
Police are of course taking
every possible precaution...

1393
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:37,820
...urging people not to take
matters into their own hands.

1394
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,530
I just did what I do best.

1395
01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:44,320
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1396
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:49,830
Look what I did to this city with a few drums
of gas and a couple of bullets.

1397
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,290
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1398
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:57,000
Nobody panics when things go
"according to plan."

1399
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:58,840
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1400
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:04,510
If tomorrow I tell the press that,
like, a gangbanger will get shot...

1401
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:08,140
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1402
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:09,510
...nobody panics.

1403
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:13,310
Because it's all part
of the plan.

1404
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:18,400
But when I say that one little old
mayor will die...

1405
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:21,070
...well, then, everyone
loses their minds.

1406
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,410
Introduce a little anarchy...

1407
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,830
...upset the established order...

1408
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:35,540
...and everything becomes chaos.

1409
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:40,130
I'm an agent of chaos.

1410
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,840
Oh, and you know
the thing about chaos?

1411
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,510
It's fair.

1412
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:58,900
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-You live.
-Mm-hm.

1413
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,020
You die.

1414
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:03,230
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1415
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:14,080
Mr. Reese.

1416
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,430
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1417
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,600
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-That was a very brave thing you did.
-Trying to catch the light?

1418
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:40,770
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-You weren't protecting the Van?
-Why? Who's in it?

1419
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,320
Don't you think I should
go to the hospital?

1420
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:50,990
You don't watch a whole lot
of news, do you, Mr. Wayne?

1421
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,970
Southeast.

1422
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,350
It's Gotham General.

1423
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,770
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Did you clear the building?
-Yeah.

1424
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,030
You must know how many were inside.
You have patient lists, roll call.

1425
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,530
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1426
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:15,870
All these other buses were heading off
to other hospitals. My guess is we missed one.

1427
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:18,160
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1428
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:22,790
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1429
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,800
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1430
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,710
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1431
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,880
People are still missing,
including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1432
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:37,300
I'm now being told that we're cutting
to a video GCN has just received.

1433
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:39,390
I'm Mike Engel
for Gotham Tonight.

1434
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:43,230
"What does it take to make
you people wanna join in?"

1435
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:45,980
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1436
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,900
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-...and into the game.
-Bench. Game.

1437
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:52,190
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-Come nightfall, this city is mine.
-Mine.

1438
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,110
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-And anyone left here plays by my rules.
-Rules.

1439
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:58,740
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1440
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:01,040
If you don't wanna
be in the game...

1441
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,580
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-...get out now.
-Get out now.

1442
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,710
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1443
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:09,800
"Ha-ha, ha-ha."

1444
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:45,710
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Gotham P.D. has shut down...
-Sweet Jesus.

1445
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:47,370
...the area's Bridges and tunnels.

1446
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,960
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1447
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:53,090
It's my day off.

1448
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,300
I gotta take a leak.

1449
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,800
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1450
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:05,350
Now what? You need someone
to shake it for you?

1451
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,100
Hello.

1452
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:09,310
Dent.

1453
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,690
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1454
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,530
Half.

1455
01:55:19,570 --> 01:55:21,160
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1456
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:23,330
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-It must've been Maroni's men.
-Shut up!

1457
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:29,120
Are you telling me that you're gonna protect
the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1458
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:30,750
I don't know, he never told me.

1459
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,550
Listen, Dent, I swear to God,
I didn't know what they were gonna do to you.

1460
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:37,260
That's funny...

1461
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:41,760
...because I don't know what's gonna
happen to you either.

1462
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:47,810
Beautiful, isn't it?

1463
01:55:48,190 --> 01:55:49,850
Beautiful.

1464
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,520
Unethical.

1465
01:55:52,690 --> 01:55:54,230
Dangerous.

1466
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,950
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1467
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:00,530
And a high-frequency
generator-receiver.

1468
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:05,790
You took my sonar concept and applied
it to every phone in the city.

1469
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:10,540
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1470
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,840
This is wrong.

1471
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,050
I've gotta find
this man, Lucius.

1472
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:19,340
At what cost?

1473
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:22,300
The database
is null-key encrypted.

1474
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:24,680
It can only be accessed
by one person.

1475
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:28,180
This is too much power
for one person.

1476
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:30,520
That's why I gave it to you.

1477
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:32,190
Only you can use it.

1478
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,150
Spying on 30 million people isn't
part of my job description.

1479
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:42,070
This is an audio sample.
If he talks within range of any phone in the city...

1480
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,450
...you can triangulate
his position.

1481
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,410
I'll help you this one time.

1482
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:49,660
But consider this
my resignation.

1483
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:54,420
As long as this machine is at
Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1484
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:57,090
When you're finished...

1485
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,880
...type in your name.

1486
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:10,560
My officers are going over every inch
of the tunnels and bridges...

1487
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:13,940
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1488
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,940
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-And land routes east?
-Backed up for hours.

1489
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:20,740
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1490
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:23,950
Plus, I wanna use the ferries so I can get
some of those prisoners off the island.

1491
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:27,080
The men you and Dent put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1492
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,370
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1493
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:34,040
...it's a good bet that Harvey's prisoners
might be involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1494
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,710
So where is Harvey?

1495
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,460
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-We haven't found him.
-Oh, Jesus.

1496
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,390
How long can you
keep this quiet?

1497
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:03,150
Don't stop for lights,
cops, nothing.

1498
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:06,160
Going to join your wife?

1499
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:12,160
{\a1\pos(165,288)}-You love her?
-Yes.

1500
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,000
You ever imagine what it would be
like to listen to her die?

1501
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:17,670
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1502
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,090
He killed your woman.
He made you...

1503
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,300
...like this.

1504
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:25,680
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1505
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,470
I want whoever let
him off the leash.

1506
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:32,520
I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other
man inside Gordon's unit?

1507
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,310
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1508
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,650
Look, if I tell you...

1509
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:39,860
...will you let me go?

1510
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:41,940
Can't hurt your chances.

1511
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,360
It was Ramirez.

1512
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:55,040
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-But you said...
-I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1513
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,750
You're a lucky man.

1514
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,970
{\a1\pos(165,288)}-But he's not.
-Who?

1515
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:10,300
Your driver.

1516
01:59:23,570 --> 01:59:24,570
Stand back.

1517
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:27,070
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1518
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,820
You wanna ride across with them?
Be my guest.

1519
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,760
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1520
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:55,930
Right, get on the radio.

1521
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:59,770
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1522
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:02,310
Liberty, this is Spirit.
Come in.

1523
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:05,570
What the heck was that?

1524
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,950
What the...?

1525
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:12,780
Liberty, come in, please.
This is Spirit. Come in.

1526
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:16,290
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1527
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:17,950
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-Liberty, come in.
-Fox.

1528
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,620
There's something going
on on the ferries.

1529
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,670
Get down to the engine room now.

1530
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,500
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1531
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,560
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1532
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:52,740
Oh, my God.

1533
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:54,740
Looks like some kind
of detonator.

1534
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:57,790
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1535
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:04,000
Tonight, you're all gonna be
a part of a social experiment.

1536
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:11,680
Through the magic of diesel
fuel and ammonium nitrate...

1537
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:15,930
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1538
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:18,180
Liberty, come in, over.

1539
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:20,680
It's dead.

1540
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:25,520
If anyone attempts to get
off their boat, you all die.

1541
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:27,150
I'm zeroing in.

1542
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:31,860
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1543
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:34,490
His voice is on the ferry...

1544
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,700
...but it's not the source.

1545
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:40,080
West.

1546
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,630
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Gordon.
-I have the Joker's location.

1547
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,880
Prewitt Building.

1548
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:53,510
Assemble on the building opposite.

1549
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:57,680
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1550
02:01:57,850 --> 02:02:03,020
If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.

1551
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:05,310
So who's it gonna be?

1552
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:08,020
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1553
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:11,530
...or the sweet
innocent civilians?

1554
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:14,240
You choose.

1555
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,320
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1556
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:20,830
...because the people on the other
boat may not be quite so noble.

1557
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,250
Stay back.

1558
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:33,210
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1559
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:37,180
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1560
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:41,600
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-We are not going to talk about this.
-Why aren't we talking about it?

1561
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:44,350
They're talking over the same
exact thing on the other boat.

1562
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,810
{\a1\pos(145,288)}-Let's put it to a vote.
-Yes!

1563
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:54,690
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Hello?
-Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1564
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:57,910
Jim needs you to pack up and put
the kids in the car right away.

1565
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:59,780
But the units outside...

1566
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:01,530
Those cops can't be trusted.

1567
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:04,660
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1568
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:07,790
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1569
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:11,800
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-But where am I supposed to take them?
-250 52nd Street.

1570
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:14,380
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
-Okay.

1571
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,550
She believe you?

1572
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,800
It's because she trusts you...

1573
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,220
...just like Rachel did.

1574
02:03:21,390 --> 02:03:23,470
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-I didn't know...
-You didn't know what they were gonna do?

1575
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,390
You're the second cop
to say that to me.

1576
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,770
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1577
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,190
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1578
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,400
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-Don't!
-I'm sorry.

1579
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:37,400
You live to fight
another day, officer.

1580
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,030
We found the missing hospital bus.

1581
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:44,910
Then we have a hostage situation.

1582
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
It's a shooting gallery.

1583
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,670
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1584
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,670
We have clear shots
on five clowns.

1585
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,590
Snipers take them out, smash
the windows, a team rappels in.

1586
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,510
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1587
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,800
Two, three casualties Max.

1588
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:02,850
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Let's do it.
-It's not that simple.

1589
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:05,350
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-With the Joker, it never is.
-What's simple is...

1590
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,690
...every second we don't take, those people
on the ferries get closer to blowing each other up.

1591
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:11,400
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-That won't happen.
-Then he'll blow both of them up!

1592
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:15,320
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-We don't have time for paper ballots.
-I want everybody to put their votes...

1593
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:17,490
...on this piece of paper.

1594
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:21,360
If anyone's got pens,
pass it along.

1595
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:25,490
Thank you. Anybody else? Coming through.
Anybody else? Thank you.

1596
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:28,540
We need to get these
votes in quickly.

1597
02:04:28,710 --> 02:04:30,250
Come on.

1598
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:34,380
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1599
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,500
We're running out of time!

1600
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:39,630
I need five minutes alone.

1601
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,630
No! There's no time!

1602
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,220
We have clear shots!

1603
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:46,310
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1604
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:48,430
I have to save Dent.

1605
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,730
Get ready.

1606
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,230
Two minutes, then we breach.

1607
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:02,320
Fox, I need picture.

1608
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:07,830
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Hello?
-Jim, we're in trouble.

1609
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:11,370
Okay, you got POV on Alpha...

1610
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,380
...Omni on beta.

1611
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,210
Looks like clowns
and hostages on two floors.

1612
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,800
There's a SWAT team
on the stairwell.

1613
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:27,720
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1614
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:30,480
Line's clear.

1615
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:34,940
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Barbara, calm down.
-He has the kids!

1616
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:38,360
{\a1\pos(170,288)}-Hello, Jim.
-Harvey?

1617
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:42,360
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Where's my family?
-Where my family died.

1618
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:47,120
Blue team, acquire the target.

1619
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:51,370
Entry team, set your charge.

1620
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:10,810
Fox, the SWATs are targeting the wrong
people. The clowns are the hostages.

1621
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,310
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1622
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,480
Entry team, blow and go!

1623
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:23,990
Don't move.

1624
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:26,530
Take the shot.

1625
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:33,830
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1626
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,830
Clowns, put down your guns.

1627
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:38,960
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1628
02:06:39,170 --> 02:06:42,340
Doctors, get down! Clear the line of fire.
Drop your weap...

1629
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:08,110
Freeze!

1630
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:10,000
Stand down or you will be...

1631
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,660
Look up.

1632
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:18,830
See those bad guys
on the floor above?

1633
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
They're waiting to ambush the
SWAT team coming up the elevator.

1634
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:23,500
Sixty seconds.

1635
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:36,390
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1636
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:47,070
So go ahead. Do it.

1637
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:49,240
We're still here.

1638
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:53,370
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1639
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:56,580
Go, go, go!

1640
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:58,540
Blue team, cover!

1641
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:02,540
Uh-oh.

1642
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:05,710
Trouble on the floor above.

1643
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:16,430
Get down on the ground now!

1644
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:27,280
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1645
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,450
We will shoot you.
Drop the officer.

1646
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:33,280
{\a1\pos(135,288)}-Release the officer right now.
-Let him go now! On your knees!

1647
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:35,950
We got him.
He's out of the game.

1648
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:38,620
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1649
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:48,300
Halt!

1650
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,980
Stay down! Don't move!

1651
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:07,440
Be advised. Clowns are hostages,
doctors are targets.

1652
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,910
Ah, you made it.
I'm so thrilled.

1653
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:19,250
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-Where's the detonator?
-Go get him.

1654
02:09:32,630 --> 02:09:35,720
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1655
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:09,000
You don't wanna die...

1656
02:10:09,170 --> 02:10:12,220
...but you don't know
how to take a life.

1657
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:14,050
Give it to me.

1658
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:18,680
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1659
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:24,600
No one wants to get
their hands dirty.

1660
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:27,730
Fine. I'll do it.

1661
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:32,110
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1662
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,570
They chose to murder and steal.

1663
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:37,950
Doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1664
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,880
All the old familiar places.

1665
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,260
Stand by.

1666
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:11,190
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1667
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,480
Give it to me.

1668
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:18,660
You can tell them
I took it by force.

1669
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:24,080
Give it to me, and I'll do what you
should've did 10 minutes ago.

1670
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:49,480
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1671
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,480
There won't be any fireworks.

1672
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:55,110
And here we go.

1673
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:36,360
What were you trying to prove?

1674
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,490
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1675
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:41,660
You're alone.

1676
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:53,750
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1677
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:56,800
That's okay. I came prepared.

1678
02:12:57,010 --> 02:13:01,470
It's a funny world we live in.
Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars?

1679
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,470
No, but I know
how you got these.

1680
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:25,030
Oh, you.

1681
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:28,240
You just couldn't let
me go, could you?

1682
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:33,290
This is what happens when
an unstoppable force...

1683
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:37,920
...meets an immovable object.

1684
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:43,930
You truly are incorruptible,
aren't you?

1685
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:46,800
Huh? You won't kill me...

1686
02:13:46,970 --> 02:13:53,230
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1687
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,610
And I won't kill you...

1688
02:13:56,770 --> 02:14:00,570
...because you're
just too much fun.

1689
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:05,780
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1690
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:07,950
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1691
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:09,950
Maybe we could share one.

1692
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:14,290
You know, they'll be doubling up,
the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1693
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,590
This city just showed you...

1694
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:21,800
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1695
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:25,130
Until their spirit
breaks completely.

1696
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:30,850
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1697
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:33,810
...and all the heroic
things he's done.

1698
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:40,520
You didn't think I'd risk losing
the battle for Gotham's soul...

1699
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:43,610
...in a fistfight with you?

1700
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:45,700
No.

1701
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:49,280
You need an ace in the hole.

1702
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:51,080
Mine's Harvey.

1703
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:53,160
What did you do?

1704
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:56,330
I took Gotham's white knight...

1705
02:14:56,500 --> 02:15:00,130
...and I brought him
down to our level.

1706
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:03,510
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1707
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:06,720
...is like gravity.

1708
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:09,220
All it takes is a little push.

1709
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:27,910
Dent!

1710
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:53,220
This is where they brought her, Gordon,
after your men handed her over.

1711
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:55,560
This is where she died.

1712
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:58,060
I know, I was here...

1713
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:01,860
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-...trying to save her.
-But you didn't.

1714
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:05,570
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-I couldn't.
-Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1715
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:08,360
If you stood up against corruption...

1716
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:10,740
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1717
02:16:10,910 --> 02:16:12,530
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1718
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:17,870
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd lost.

1719
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:22,290
Have you ever had to talk
to the person you loved most...

1720
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:26,340
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1721
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:31,890
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1722
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:36,520
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1723
02:16:38,270 --> 02:16:41,850
{\a1\pos(130,288)}-You're not going to hurt my family.
-No.

1724
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:44,730
Just the person you love most.

1725
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:55,780
So is it your wife?

1726
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:58,540
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1727
02:16:58,910 --> 02:17:00,580
Harvey, put down the gun.

1728
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:04,290
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1729
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:06,960
Oh, goddamn it.

1730
02:17:07,130 --> 02:17:09,300
Will you stop pointing
that gun at my family?

1731
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:11,470
{\a1\pos(160,288)}-No!
-We have a winner.

1732
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,140
No, Jim, stop him!

1733
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:15,470
Harvey. Don't let him...

1734
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,760
Harvey!

1735
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:20,020
I'm sorry!

1736
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:22,900
For everything.

1737
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:27,690
Please don't hurt my son.

1738
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:39,410
You brought your cops?

1739
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:42,460
All they know
is there's a situation.

1740
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:45,630
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1741
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:48,460
You think I wanna
escape from this?

1742
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:51,380
There is no escape from this.

1743
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:53,680
You don't wanna hurt
the boy, Harvey.

1744
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:59,180
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1745
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:04,140
You thought we could be decent
men in an indecent time.

1746
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,020
But you were wrong.

1747
02:18:08,730 --> 02:18:12,530
The world is cruel.
The only morality in a cruel world...

1748
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,200
...is chance.

1749
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,070
Unbiased.

1750
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,530
Unprejudiced.

1751
02:18:19,910 --> 02:18:21,040
Fair.

1752
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,460
His son's got the same
chance she had.

1753
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:25,500
Fifty-fifty.

1754
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:29,130
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1755
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:30,800
We three.

1756
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:34,380
Then why was it me
who is the only one who lost everything?

1757
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:39,510
{\a1\pos(150,288)}-It wasn't.
-The Joker chose me.

1758
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:41,970
Because you were the best of us.

1759
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:47,150
He wanted to prove that even someone
as good as you...

1760
02:18:47,310 --> 02:18:49,060
...could fall.

1761
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:50,690
And he was right.

1762
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:53,110
You're the one pointing
the gun, Harvey.

1763
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:56,320
So point it at the people responsible.

1764
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:59,120
Fair enough.

1765
02:19:02,450 --> 02:19:04,330
You first.

1766
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,510
My turn.

1767
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,440
Harvey, you're right.

1768
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:31,110
Rachel's death was my fault.

1769
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:36,650
Please don't punish the boy.

1770
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:40,950
{\a1\pos(155,288)}-Please, punish me.
-I'm about to.

1771
02:19:42,910 --> 02:19:44,870
Tell your boy he's gonna
be all right, Gordon.

1772
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:46,960
Lie...

1773
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:48,580
...like I lied.

1774
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:53,920
It's going to be all right, son.

1775
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:35,170
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1776
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:53,860
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

1777
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:56,280
Yes, I do.

1778
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:01,860
The Joker won.

1779
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,160
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1780
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:09,460
...undone.

1781
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:14,880
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1782
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,210
We bet it all on him.

1783
02:21:17,550 --> 02:21:20,420
The Joker took the best
of us and tore him down.

1784
02:21:21,010 --> 02:21:22,430
People will lose hope.

1785
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:24,340
They won't.

1786
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:28,720
They must never
know what he did.

1787
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:30,730
Five dead.

1788
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:34,940
{\a1\pos(120,288)}-Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
-No.

1789
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:42,570
But the Joker cannot win.

1790
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:51,040
Gotham needs its true hero.

1791
02:21:57,420 --> 02:22:00,460
{\a1\pos(140,288)}-No.
-You either die a hero...

1792
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:05,090
...or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

1793
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:07,100
I can do those things...

1794
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:10,560
...because I'm not a hero,
not like Dent.

1795
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:16,440
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1796
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,520
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1797
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:21,280
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1798
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:24,070
Call it in.

1799
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:29,120
A hero.

1800
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:32,540
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1801
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,670
Nothing less than a knight...

1802
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:37,920
...shining.

1803
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,170
They'll hunt you.

1804
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:42,130
You'll hunt me.

1805
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:44,590
You'll condemn me.

1806
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:47,590
Set the dogs on me.

1807
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:53,640
Because that's what needs to happen.

1808
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:56,730
Because sometimes...

1809
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:59,060
...truth isn't good enough.

1810
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,230
Sometimes people deserve more.

1811
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,620
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1812
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:29,680
Batman.

1813
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,350
Batman!

1814
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:36,100
Why's he running, Dad?

1815
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,480
Because we have to chase him.

1816
02:23:38,650 --> 02:23:41,520
Okay, we're going in!
Go, go! Move!

1817
02:23:47,610 --> 02:23:49,200
He didn't do anything wrong.

1818
02:23:51,950 --> 02:23:57,540
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1819
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:00,000
So we'll hunt him...

1820
02:24:03,130 --> 02:24:05,210
...because he can take it.

1821
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:10,220
Because he's not a hero.

1822
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:18,980
He's a silent guardian...

1823
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:22,020
...a watchful protector.

1824
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,820
A dark knight.
