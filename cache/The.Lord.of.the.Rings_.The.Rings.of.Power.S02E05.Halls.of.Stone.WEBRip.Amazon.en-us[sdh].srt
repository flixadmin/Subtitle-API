[Dwarves exclaiming]

00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,750
[Narvi] <i>A fire-mountain awoke.</i>

00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,333
<i>The ground-shakes...</i>

<i>our ability to grow crops.</i>

8
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,333
No, no, no.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,250
These Rings will be
beyond any power yet devised

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,458
by Dwarf, or Man.

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,041
They shall be Rings of Power.

12
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,041
<i>Power to heal your mountain.</i>

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,791
[Annatar] Bringing your father
a means of saving his kingdom

14
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,875
<i>might be just the way</i>
<i>to earn back his respect.</i>

15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,666
<i>Perhaps, even your inheritance.</i>

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,625
Did you just insult my father?

17
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,625
You speak ill of the Queen again,
it'll be you suffers an infirmity.

18
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,375
Have I made myself plain?

19
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,333
[man 1] <i>Queen of lies!</i>

20
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,541
[man 2] <i>She's unfit to rule!</i>

21
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,625
[Eärien] His dying words,
the King spoke to me,

22
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,791
and said it was from this...
she took counsel.

23
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,916
This Elf-stone is your queen!

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,208
-Silence!
-The <i>palantír</i> is mine. We need it.

[people chanting] Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

32
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,541
Your High King believes the Dwarves
to be unworthy.

33
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,541
In fact, he has forbidden
the forging of any more Rings at all.

34
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:23,000
We have not the time to bandy words about,
convincing him who is worthy of aid.

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,958
[Annatar] What are you doing?

36
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,375
I am telling him
that I am closing up the forge.

37
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,416
You would lie to your High King?

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,791
I would grant us the space
to complete our work.

39
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,125
This power in Eregion, I don't trust it.

40

<i>You told me once,</i>

41
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,375
<i>the fate of Elves is decided</i>
<i>by wiser minds than our own.</i>

42
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,125
<i>That to try and alter it,</i>
<i>to try and cheat death,</i>

43
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>might lead to an even greater catastrophe.</i>

44
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,708
<i>I keep wondering...</i>

45
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,666
<i>What if you were right?</i>

46
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,250
[Galadriel] <i>A legion of Orcs</i>

47

That trail.

48
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,791
I gather it leads to--

49
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,333
Eregion, my liege.

50
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,666
Word of this must reach the High King
before our host sails for Mordor.

51
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,208
Over there.

[Narvi] This way, sire.

63
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,625
As you can see, we're attempting
to dig a new access-shaft,

64
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,333
to try to reach the sunlight.

65
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:06,958
Uh, but thus far, our every effort
has only made the mountain more unstable.

Something the matter, sire?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No.

70
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,833
No, all is shortly to be well.

71
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,875
[Dwarf 2] Yep.

Dig here.

76
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,916
Sire. That's a foundation wall.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,166
-Take it down--
-Are you explaining Delve-craft to me?

78
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,583
This is where we are meant to dig.
Now do as I say.

79
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,333
Give me your axe.

you'd better stop for some air?

Next time I order you to dig,

you do so.

Right. One, two, three, four.

At last, it is daybreak once more

[Celebrimbor] Dwarves and Elves
working together.

120
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,208
It was said to be impossible.

121
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,666
But our cooperation
has achieved this wonder.

122
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,166
And today, we embark upon a new dream,

123
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,791
to enshrine our friendship in stone.

Narvi's big moment.

128

[Narvi] Behold...

129
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,833
the Doors of Durin.

[all laughing]

131
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,625
The new West-gate of our mountain.

132
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,833
Unbreachable. Visible only by moonlight.

133
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,875
And guarded by a password,
known only to friends.

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,125
Now, take note, smiths,

135
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,750
watch Narvi very closely while he's here.

136
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,083
Not only because he is a masterful artist.

137
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,250
-[Dwarf] Mm...
-[indistinct chatter]

138

-[all laughing]
-[Dwarf] Oh, no...

142
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
To a lasting friendship...

145
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,416
[Narvi] Hospitality's much appreciated.

146
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,083
Too much? My remarks. [chuckles]

147
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,708
I encouraged you to keep it short.

148
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,875
Oh...

149
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,458
Do not recall you saying that.

150
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, you do not always listen.

151
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,541
Once you have an idea set in your head.

152
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,625
Truth is, I should've spoken longer.

153
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,916
To credit your contributions.

154
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,291
[sighs]

155
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,625
Forgive me.

156
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,916
I find it difficult to stay festive,

157
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,125
when those most affected
by Mordor's rise are still suffering.

158
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,750
Rings for Men?

159
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,500
-I did not say anything about Rings.
-[scoffs]

160
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,541
It is a game you play, is it not?

161
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,125
Sowing seeds in others' minds
and then convincing them

162
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,208
that the fruit is of their own thought.

163
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,500
I thought our minds were as one in this.

164
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,375
Have you had a change of heart?

165
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,791
This is a night for Dwarves. Come.
We shall speak of Men tomorrow.

166
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,833
I would prefer to speak of them now.

167
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,541
Much of the misery of Men
is of their own making.

168
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,500
And I have been informed
that it was the Men of the Southlands

169
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,750
who aided Adar in his conquest
in the first place.

170
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,833
Only some of them.

171
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,291
Many of the rest have already
been given new homes,

172
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,541
by their own kind, from Númenor.

173
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,250
Have you ever been to Númenor?

174
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,958
[sighs] No.

175
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,666
It is remarkable.

176
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,958
But fractured.

177
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,500
Ever teetering between glory and ruin.

178
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,208
I fear Númenor.

179
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,000
More than any land in Middle-earth.

180
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,916
I had hoped our Rings
might make her stable.

181
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,583
We cannot give Rings to Men.

182
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,500
The risk of corruption
is simply too great.

183
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,041
Whatever problems we might solve
will be nothing

184
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,750
against those we could create.

185
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,833
Yes.

186
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,875
You are right.

187
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,958
Of course.
Men are capable of great frailty.

188
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,583
But when the darkness falls,

189
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:34,666
there are always some
who rise forth and shine.

190
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,208
Eärendil, Tuor,

191
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,833
Beren, son of Barahir.

192
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,916
Exactly what are you proposing?

193
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,125
We find Men we can trust.

194
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,291
The wisest, the most noble,
the purest of heart.

195
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,750
From Númenor to Rhûn,
we identify nine Ring-bearers

196
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
of the nine greatest mortal kingdoms.

197
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,666
Nine?

198
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,791
The perfection of the Three.

199
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,541
Thrice perfected.

200
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,333
For our third forging, we will make nine.

201
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:28,416
We have accomplished great things,
my friend.

202
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,833
Let us not tempt failure...

203
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,541
by allowing our reach to exceed our grasp.

204
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,041
I am sorry. My answer is no.

205
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,916
The Rings of Power are complete.

206
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,208
Of course.

207
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,541
You need not apologize. Very well.

208
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,500
I shall make the Nine myself.

209
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,875
[Ar-Pharazôn] Have you ever seen it?
Across our western seas.

210
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,791
The white tower of Eressëa...

211
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,041
the very gateway to the Undying Lands.

212
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,375
I have not.

213
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,708
[Ar-Pharazôn] Only the keenest eye can.

214
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,041
And only from the peak of the Meneltarma.

215
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,958
I reckon the Elves
placed it there on purpose.

216
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:48,083
So that every sunset serves as a reminder
that our days must end

217
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,625
and theirs will not.

218
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,500
That no matter how high we climb,

219
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,083
some things will be forever withheld
from our grasp.

220
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,375
The Scepter is now in yours, Father.

221
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
Is that not high enough?

222
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,333
All my life, I believed it was.

223
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,000
The Scepter is what you make it.

224
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,583
The Age of Men is upon us, Father.
Let us take it.

225
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,291
Let us build the Númenor
you have always seen in your mind's eye.

226
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,833
Once, when you were at her breast,

227
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:47,875
your mother prophesied
that you would come to ill ends.

228
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,208
My mother?

229
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,791
What did she say?

230
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,166
Impress me in the task
that I am about to place upon you

231
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,375
and I will tell you.

232
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,875
Fail to do so, and I shall have to find
other places to make use of you.

233
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,500
[Númenóreans chanting]
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

234
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,083
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

235
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,708
[Míriel] Listen to them.

236
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,541
[Elendil] There are other voices
out there.

237
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,625
Valandil tells me that in the Old Quarter,

238
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,875
prayers ascend night and day for you.

239
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,333
For their Queen.

240
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,083
Our Queen.

241
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,625
Command us all
and together we can put this right.

242
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,708
-The Sea-Guard is still loyal to you.
-Elendil--

243
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,958
-Together we can fight.
-Elendil.

244
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:58,250
It was you, who opened my heart again
to the way of The Faithful.

245
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,250
We swore to keep serving.

246
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,583
Now, you wish to be still...

247
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,416
while the wolves are licking the cradle?

248
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,000
What did you see? In the <i>palantír.</i>

249
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,541
[Elendil] <i>I saw myself.</i>

250
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,291
<i>Lost.</i>

251
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,541
<i>Riding from the city to...</i>

252
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
I know not where.

253
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,125
Then you did not see it.

254
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,166
-See what?
-Perhaps it's changed.

255
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,000
What do you mean?

256
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,791
Not every battle must be fought to be won.

257
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,416
Sometimes maintaining stillness of heart
is the greatest victory of all,

258
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,458
the greatest act of faith one can perform.

259
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,958
I don't understand.

260
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,958
For years, that <i>palantír</i>

261
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,541
has shown me only our island's downfall.

262
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,541
But when you touched it,
that vision was gone.

263
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,500
Changed to a new path.

264
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,666
Pharazôn's kingship
is a part of that path.

265
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,958
And so are you.

266
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,458
You have asked for my command.

267
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,708
Now it is given.

268
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,625
[breath trembling]

269
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,000
No matter how hard they push you,
no matter what they try and take,

270
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,250
you must not jeopardize
Númenor's new destiny.

271
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,500
You must remain the calm
at the storm's eye.

272
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,416
Go back to your ship, Captain.

273
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,708
[indistinct shouting]

274
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,375
[Númenórean guard 1]
You render it willingly?

275
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,291
[man] I do.

276
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,458
[Númenórean guard 1] You're no longer
a Sea-Guard. Next.

277
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,583
[Númenórean guard 2] Line up.

278
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,250
[Elendil] Lieutenant.

279
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,416
All right. This way.

280
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,000
What's the meaning of all this?

281
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:11,041
Anyone deemed loyal to the Queen-regent
has been stripped of rank.

282
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,541
On whose authority?

283
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,833
[Eärien] On mine.

284
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,916
I'm sorry. I'd hoped to tell you earlier.

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,250
Lord Belzagar wanted the lot of you
charged with treason.

286
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,291
And yet, overthrowing a queen
has earned you a promotion.

287
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,958
How dare you reduce my grief
to petty ambition?

288
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,083
My brother is dead because Míriel peeped
into an Elf-stone.

289
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,666
You mock that which is sacred.

290
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,083
[Eärien] I mock that which is absurd.

291
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,541
Ar-Pharazôn is your king.

292
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,833
Accept it, Father. I beg you.

293
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,583
You are walking a treacherous path.

294
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,958
And yours is made of seawater.

295
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,666
Take care to keep your feet beneath you,
it's a long way to the bottom.

296
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,750
-[woman] Are you ready?
-[Númenórean guard] Is everything there?

297
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,208
-[man] Yes.
-[Númenórean guard] Next.

298
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,750
It's all there. This is all from the same.
Check him up, now.

299
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,583
Captain leaving deck!

300
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,625
He's nobody's captain now.

301
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,083
[dramatic music playing]

302
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,083
[chuckles softly]

303
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,333
He's right.

304
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,375
I'm not.

305
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,875
Captain.

306
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,583
-Thank you, Captain.
-The Valar protect you.

307
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,500
[Kemen] That's enough.

308
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,541
-[man 1] Thank you, Captain.
-[man 2] Thank you, Captain.

309
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,750
-[man 3] Valar bless you, Captain.
-[man 3] Captain, thank you, sir.

310
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,208
-[man 4] Valar bless you.
-[man 5] Thank you, sir.

311
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,666
[man 6] Thank you, Captain.

312
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,000
That's enough.

313
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,000
-[man 7] Thank you, Captain.
-[man 8] Thank you, Captain.

314
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,083
How do you think this ends? Silence!

315
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,625
-[man 9] Thank you, Captain. Thank you.
-[man 10] Bless you, Captain. Bless you.

316
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,000
-[man 11] Captain, Elendil.
-[man 12] Valar bless you.

317
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,416
[Eärien] Valandil.

318
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,250
Perhaps I can have you taken off the list.

319
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,375
I'll speak to the king.

320
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,750
You would do that for me?

321
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,583
You're one of my oldest friends.

322
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:44,625
I think you've made it clear enough
who your friends are.

323
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,083
[captivating music playing]

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,125
[Celebrimbor] <i>Most noble High King.</i>

325
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,166
<i>I write this letter to convey my deep joy</i>

326
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,833
<i>on hearing of the success</i>
<i>of the Three Rings in Lindon.</i>

327
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:48,125
<i>As requested, the forge is dark</i>
<i>and the workshop is empty.</i>

328
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:54,041
<i>A precious calm has settled over the city,</i>
<i>and I foresee brighter days ahead.</i>

329
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,375
<i>I hope you are able to make a visit soon.</i>

330
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,916
<i>Until then, I remain as ever,</i>

331
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,875
<i>your loyal servant, Lord Celebrimbor.</i>

332
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,916
[Commander of the South]
Our armada is ready to depart.

333
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,041
What are we waiting for?

334
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,208
All is well in Eregion.

335
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,708
The letter proves Galadriel was wrong.

336
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,083
And whilst we hesitate,
Adar's army grows stronger by the day.

337
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,375
If we are to invade, we must leave now.

338
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,125
[sinister music playing]

339
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,250
[high-pitched trilling]

340
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,500
[trilling dies down]

341
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,416
Our enemy is in Mordor.

342
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,291
Are you truly prepared to wager
the future of Middle-earth

343
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,833
on the whispers of that Ring alone?

344
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,625
[dramatic music playing]

345
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,333
-You pushed for this.
-[Disa] I know.

346
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,333
-From the beginning.
-I know. I did. I know.

347
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,166
But learning to hear
the mountain's a gift from Aulë,

348
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,875
one that's honed
and refined over a lifetime.

349
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,833
And this it...

350
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,000
It feels somehow like cheating.

351
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,041
Yeah, he's Durin the Third.

352
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,583
I think he knows a thing or two
about wielding power.

353
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:29,208
That kind of power would test
even the most virtuous of Dwarves.

354
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,291
I pray your father keeps his path true.

355
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,708
Oh! It's perfect.

356
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,625
[Prince Durin IV] Mmm-hmm.

357
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,125
Two hundred for that one.

358
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,083
Two hundred? For a bloody rock?

359
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,166
It's a tuning crystal.

360
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,916
I don't care if it's a cart
and six horses. I won't pay it.

361
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,750
Ah, blame the king's new law.

362
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,875
For every coin spent,
another goes to the crown.

363
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,708
Ring tribute, he calls it.

364
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,375
Ring tribute?

365
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:10,166
Sir, this is for our wee girl's birthday
next week.

366
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,041
Spare a bit for her sake?
We'll give you 100.

367
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,291
-One hundred?
-One hundred.

368
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,375
How's that sound?

369
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,666
Like mine shaft robbery.

370
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,500
[Prince Durin IV groans softly]

371
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,250
[Disa] Mmm!

372
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,291
Hundred and fifty?

373
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,708
[chuckles]

374
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,583
Oh!

375
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,708
-[Dwarf] Careful.
-Aulë's beard, excuse me.

376
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,500
It's rollin'. It's rollin'.

377
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,333
You seem to have kicked it.

378
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,541
Madam, I'm so sorry
to get in your way.

379
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,833
I have it, I have it, I have it.
Oof! No, I don't.

380
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,541
[sighs]

381
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,041
[grunts]

382
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,083
[grunts]

383
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,458
[grunting]

384
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,083
Now then...

385
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,291
Where are you, you little...

386
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:21,916
Oh! [echoing]

387
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,083
What?

388
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,958
What is this? [echoing]

389
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,750
[gasps]

390
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,500
[vocalizing]

391
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,250
[echoing]

392
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,666
[chuckles]

393
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,250
There you are.

394
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,000
[grunting]

395
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,541
Hmm.

396
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:02,375
[creature bellowing]

397
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:06,958
[chuckles softly]

398
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,125
[creature bellowing]

399
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,250
[creature roars]

400
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,708
[screams]

401
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,500
[King Durin]
Emissaries of the seven Dwarven realms,

402
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:32,750
I have gathered you all here today
because Middle-earth is changing.

403
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,333
Its limbs are stretching.

404
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,583
Its bones, creaking.

405
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,500
Some dark will
threatens all our kingdoms.

406
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:53,000
But by Aulë's favor,
my people have passed this test.

407
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,375
And soon, yours shall pass it too.

408
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,333
And rise together
into a new age for our kind

409
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,666
with the help of a power
that will change everything.

410
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,000
[murmuring]

411
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,166
Seven Rings.

412
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,583
Seven lords.

413
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:22,041
And bound within each... power.

414
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,625
Power over earth.

415
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,083
Power over rock.

416
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,208
Power to shape the destinies
of all Dwarves forever.

417
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,166
[Emissary grunts]

418
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,583
The Rings are not for you,
but for your masters.

419
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:43,208
Go back and tell them that each
of your realms may share in this bounty.

420
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,416
But it comes with a price.

421
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,333
[ominous music playing]

422
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,083
[King Durin] <i>Khazad-dûm</i>
<i>shall never want again.</i>

423
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,333
<i>There is gold right beneath us.</i>

424
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,500
We should be delving much deeper.

425
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,208
But who set these restrictions?

426
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, you did, sire. Decades ago.

427
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,041
Then strike them.

428
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,791
Strike... But, sire--

429
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:27,500
Strike them, Delve-master,
or I'll find them...

430
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,666
-Where is it?
-You took it off.

431
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,458
Where is it? What have you done with it?

432
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,375
It's there, sire. You-- You took it off.

433
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,916
You said your hand was feeling heavy.

434
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
[disembodied voices whispering]

435
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:44,958
Oh...

436
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,083
Hmm.

437
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,458
It was. It was.

438
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,083
[sighs]

439
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,291
Start to dig, points
where I've marked.

440
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:10,625
[Narvi] Sire.

441
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,250
Stop!

442
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,541
[breath trembling]

443
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,208
There's something under the mines.

444
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,375
Disa heard it herself.

445
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:29,458
A nameless evil, ancient and powerful.

446
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,500
You mustn't dig.

447
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,916
You have your orders, Delve-master.

448
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,000
Narvi, I beg you.

449
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,958
Delve-master. You have your orders.

450
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,041
[Narvi sighs wearily]

451
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,166
[door opens]

452
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,583
[door closes]

453
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,333
[King Durin] Stone-singers speak
of hearing the mountain.

454
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:08,791
-What?
-With this Ring, I can see it.

455
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:15,333
Every shaft, every ore, every jewel.

456
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,750
In thousands of years,

457
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:23,541
we have barely taken a thimble
from the ocean of her riches.

458
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,208
Disa is mistaken.

459
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,041
There is no danger.

460
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,041
[Celebrimbor breathing heavily]

461
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,541
-[Mirdania] My lord.
-[objects clattering]

462
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,875
[female Elf] Are you hurt?

463
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,375
[indistinct chatter]

464
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:51,833
[male Elf] Are you all right?

465
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,541
[eerie music playing]

466
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,458
[clattering]

467
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,125
Do my eyes deceive me?

468
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,458
No.

469
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,500
We were casting a new design for a Ring.

470
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,833
Mirdania was attempting
to resize it when...

471
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,458
-[clanking]
-[all gasp]

472
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,083
Where is she?

473
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,791
[all exclaiming]

474
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,458
-Look out!
-[female Dwarf] Master!

475
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,541
[disembodied voices whispering]

476
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,541
Get back!

477
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,291
[breath trembling]

478
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,416
[disembodied voices whispering]

479
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,666
[Mirdania gasps]

480
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,750
[Celebrimbor] Stop.

481
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,166
Breathe.

482
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,250
What happened?

483
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,541
I was in a place like this,

484
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:19,666
but shrouded in mist and darkness, and...

485
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,875
I saw-- I--

486
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,083
At first,
I thought it was the forge burning.

487
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,125
But it wasn't.

488
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,708
What was it?

489
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,833
It was tall...

490
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,458
and its skin was made of flames.

491
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:50,083
It came toward me, breathing,
reeking of death,

492
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,083
and I saw... I--

493
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,750
I saw its eyes.

494
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,958
Pitiless and eternal.

495
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,083
I think it's been here.

496
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,666
I think it's been here among us,
all along!

497
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,250
You are with us now.

498
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,333
There is nothing to fear.

499
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,458
Look around.

500
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:16,916
All is well.

501
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:24,208
What did you do differently this time?

502
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:32,375
The Lord of Gifts shared your worry
that Men are too corruptible.

503
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,333
So, we sought to fortify the alloy
by adding more <i>mithril.</i>

504
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,666
No, no!

505
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,916
If you'd wanted to do that,
you should've...

506
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,208
You...

507
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,250
It would save us
immeasurable hours of toil

508
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:55,166
if you would offer
this one, single word of counsel.

509
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,416
-My lord, Celebrimbor.
-You should--

510
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,791
Forgive me, my lord, but Durin the Younger
is arrived from Khazad-dûm.

511
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,083
No, tell him to wait.

512
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,041
He says it is urgent.
Something about the Rings.

513
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,666
I will see what he wants.

514
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,833
No.

515
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,750
No. I will go.

516
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,208
How do you mean "changed"?

517
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:45,083
It's like he's colder. Quicker to anger.

518
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:48,041
Now they tell me,
he refuses to share the other Rings

519
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:52,833
unless the Dwarf-lords promise him
half a share of their mines!

520
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,833
Now, greed is not his way.
It never has been.

521
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,708
I-- [sighs]

522
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,208
Is it possible the Ring he's wearing--

523
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,583
No.

524
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,625
We used the same process, Durin,

525
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,625
the same materials,
even the same tools as for the Three.

526
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:19,416
Now, there simply cannot be a fault
in your Rings.

527
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,000
Then maybe, the fault's in the Ring-maker.

528
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,583
What do you mean?

529
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:31,416
How much do you really know
about this Annatar?

530
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,708
[eerie music playing]

531
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,208
[Annatar] You are very brave.

532
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:54,833
Some who behold the Unseen world
are never quite at home in this one again.

533
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,708
[in Sindarin] Have you seen it?

534
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,250
[in English] Yes.

535
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:05,958
In its light,
things appear as they truly are.

536
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:11,000
Beings of differing shades of light...

537
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,291
And its darkness.

538
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,083
It pains me to say,

539
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,583
for what you saw,
I did not wish for any of you to see

540
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,875
until I had helped him to heal.

541
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:34,875
You... You speak of... Lord Celebrimbor?

542
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,958
Yes.

543
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,166
The toll that creation
has exacted from him

544
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,833
in crafting the Three and the Seven
has left him diminished.

545
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,291
Vulnerable to the shadow.

546
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,125
[in Sindarin] Then, what I saw...

547
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,583
[in English] Promise me you'll speak
to none other of it.

548
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,875
Including him.

549
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,125
I promise.

550
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,791
How strange.

551
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
When the light caught your hair,

552
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,291
for a moment,
you seemed her perfect likeness.

553
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,041
Whose likeness?

554
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,166
Why, Lady Galadriel's, of course.

555
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,583
[High Priest] The souls of those
we have lost yearn for peace.

556
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:49,083
Tonight, we will help them to find it.

557
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:54,166
Until we meet again
in the far green country

558
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,583
under a swift sunrise.

559
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,416
[speaking Quenya]

560
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:01,666
[people repeat in Quenya]

561
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,833
[somber music playing]

562
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:35,875
[speaking Quenya]

563
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,250
[door slams open]

564
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,500
[indistinct chatter]

565
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,000
[in English] This shrine is condemned
by order of the king.

566
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,166
Return to your homes.

567
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,625
My son, this is the oldest shrine
in Númenor.

568
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,375
It's in the way of the new aqueduct.

569
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,416
Leave willingly or leave by force.

570
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,375
The King sends his apologies.

571
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,458
How's it feel to have a daughter
who's ashamed of you?

572
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,083
[Númenórean guard]
You heard him, old man. Out!

573
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,791
[Kemen] Get his arms.

574
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,291
Wait. Wait!

575
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,625
I'll escort him out.

576
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:34,208
[in Sindarin] If she is not stored,
the souls for whom she weeps will be lost.

577
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,041
[in English] Give him the relic.

578
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,750
Give it to him, boy.

579
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,916
I don't know if you're aware,
but I've been promoted to--

580
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,958
[grunts]

581
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:07,833
[coughs]

582
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,541
[laughs]

583
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:17,041
Hold him.

584
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,791
[grunts]

585
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,708
This shrine is for The Faithful.
King's men aren't welcome here.

586
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,458
I don't see you praying.

587
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,916
-May the Valar forgive me.
-For what?

588
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,375
No! No!

589
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,375
[all exclaiming]

590
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,541
[both grunting]

591
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:50,916
[Elendil] Valandil!

592
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,583
[both grunting]

593
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,166
[grunts]

594
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,166
[Elendil] No! Valandil!

595
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,291
[grunting, breathing heavily]

596
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,708
[gasping]

597
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,083
[grunts]

598
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,583
[woman] No!

599
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,541
[grunts]

600
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,250
-[grunts]
-[screams]

601
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:38,416
[screams]

602
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,500
[gasps]

603
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:46,000
No! Valandil, put it down!

604
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,458
Put it down, son.

605
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,041
That's an order.

606
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,500
[whimpers]

607
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,708
Aye, Captain.

608
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,583
[grunts softly]

609
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,583
No.

610
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,666
[dramatic music playing]

611
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,416
[Elendil, muffled] No, no, no, no, no.

612
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,208
No.

613
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,250
[Elendil whimpering]

614
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:37,125
Inform the jailer he was the one
who started the uprising.

615
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,083
[Celebrimbor] No!

616
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:50,125
No, I tell you there is something
wrong with the Dwarven Rings!

617
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:53,666
Or King Durin is misusing his Ring
and seeking to deflect blame.

618
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,750
[Celebrimbor] No!

619
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,041
No, I do not believe that.

620
00:45:57,125 --> 00:46:00,000
As one who so masterfully
manipulates metals,

621
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:03,291
just be mindful someone
is not manipulating you.

622
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,875
You see daggers where there are none.

623
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:09,250
And you ignore them,
until they are right at your throat.

624
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,000
No. Enough.

625
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,500
Did you...

626
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,333
in some way...

627
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,291
alter the Dwarven Rings, yes or no?

628
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:26,625
No.

629
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,041
[Celebrimbor sighs]

630
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:47,958
We did.

631
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,458
What are you talking about?

632
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:57,250
These are matters of spirit,
as much as craft.

633
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:01,458
And this time,
we brought deceit into the process.

634
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:02,875
Deceit?

635
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,458
What deceit could you poss--

636
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,041
The letter.

637
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,625
No.

638
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:19,333
No, that, that was...

639
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:21,541
[Annatar] You lied.

640
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,000
That was not a lie. I--

641
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,333
Your High King consented to the Three.

642
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:34,000
But the Seven we forged
beneath a cloak of deception.

643
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,666
You must go to Lindon forthwith,

644
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,416
and confess the truth to your High King.

645
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,083
Or matters will worsen.

646
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,750
No, do that, he would...

647
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,416
He would never permit me
to forge anything again.

648
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,083
It is either that,

649
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,875
or we plunge straight on...

650
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,291
even deeper into the maelstrom.

651
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,291
[Prince Durin IV] <i>Father,</i>
<i>I have been to Eregion.</i>

652
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:09,416
I tell you, some devilry
has gone into these Rings.

653
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,500
We mustn't use them anymore.

654
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,625
Time and pressure can shape a Dwarf,

655
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:21,375
as surely as it can shape a stone.

656
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:28,083
I had hoped our estrangement
would help shape you, my son.

657
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:32,916
But I did not expect
how much it would shape me.

658
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,666
-Father--
-I am proud of you.

659
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,416
-No.
-I am proud of you.

660
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:43,291
Your desire to partner with the Elves
has saved our kingdom.

661
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:48,375
That is why now, now, more than ever,

662
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,375
I need you.

663
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,458
I need your axe, by my side.

664
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,083
Prince Durin.

665
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,208
[dramatic music playing]

666
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,083
[door opens]

667
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,375
[Disa] Durin?

668
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:33,000
Durin, what did he say? Did he--

669
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,125
I tried.

670
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,708
But-- Durin, no.

671
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,458
I tried to tell him.

672
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,000
Durin...

673
00:49:58,666 --> 00:49:59,666
Swear it.

674
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,458
Swear to me that you
will never wear one of those Rings.

675
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,083
I swear it.

676
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:28,375
[Celebrimbor] <i>There is agency uncanny</i>
<i>in the heart of stone and ore.</i>

677
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:33,291
Even when a work is yet
within the artist's bosom, it begins to...

678
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,333
disobey him.

679
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,500
We have failed. Every one of us.

680
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:47,750
The designs were carried out
to the most exacting detail, my lord.

681
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,125
Were they?

682
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,833
Every last hammer stroke
done to perfection?

683
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:59,250
Or did, did hubris and sloth come together
to dull your attention?

684
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:06,291
We must atone for our mistakes
in the only way we can,

685
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:11,041
by completing the Rings together.

686
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:17,083
The Nine must do far more
than bring aid to Men,

687
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:20,208
they must bring balance
to the entire project.

688
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:24,000
They must draw strength from the Three.

689
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,875
And somehow...

690
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,958
redeem the Seven.

691
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:36,000
They must redeem us all.

692
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,583
We shall work night and day.

693
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:47,625
New designs. New alloys. A new process.

694
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,333
I will be with you at every turn.

695
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:54,750
And any of you who offers so much
as a hair's breadth less

696
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,166
than his utmost effort is a s--

697
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,375
A smith of Eregion no longer.

698
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,000
Have I made myself plain?

699
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,791
[all] Yes, yes, my lord.

700
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,625
It starts now.

701
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,291
[Mirdania, softly]
What has gotten into him?

702
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,250
[hushed chatter]

703
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:21,916
My friends. Do not be discouraged.

704
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:28,166
Your master may seem unreasonable.

705
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:34,208
His demands intemperate,
or even impossible.

706
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,416
But that is simply because he knows
how much depends on your success.

707
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,916
Yet, I know you will not disappoint him.

708
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,458
[breath trembles, sighs]

709
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,250
[Annatar] Or me.

710
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,875
I, for one, am certain

711
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,375
that we will complete the Rings of Power.

712
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,458
[Elven smith 1] Yes.

713
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,958
Shall we begin?

714
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,458
[Elven smith 1]
Yes, of course, my lord.

715
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,791
Lord of Gifts indeed.

716
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:12,541
[indistinct chatter]

717
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,625
[Elven smith 2] Let's get to it.

718
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:31,375
[Orcs snarling and growling]

719
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,458
[sinister music playing]

720
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,083
[Elrond] High King!

721
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:04,583
High King, the Orcs are not in Mordor.

722
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,333
A legion of them are headed for Eregion.

723
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,041
Galadriel was right.

724
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:12,125
You must send the army to Eregion
this moment.

725
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,041
That will not be possible.

726
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:21,250
I have reason to believe
that Sauron is the architect of all this.

727
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:26,250
High King, Eregion is the very jewel
of Elvendom.

728
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,416
If it were to fall, it would be
a mortal blow for all in Middle-earth.

729
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,208
You must send aid!

730
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:36,333
Our armies cannot defeat
both Adar and Sauron.

731
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:37,666
Not alone.

732
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:40,750
[Orcs laughing and snarling]

733
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:44,083
[Orc 1] Come on! Come on!

734
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,291
[sinister music playing]

735
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,208
[Orc, in Black Speech] Back away!

736
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,125
[snarling]

737
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,958
[Orcs laughing]

738
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,416
[Orcs exclaiming]

739
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:27,833
[Orc, in English] Get her out.

740
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,125
[Orcs snarling]

741
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,291
-[Orc 2] Look out for her.
-[Orc 3] It's okay.

742
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,666
[Orcs 4] Yeah.

743
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,708
[grunts]

744
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,250
[Orcs exclaiming]

745
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,125
[Adar, in Sindarin] I brought you here

746
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,208
not as a prisoner...

747
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,083
But as a potential ally.

748
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:58,625
[intense music playing]

749
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,666
For we share a common enemy.

750
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,875
[closing theme music playing]
