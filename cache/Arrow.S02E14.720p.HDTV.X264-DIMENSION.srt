1
00:00:00,921 --> 00:00:03,280
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,894
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,763
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:11,216
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,403
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:19,741
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:24,579
I must be
something else.

8
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,748
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:30,118
Ivo killed Shado.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,586
Because I chose to save you.

11
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:34,539
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,175
Not for long. Because we're going
to take the freighter.

13
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,693
Merlyn is
Thea's father.

14
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,762
But I thought you deserved
to tell Oliver yourself.

15
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:43,581
I'm not going
to tell my son anything.

16
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,852
Thea can never
find out about Merlyn.

17
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,887
As of right now,
we have no relationship.

18
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,878
You and I are done.

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,100
Sweetheart, you ok?

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,770
Every single thing
that's gone wrong

21
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:57,556
in our lives is your fault.
Now get out.

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,925
I'm sorry.
I said, get out!

23
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,204
In six seconds,

24
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,522
lobby security will

25
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,824
undergo a shift change.

26
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:20,379
When that happens,
make for the elevator bay.

27
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:25,217
Copy.

28
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,717
Now, remember
what I told you--

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,174
timing
is everything.

30
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,067
Maintain a pace
of 1.3 meters

31
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,420
per second.
Six seconds to target.

32
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,705
5, 4...

33
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:09,761
Now is the time,
gentlemen.

34
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,102
It's a fingerprint reader.
I can't crack it.

35
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,221
I can.

36
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:29,031
You have 5.3 seconds to get
down the east stairwell.

37
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,733
Stop. Stop!

38
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,452
What the hell are we doing?

39
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,120
We got what we came for.

40
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,206
He said to wait.

41
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,075
Out in the open?
Forget this.

42
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,548
Don't do it.
Don't do it!

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,834
Ahh!

44
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,054
Security clocked us!
Ughh!

45
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,123
SCPD? You've got to send
some officers here.

46
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,594
Up there, third floor.
Third floor!

47
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,429
Ta ta ta ta!

48
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,852
They've alerted
the SCPD.

49
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,072
Exit the east lobby
in 22 seconds.

50
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:17,112
SCPD!
Put your weapons down!

51
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,316
Walczak!

52
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,453
Delta Charlie 52 to search,
I need back-up, downtown!

53
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,142
Power to the people.

54
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:52,625

57
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:08,914
Sara, I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,032
It's ok, I'm fine.

59
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,969
Let me see.
Let me see.

60
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,474
She's bleeding,
but it's not deep.

61
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,594
Good, I can't take
any more scars.

62
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,180
Speaking of...
Mortar round?

63
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,015
Yeah, IED, the Paktika province
in Afghanistan.

64
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,216
Good eye.

65
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:29,751
I know my wounds.

66
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,103
Grenade. Algiers.

67
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,904
I've never
been hit by a grenade.

68
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,406
All those scars, you've never been
hit by a grenade?

69
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,108
Arrow, knife, knife.

70
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,275
A lot of bullets,
no grenades.

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,727
I've got myself
a new bullet.

72
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,362
Nine millimeter,
right there.

73
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,731
.38. I'm mostly swords,
and a spear.

74
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,866
I have a scar.

75
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,785
It's in my mouth.

76
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,787
I had my wisdom teeth
removed when I was 16.

77
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,708
Three stitches.
They were really badly impacted.

78
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,376
You're still cute.

79
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,461
We should get going.
You don't want to be late

80
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,513
for your own
welcome home party.

81
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,133
You didn't have
to throw me a party, Ollie.

82
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,934
Sara, when you come back
from the dead, you get a party.

83
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,469
It's a Queen family tradition.

84
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,138
I don't know how well
that's going to work

85
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,522
with the Lance family
tradition

86
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:08,974
of holding grudges
forever.

87
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,476
She'll come around.
Maybe.

88
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,927
And maybe we should
keep what's going on

89
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,396
between you and me

90
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,698
between us.
For Laurel's sake.

91
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,100
I get that.

92
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,369
I survived Lian Yu
and Nanda Parbat,

93
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,437
I guess I can handle
a cocktail party.

94
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,439
Don't be so sure.

95
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,498
We're never
going to make it.

96
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,753
Ivo has eight guards
on deck at all times, all armed.

97
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,755
The second they see us,
we're dead.

98
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,207
Assuming we can deal
with Ivo's defenses.

99
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,176
How are we going to get
close enough to board the ship?

100
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,727
Maybe we build
a raft.

101
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,629
It'll take us weeks
to find the timber.

102
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,014
We don't have weeks.

103
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,732
I've been on this island
for 264 days.

104
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,351
All I have is weeks.
Shut up.

105
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,736
You don't have
to stick up for me, Ollie.

106
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,938
What? No, both
of you shut up.

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,740
Listen.

108
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,492
Do you hear that?

109
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,582
Hey!
Hey!

110
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,085
Hey!

111
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,120
- Hey, down here!
- Help!

112
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:21,930
You left us sitting in front
of the security camera.

113
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,833
Guards could
have killed us.

114
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,636
Are you listening?

115
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,440
If you had simply waited
for five more seconds, like you were told,

116
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,275
no one would have died.

117
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,945
Sorry. I wasn't going to bet
ten to twenty up in Iron Heights

118
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,814
on your skills
with a stopwatch.

119
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,899
"The strongest of all warriors

120
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,984
are these two--
time and patience."

121
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,519
What?

122
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,988
It's from "War and Peace."

123
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,824
1,440 pages.

124
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,692
It takes a while,
but it's worth a read.

125
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:54,963
Tolstoy knew that patience
was the epitome of strength.

126
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:58,583
It takes fortitude
to stand still.

127
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,836
Just as it is a sign
of weakness or cowardice

128
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,371
to move when you should not!

129
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,039
Look.

130
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,476
We did the job.
You owe me.

131
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,718
The dead are owed nothing.

132
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,242
Ah, come in.
Come in, come in.

133
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,747
Welcome home, Sara.

134
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,271
I'm so happy you're here.
Come on.

135
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,978
Oh, Sara, this is Sin.

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,646
Wait, do you two
know each other?

137
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,070
Uh, no.
We don't.

138
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,363
Right. Uh...

139
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:07,445
I love when people
come back from the dead.

140
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,938
You know.

141
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,488
Juices my zombie fetish.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,607
- Hmm.
- Ahh.

143
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,775
Um, Roy.

144
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,243
Sara.

145
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,878
Come on.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,080
Sorry.

147
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,888
Laurel, it's Ollie.
I hope you're coming to the party.

148
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,591
I heard that you maybe were
a little mad at Sara,

149
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:34,729
and I...she's your sister,
and--and you only get one.

150
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,481
You know?

151
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,732
Bye.

152
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,601
Hey.

153
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,586
Laurel
is not coming.

154
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,154
Well, maybe
she just needs time.

155
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,956
Yeah.

156
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,926
Yeah, I needed
time, too.

157
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,061
When you got back, I...

158
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,197
Well, I was pretty
harsh on you.

159
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,400
Hey, Mr. Lance,
you--you don't have to--

160
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,352
Oh, I do.

161
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,454
When you and Sara
went off on your dad's boat,

162
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,373
you were just a kid,
both of you were.

163
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,927
And whether
she came back, or...

164
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:09,481
I was out of line.

165
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,018
You're not
a killer, Oliver.

166
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,480
Yeah, come on, yeah.

167
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,184
I'm so happy for you, Dinah.

168
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:33,071
Those five years
that Oliver was gone,

169
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,658
was...like a piece of me
was missing.

170
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,293
I know just
what you mean.

171
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,961
Oh, excuse me.

172
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,631
Of course.

173
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:46,200
I didn't think you'd be here.

174
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,670
This is my house.

175
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,840
And if you don't want to pretend
to be mother and son,

176
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,143
then don't throw
parties in my home.

177
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,096
Mom?

178
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,348
Is everything ok
with you and Ollie?

179
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,234
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,323
Hey.

181
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,358
Hey.

182
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,280
You know, I still can't
quite believe it.

183
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,232
I never really
thought Sara

184
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,418
would come back
to us, Quentin.

185
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,574
Yeah, I know.

186
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:33,515
Excuse me. Lance.

187
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:38,186
I'll be right there.

188
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,021
It's work.

189
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,307
There's a homicide
in the Glades, and I--

190
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,259
I better go.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,437
I'm on my way.

192
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,490
How did
you know I was calling?

193
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,742
Because Detective Lance
just got the same call.

194
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,617
What, you guys just
show up to every crime scene now?

195
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,119
I saw you leave.

196
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,341
CSU just pulled this out of a skel
I know named Eddie Walczak.

197
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,510
I've never seen
a knife life this.

198
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,062
It's not a knife,
it's a minute hand.

199
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,732
Like from a clock.

200
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,935
I popped Walczak for b&e
a few years back.

201
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,737
This morning, he and an
accomplice were involved

202
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,538
in a robbery homicide.

203
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,073
What'd they steal?

204
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,358
Some high-tech gizmo.

205
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,578
Kord rep called it
a, um, skeleton key.

206
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,363
What? You know what it is?

207
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,149
It was intended as a military tool
to aid in code breaking

208
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,817
on foreign
intelligence targets.

209
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,736
Felicity Smoak works
at Queen Consolidated

210
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,705
and she said they were working on
something similar...

211
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,407
But Oliver Queen
shut it down once he realized

212
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,260
what it could be used for.
What?

213
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:54,212
It could be modified
to open a bank vault.

214
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,798
Any bank vault.
Ok, listen--

215
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,716
Walczak's small-time
on a good day.

216
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,718
I mean, I doubt he'd even know how
to use this thing,

217
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,605
let alone break into
a place like Kord and steal it on his own.

218
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,607
Walczak was
just the muscle.

219
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,810
We need to find
the brain.

220
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:27,037
Plant your feet.

221
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,174
Strong foundation.

222
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,059
Equals stronger punch.

223
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,098
Nice.

224
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,433
If this is for self defense,
I'd recommend Wing Chun.

225
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:41,051
It uses your opponent's
strength against him.

226
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,904
So it's ideal
for smaller people...

227
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:45,489
Like us.

228
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,075
You seem like you can
take care of yourself just fine.

229
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,494
Are you ok?

230
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:53,531
Where are we
with the skeleton key?

231
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,251
And what...
are you wearing?

232
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:59,620
I just thought I'd...

233
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:02,006
I'm cross referencing
Walczak's known associates

234
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,841
with decryption experts
on the NSA watch list,

235
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,259
but it's taking some time.

236
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:06,544
Which we don't have.

237
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,245
Ok, the key is not
just a code breaker.

238
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,264
In the wrong hands,
it's a weapon.

239
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:11,316
Whoever killed Walczak,

240
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,739
in addition to finding
creepy uses for clock parts,

241
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,086
is very good
at covering his tracks.

242
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,805
Lucky for us.
Uncovering tracks

243
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,857
is what
you're very good at.

244
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,593
Right.

245
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,961
Of course.

246
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,633
Ohh!

247
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:49,470
He's barely alive.

248
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,839
Do you have medical supplies
at the fuselage?

249
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:54,225
We have--we have some.
Just go.

250
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:56,060
I'll be fine.

251
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,849
Hey.

252
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:05,152
I'm really starting
to regret giving you a key.

253
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,656
I'm sorry I bailed
on the party.

254
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,741
Ah, I figured you wouldn't
make an appearance.

255
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:13,777
Finally, someone understands.

256
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,696
Well, I, uh,
I wouldn't go that far.

257
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:18,032
But I understand how
Sara keeping it a secret

258
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,251
that she was
still alive could hurt.

259
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:21,869
'Cause it hurt me, too.

260
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:24,655
I sense a "but"
coming in my future.

261
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,791
But, yes, but I need you
to move past it.

262
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:30,845
Laurel.

263
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,329
A family dinner.

264
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,399
It's a chance to reconcile.

265
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,468
I don't want
to reconcile with Sara.

266
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,587
I'm not talking
about you and Sara.

267
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,972
I'm talking about...

268
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:43,507
me and your mom.

269
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,260
What do you mean?

270
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,611
I don't know to
describe it.

271
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:51,115
It was like there
was, um...signals.

272
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:53,868
And feelings.

273
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,786
And I'm not exactly sure
what's going on,

274
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:57,538
but I figured if we were all
together as a family,

275
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,624
maybe it would remind her of
how happy we were.

276
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,626
You know?

277
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,345
I mean, I don't
know, maybe it...

278
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:05,996
Is it stupid?

279
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,865
No, it--

280
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,835
Go for Delta-Charlie 52.

281
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,254
415 in progress.

282
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:15,339
Widmeer Bank. Lieutenant
requesting all units.

283
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,558
Delta-Charlie 52
responding.

284
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,043
I got to go.

285
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:24,047
Tonight.

286
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,182
8:30.

287
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:28,102
Tell everyone to be here.
What?

288
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,571
Well, your place
is too small,

289
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:33,107
and, no offense,
it's kind of a mess, so...

290
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:36,160
Oh, sweetheart.
Ok.

291
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,828
I love you, sweetheart.

292
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,997
Ok.

293
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:45,402
Device is hot.
3.2 seconds.

294
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,709
Extract as much money
as you can in 90 seconds.

295
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,384
Stop! Get out of there!

296
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,552
We've still got 20 seconds.

297
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:03,554
No, you don't.

298
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,439
Come on!

299
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,194
They're
already gone!

300
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,095
I think
I have an idea where.

301
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,897
The skeleton key operates
on an OFDM wireless signal.

302
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,232
I'm picking up
a transmission signal

303
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,600
in the alley next
to the bank.

304
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,953
But you won't be
heading there.

305
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,537
What was that?

306
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,823
He's hacked our
transmission.

307
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:26,243
My associates may be
headed to the alley,

308
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:28,829
but the 9:10 bus
from Crescent Circle

309
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:32,549
is about to collide with
the Starlight Freight Express.

310
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:38,472
Oh, my God, he's right, the 9:10's
headed for the track at Amherst.

311
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:41,592
By my calculations,
you can't be in two places at once.

312
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,794
He doesn't know
there's two of us.

313
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:56,106
Come on!
Come on!

314
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,768
He's in the transit
department network!

315
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,870
He's--he's hacked
the signaling system.

316
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:12,706
I--I can't get
the crossing barriers down!

317
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,324
Those
buses have radios.

318
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,826
Can you break in,
wave them off?

319
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,128
No, he's keeping me out.

320
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:58,650
I guess it's not real until
the media comes up with a nickname.

321
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:00,869
How can I run a bar
without any bartenders?

322
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,504
For that matter,
how can you quit

323
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:03,956
without giving me notice?

324
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,660
No, one hour before opening
is not notice, Mandy.

325
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,663
Can I talk to you
for a second?

326
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:15,667
I'm going to go use
the little blonde's room.

327
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,522
Everything ok?

328
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:21,940
You tell me.

329
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,142
Other than the party,

330
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,526
I haven't seen you
at home all week.

331
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,195
I've been busy.

332
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:28,647
Being a CEO doesn't leave me
a lot of free time.

333
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,600
Yeah, looks to me a whole lot like
you're avoiding mom.

334
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,452
I'm not avoiding mom.

335
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,871
You're lucky your life
does not revolve around lying.

336
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:37,323
Thea.

337
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,708
Everything's fine.

338
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,795
You know, it's secrets that pushed
this family apart in the first place, Ollie.

339
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:44,997
Speedy, speedy. Really.

340
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,000
Everything's fine.

341
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,594
What do we know?

342
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,179
He hacked
into our frequency,

343
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,014
somehow gained
remote access,

344
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,400
but I upgraded
our firewall.

345
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,935
Now he won't be able to talk into
our comms even if he had a bazooka.

346
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,904
You know...
computer science-wise.

347
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,773
Good.

348
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,359
I think I have something
that might help us track him down.

349
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,327
I can run that
to the lab.

350
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,562
I spent a year on the freighter
studying genetic blood anomalies.

351
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,199
I kind of know my way
around a microscope.

352
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,285
There's some significant
cell damage

353
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,004
and the platelet count
is extremely low.

354
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:28,073
Felicity, can I use
your computer?

355
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,380
Macgregor's Syndrome.
It's a genetic defect

356
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,515
that creates fluid
build-up in the lungs,

357
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:40,686
which leads to oxygen deprivation
and multi system organ failure.

358
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,221
It's terminal.

359
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,089
But the syndrome may
give us a way to ID him.

360
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,846
People with Macgregor's
are extremely rare,

361
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,396
and people with Macgregor's
and a degree in computer

362
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,800
science are even more rare.

363
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:52,364
William Tockman.
Former encryption engineer at,

364
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,566
wait for it--
Kord Enterprises.

365
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,168
What's the point? He'll be dead before
he can spend all the money.

366
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,323
He's not stealing
the money for himself.

367
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,209
He's using it for his
family. His sister, specifically.

368
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,778
She's got cystic fibrosis and needs
a lung transplant.

369
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,797
Give me an address, please.

370
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,916
52 Nelson Way.

371
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,563
This area doesn't look
very residential.

372
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:26,064
There.

373
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,300
That's
Tockman's ride.

374
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:55,210
Tockman's not here.
Just some device.

375
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,379
I'm on it.
Whatever's in the truck

376
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,331
is transmitting the same OFDM signal
Tockman used at the bank.

377
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,884
Can you trace it?
As we speak.

378
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:06,285
It's leading...
back to our network.

379
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,984
Tockman's piggybacking
off my hack. It's a trap.

380
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,344
He--he's trying
to break into our network.

381
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:14,846
I'm not trying.

382
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,698
I am.

383
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:21,019
Where are you?

384
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,755
Are you home?

385
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,025
Are you safe?

386
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:29,294
Somewhere you think
you're safe...

387
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:32,548
Somewhere without windows
for anyone to creep through?

388
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,167
Underground, perhaps?

389
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,471
You think no one
can get to you?

390
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:42,307
You think no one
can touch you

391
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,210
in the safety
of your hidey hole?

392
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:46,878
Felicity...

393
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,014
But I can.

394
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,725
How bad?

395
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:07,159
Tockman used
the skeleton key

396
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,661
to penetrate
our firewall.

397
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,629
And recode
our security.

398
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,065
Basically, he told our system
to commit suicide.

399
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,134
And it did.

400
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,702
Bravo, clock king.

401
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,037
Sara stopped Tockman's men
before they could

402
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,805
get away with the cash.

403
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:23,609
So Tockman is going
to be looking for another score.

404
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:27,379
Maybe we should
give him one.

405
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:30,249
Would you call Walter
and have him liquidate

406
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,184
500,000 shares of QC stock?

407
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,954
Put it in cash in my vault
at Starling National,

408
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,922
and ask him
to do it tonight.

409
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:40,059
If Tockman wants
to make another score...

410
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,729
Who better to rob than
a suddenly cash flush Oliver Queen?

411
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,364
And what if he doesn't
take the bait?

412
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,200
That's a good point.
Make it 800,000 shares.

413
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,902
Ok.
What can I do?

414
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,203
Go to your dinner.

415
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,072
Your family's probably
waiting for you.

416
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,007
Right.

417
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,676
Dinner at Laurel's.

418
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,711
This is more important.

419
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,314
You can't do
anything here, Sara.

420
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:04,650
Your family's
important, too.

421
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,685
Yeah.
Hey.

422
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,588
You should go.

423
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,025
Will you go with me?

424
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,793
What?

425
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,162
I know I've wanted us
all to get together for a while now.

426
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,431
It's just, now that it's
actually here, I'm nervous.

427
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,968
I mean, last time I saw Laurel,
it...didn't go very well,

428
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,736
and...

429
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,239
It'd be helpful to not
have to go alone.

430
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,409
I should probably
stay here.

431
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,844
What is it exactly you think
you can do here to help?

432
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,848
Call if you need us.

433
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,017
Yep.

434
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,655
You know, it's not
your fault, Felicity.

435
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,790
Really?
Which one of the rest of you

436
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,293
put up the security
safeguards?

437
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,694
Maybe if it been Sara,

438
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,765
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

439
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,300
Now, I know we haven't
talked about this,

440
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,302
but it must be difficult
for you seeing them together.

441
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:59,337
This isn't about them
being together.

442
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,841
This is about me.
Ok, Sara can analyze blood.

443
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:06,611
She can kick ass.
She can do anything.

444
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,880
And the one thing
I'm supposed to be good at,

445
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,849
I'm failing at
miserably.

446
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,819
And why do you even
need me now that you have her?

447
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,655
Because you're irreplaceable,
Felicity.

448
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,331
I have a lot
of work to do.

449
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:40,678
Laurel,
Sara's here.

450
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,254
Oh.

451
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,455
Hey, Mom.

452
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,724
Hi.

453
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,860
Oliver.
Well, thank you,

454
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,361
these are lovely.

455
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,597
Thank you.

456
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,966
Hey.

457
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,168
I don't remember
your last name being Lance.

458
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,904
Well, yeah, I certainly didn't want
to crash your family dinner,

459
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,373
but then...Sara and I
ran into each other,

460
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,908
and she mentioned it.

461
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,343
And I told him how dad

462
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,445
was making his famous
chicken cacciatore.

463
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,614
Actually--excuse me!

464
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,083
We're, uh, we're--Oliver.

465
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,885
Hey, Mr. Lance.

466
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,056
Yeah. Um, we're having
pizza. I'm sorry.

467
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,892
I had a little incident
in the kitchen.

468
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,159
I guess that's what
happens when you haven't

469
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,061
used an oven in six years.

470
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,430
Want to grab a slice?

471
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,599
Yeah, when I was
pitching a tower of caccitore--

472
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,267
a cacciatore tower, yeah.

473
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,870
Are you still teaching,
Mrs. Lance?

474
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,039
Yes, I am. Greek
and Medieval History

475
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,608
at Central City University.
Wow.

476
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,610
You could probably
give them notice.

477
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,378
Why would I do that?

478
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,414
Well, I mean, you're going to come
back to Starling, right?

479
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,282
No.

480
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,985
I'm not moving back
to starling, Quentin.

481
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,420
Well, Sara's back.

482
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,722
I have a new life
in Central City,

483
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,325
and, um, I have
a wonderful job.

484
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,193
Well, there's
jobs here.

485
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,999
More than a job.

486
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,501
Um...I have...

487
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,271
Someone.

488
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,040
Oh.

489
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,742
Congratulations.

490
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,944
You know,
it's great, Mom.

491
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,480
You deserve
to be happy.

492
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,016
- Everybody does.
- Yeah.

493
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,389
Ohh.

494
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:36,393
You've got to be
kidding me.

495
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,528
What?

496
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,898
You've been back
like, what, a week?

497
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,636
And you're not
even denying it.

498
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,506
It's...It's
complicated.

499
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:53,076
Of course
it is. It's you.

500
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,544
Laurel, please.

501
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,945
Dad, you are no better
than they are.

502
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,981
I mean, what did you think,
mom was just going

503
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,349
to sit around and wait
for you for six years

504
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,650
to bake her chicken?
Ok, Laurel, enough!

505
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,652
And sweep her
back off her feet?

506
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,787
Enough, ok?
Yeah, you know what, it is enough!

507
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,857
Invite yourselves out
when you're done.

508
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,499
My wallet.

509
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,668
Ok.

510
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,512
She's my daughter.

511
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,881
She's 12.

512
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,450
I need to talk to her.

513
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,385
Your radio's broken.

514
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:42,325
Her mother died.

515
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,360
Just after she
got out of diapers.

516
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,629
Cancer.

517
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,397
And without me...

518
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,067
She's not going to have anybody
to look after her.

519
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,069
So...

520
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:59,408
I know I don't know you.

521
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,211
And I know
you don't know me.

522
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,514
But...

523
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:08,984
Please make sure
my daughter's ok.

524
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:11,086
Please.

525
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,763
Hey!

526
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,431
You are
unbelievable!

527
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,100
You lecture me on how
I need to repair

528
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:26,869
my relationship
with Sara

529
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,804
when you're the one
who messed it up in the first place.

530
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,472
By screwing her!

531
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,441
And now you're
doing it again.

532
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:35,044
You're right.
This is all my fault.

533
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,945
Yeah. Yeah,
yes, it is.

534
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,148
And is you losing your job,

535
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,583
doing drugs
and being a drunk,

536
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:43,252
is that my fault?

537
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,920
Is that your family's fault,

538
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,156
or are you going
to blame Tommy for dying?

539
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,557
Screw you,
Oliver.

540
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,193
I have stood by you
through everything--

541
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:53,128
the DUI, losing your job,

542
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,963
and Laurel, I was concerned
about your well-being

543
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:57,766
when you were trying to get
my mother the death penalty!

544
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,102
Yeah, you've been a real
stand-up kind of guy.

545
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,738
Laurel, do you think you're the only one
that is having a hard time?!

546
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,007
Do you think you're the only one
with family issues?

547
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,110
You have--
you have no idea

548
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,712
what is going on
with my family right now.

549
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:17,419
But I am still standing here.

550
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:21,890
And you are still blaming
everybody but yourself.

551
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:24,459
Are you done?

552
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:30,365
Yeah.

553
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:34,069
Yeah, I'm done.

554
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:38,073
I'm done taking the blame.

555
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:41,543
And I'm done caring.

556
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:46,247
Why don't you go have a drink?

557
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,318
Get wasted, go...

558
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
Go to Verdant.

559
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:55,990
I'll pay for it.

560
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:03,698
I have loved you
for half my life.

561
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,204
But I'm done
running after you.

562
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:28,434
Have you seen Felicity?

563
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:30,626
No. Wait, why?

564
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:32,693
I went to Big Belly to get some take-out.
When I came back, she was gone.

565
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:34,695
I haven't seen her for hours.

566
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,001
Hey.

567
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:42,204
Tockman took the bait.
The money you had Walter deposit.

568
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:44,705
I'm reading his signal
at Starling National.

569
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,875
Wait...How do you
know that?

570
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:51,479
Because I'm here.
What?!

571
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:14,402
Aahh!

572
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:16,571
Ahem.

573
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:19,541
What are you doing here?
I'm tracking Tockman.

574
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,609
He fried our computers,
so I'm using the bank's

575
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,111
to trace the skeleton key's
signature.

576
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,545
And the jacket?

577
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:26,814
I was cold.
Hmm.

578
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:28,850
Diggle, get her out of here.

579
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:32,920
Tockman disabled
the bank's security system.

580
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:35,423
I re-abled it.

581
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,460
They're blocking
our way out.

582
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:42,296
I'll deal with them.

583
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,399
Tockman's
signal's strong.

584
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:47,034
He's here, he's close.
Find him, Felicity.

585
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,903
No need.

586
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:50,872
I'll tell you
exactly where I am.

587
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,808
I'm everywhere.
At the moment, I'm particularly focused

588
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,476
on the sub-level.

589
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:58,379
The gas mains,
specifically.

590
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:03,284
Oh, my God. He shut down
the gas main release.

591
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:04,785
And why is that bad?

592
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:06,153
The build-up could
cause an explosion.

593
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:07,888
It will. It'll blow up
three square blocks.

594
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,457
No, it won't.

595
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:42,122
Wait. Tockman
overplayed his hand.

596
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:44,525
The gas main's in the city's network,
that's where I live.

597
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,293
Am I supposed
to understand that?

598
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:49,463
Ohh. In trying
to blow us up,

599
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:51,064
he gave me a way
to track him down.

600
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,100
That I understood.

601
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:17,924
What's happening?

602
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:32,138
Look out!

603
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,544
You don't even know
why I'm doing this.

604
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,715
The money's
not for me!

605
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,416
I'm doing this
all for her!

606
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:45,385
Doesn't make it right.

607
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:48,388
Tempus fugit.
Time flies.

608
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,961
What the hell was that?

609
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,896
His cell phone.

610
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,298
I uploaded
the same virus

611
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,901
he used on my gear
in the foundry.

612
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,470
I didn't just
kill him, did I?

613
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:06,172
Just knocked him out.

614
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:13,680
We did it.
You did it.

615
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:25,847
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the hospital?

616
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:29,150
Mm-mm. You guys never
go to the hospital.

617
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:33,788
Besides, Dig gave me
some of those aspirins.

618
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,223
Are you spinning?

619
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:38,059
Aspirin?
Oxycodone.

620
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,361
I wouldn't be here

621
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:43,765
if you hadn't been
so brave. Thank you.

622
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,733
It was nothing.

623
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:48,202
I've always wanted to say
I've taken a bullet for someone,

624
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:49,871
and now I can.

625
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:52,273
So really I should
be thanking you.

626
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,442
All done.

627
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:56,010
Ohh.

628
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,579
Not bad, but you're still
going to have a scar.

629
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,048
My own scar.

630
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,483
Yay.

631
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:09,290
You all right?

632
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,092
Diggle had mentioned
that maybe you were

633
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,961
feeling...a little left out.

634
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:16,998
What? No.

635
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,636
I was just...

636
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:23,838
use to being
your girl.

637
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,008
I mean, not
your girl-girl.

638
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,778
Your girl.

639
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,314
I know it sounds
like the same word,

640
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:37,451
but it means something
different in my head.

641
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,386
Mmm.

642
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,455
Hey.
Hmm?

643
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:43,457
You will always
be my girl, Felicity.

644
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,334
Can I have another
one of those aspirins?

645
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:00,674
Hi.

646
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:03,010
Try this.

647
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,718
Good, huh?

648
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,954
It's really good.

649
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,189
Mm-hmm.

650
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:16,990
And what
are you doing

651
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,726
back here
mixing drinks?

652
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:22,029
Thea hired me.

653
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:24,965
I am the new bartender.

654
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,833
Uh-huh.

655
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,236
I bartended in college,
and, uh, well,

656
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:31,471
it's kind of hard to get a job

657
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:34,708
when international assassin
is the highlight of your résumé.

658
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,743
You're going
to do great.

659
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,850
I have to go home.

660
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,018
Is everything ok?

661
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,887
I hope so.

662
00:36:57,064 --> 00:37:00,000
You can go.

663
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:03,169
I'm not here
to kill her or anything.

664
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:16,182
I remember you used
to bartend

665
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:20,019
at that skeevy bar
with the...

666
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:23,923
peanut shells
all over the floor.

667
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,592
Yeah, Oblivion.

668
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:27,827
Right.

669
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,698
I'm not here
for a drink or anything.

670
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,401
Then why
are you here?

671
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,838
Because I realized that...

672
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,242
that I went on that boat
with you, too.

673
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,311
And...

674
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,314
I've been slowly

675
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,451
drowning for all of these years.

676
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:58,224
And after every heartbreak

677
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:01,127
or set-back

678
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:04,030
or loss...

679
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,266
I sank deeper
into the dark water.

680
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:12,672
And so when I saw you,

681
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:15,007
so beautiful,

682
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,643
and so alive,

683
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:21,414
I realized that
I'm not those things.

684
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,316
Not anymore.

685
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:32,458
So please...

686
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,194
Please don't hate me, Sara.

687
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,031
Please.

688
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:50,342
I missed you.

689
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:04,089
Didn't think anything could
make you cry.

690
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,626
Guess I'm not
as tough as you thought.

691
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,667
So...

692
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:18,503
Why the running
mascara?

693
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:20,539
I had--

694
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,542
I just had a moment
with my sister.

695
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:26,011
It was a good one.

696
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:29,348
That's good.

697
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,783
Hey, Laurel's my big sister.

698
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,885
I still have room
for a little one.

699
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,121
Good.

700
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,724
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

701
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:44,196
Well, you won't have
to find out.

702
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:48,366
I'm going
to go find Roy.

703
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:09,354
Got it.

704
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:12,090
It's too late.

705
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:14,225
He's gone.

706
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:18,429
We're all going
to die here.

707
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,965
Just like him.

708
00:40:22,635 --> 00:40:25,603
No, we're not.

709
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:33,444
I think I found our way
on to the freighter.

710
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:37,248
Parachute.

711
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:05,576
Thea!

712
00:41:05,578 --> 00:41:08,612
Oliver.
What's wrong?

713
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:10,548
Is everything
all right?

714
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,850
Thea texted me there was
an emergency at the house.

715
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:14,985
No emergency.
I'm in the middle of a meeting

716
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,153
and Thea's
not even here.

717
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:18,255
Well, then why would she...

718
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:22,359
I can't believe she would do this.
Do what?

719
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:25,229
She's trying to force us to talk because
she's sensing the tension between us.

720
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:26,831
And what did you
tell her?

721
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,699
Nothing.

722
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:31,702
To protect her.

723
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,404
Not you.

724
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,840
Mrs. Queen.
Is everything ok?

725
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,175
Yes, thank you.

726
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:42,112
Uh, my son just
dropped by.

727
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:45,983
Oliver, I'd like you
to meet Slade Wilson.

728
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,026
It's a pleasure
to meet you...

729
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:58,061
Mr. Queen.
