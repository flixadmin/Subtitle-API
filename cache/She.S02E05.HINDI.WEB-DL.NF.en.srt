1
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,280
One swift clean stroke...

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,360
right across the neck.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,160
It should drain all the
blood out of his neck.

4
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>You must've hated it?</i>

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,680
I didn't.

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,560
Because I realized I was capable...

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,000
of killing someone I love.

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,600
I felt powerful.

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
People you hate...

10
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,760
killing them is ordinary.

11
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
It's easy.

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,160
But killing someone you love...

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,960
it gives you real power.

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,760
You'll do it as well.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
No.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
You will kill someone you love.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,200
No.

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll never do it again.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,520
I'll never kill anyone.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,640
I know you don't wanna do it right now.

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I understand the feeling.

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
But you will do it.

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,520
The sooner you do it...

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
the sooner you'll become like me.

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,080
The keys to the apartment.

26
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
Lokhande gave it to you?

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,840
I took it.

28
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm just here to give you the keys.

29
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,280
The apartment is yours.

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Lokhande won't bother you anymore.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,240
-Bye.
-Wait. Please have some tea.

32
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Rupa!

33
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Your cup...

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,240
it's in the kitchen.

35
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,520
How did you manage to kick Lokhande out?

36
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
Are you alright?

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,240
Why?

38
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't I look alright?

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,160
You look tired.

40
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Yeah.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm growing old, you see.

42
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm getting dark circles.

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
Rupa...

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,360
are you doing alright?

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
The expenses, I'm sure it's tough.

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,760
We're getting by.

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
Keep it.

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,240
You can always come
to me if you need money.

49
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,520
We need to look after each other, right?

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
Are you getting me?

51
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,040
If you ever need anything...

52
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
just let me know.

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
Take care.

54
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
What's up, whore?

55
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
Why are you running?

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Are you feeling disgusted, you whore?

57
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240
You're the one who's really disgusting!

58
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
Hands up, please.

59
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
What's going on?

60
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Sir, I've received a text from Nayak.

61
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
What?

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
{\an8}N - TOMORROW
BHUMI - WHO ARE YOU?

63
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
{\an8}N - IT'S ME
BHUMI - BUT HE'S DEAD

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
{\an8}N - DON'T WORRY WE'LL PICK YOU UP TOMORROW

65
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,520
But how?

66
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,040
How is it even possible?

67
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,800
Sir, what should I do?

68
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,600
Is it possible we killed
someone else in the encounter...

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,120
and Nayak's still alive?

70
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't know if there really is a Nayak.

71
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Bhumi is the only one who knows.

72
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,920
You don't trust her?

73
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,200
But we have to use her.

74
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
Right now...

75
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,120
she's the only connection
we have to Nayak.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,360
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,960
They've instructed me to
find out who the real Nayak is.

78
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,400
"Go to him if he calls you...

79
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,400
and stay there as long as you can."

80
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,440
So, call me?

81
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
Checking?

82
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,680
You shouldn't skip it.

83
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,320
The world's a terrible place.

84
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Come on. We've been told
to drop the blindfold as well.

85
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,640
Serious?

86
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,080
You'll be their only
source of information.

87
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,400
They'll be forced to lap up
everything you say.

88
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,560
I met a new man yesterday.

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,280
He was ordering people around.

90
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
He looked like a leader.

91
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,480
Maybe Nayak?

92
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Maybe.

93
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,640
Police's operation against Nayak...

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
will be controlled by Nayak himself.

95
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Through you.

96
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,320
We'll have them running
around like headless chickens.

97
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,400
It'll make our lives easier.

98
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
Our policy stays the same.

99
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,160
The truth...

100
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
with a pinch of lie.

101
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,120
Sir, I met a different man today.

102
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,240
He seemed to be the boss as well.

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
Sir, I met a third man this time!

104
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Sir, I met the first guy again.

105
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
I made a joke about
him being the real Nayak.

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,160
He said, "Everyone here is Nayak."

107
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,400
We have three different
descriptions from Bhumi,

108
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,120
so we don't know who
we are tracking right now.

109
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,160
I think the real Nayak never shows up.

110
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,200
He likes functioning from the shadows.

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
Sir, as it is, he was always a myth.

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,440
Maybe "Nayak" isn't one single man.

113
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,760
Like an organization?

114
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,280
Nayak could be a syndicate.

115
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
And Nayak...

116
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,080
will become a myth once again.

117
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Ooh la la!

118
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,440
Never show up early.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
I'm not ready for you yet.

120
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
You're looking alright.

121
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
You can't do much better anyway.

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
Shut up, Scrubby.

123
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm talking to him.

124
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,120
My heart's beating really fast right now.

125
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
Is Nayak one man?

126
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,680
-What do you mean?
-Or is it a group?

127
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Did one man call you from a single
number or were they different?

128
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,760
The numbers are unknown.

129
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
I would just get calls...

130
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
and instructions...

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
from different voices.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Sure?

133
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Nope.

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Your whore might know "for sure".

135
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,120
And whatever she tells you...

136
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
the opposite will be the truth.

137
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Nayak's just one man.

138
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,400
But you've never seen him?

139
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,240
Shetty used to always talk
about him like he's just one man.

140
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
But why did you lie to the hunk?

141
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
You know me, right?

142
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,040
My mouth spits out lies
before I gather my thoughts.

143
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,000
But what the hell is going on?

144
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't get it?

145
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
-We could talk to the whore?
-No!

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,200
She'll blurt it out to her pimp! Nayak!

147
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,280
But that's if Nayak
really does exist, right?

148
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,960
He could be one man
or he could be a group.

149
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,160
What does it matter?

150
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
Hey, shut up!

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
You guys are bumming me out.

152
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Just...

153
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,760
keep prodding the whore, alright?

154
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>We haven't covered
Navi Mumbai and Thane yet.</i>

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,240
Yeah, we'll need 17 girls in
Navi Mumbai and 19 in Thane.

156
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Who's gonna go there and talk to them?

157
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
You won't be going?

158
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,680
I can't do it all.

159
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,640
We're gonna get a huge consignment soon...

160
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
for Mumbai.

161
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,320
If we execute it properly...

162
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,880
we can move on to the next city.

163
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
I'll do it.

164
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
Sheela, you'll come with me.

165
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,320
And keep it tight.

166
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
I don't want any confusion.

167
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Give me a <i>mawa.</i> 120-300.

168
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,400
Hello, darling!

169
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,600
How's your grand comeback going?

170
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
Super-hit!

171
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,760
Super-hit? Really?

172
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
He dropped you off in two minutes!

173
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah, he was done in two minutes.

174
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,680
Really? I pee for more than two minutes.

175
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
Hey!

176
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,080
Listen to me.

177
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
I was just kidding!

178
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,080
-Look, your age...
-Why do you care?

179
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
Why would I care?

180
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm just making small talk.

181
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
You should leave.

182
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey!

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,800
What's with the tone?

184
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,160
-You know who I am, right?
-Yeah. What are you gonna do about it?

185
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,600
What's going on?

186
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,040
What are you guys doing?

187
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Nothing. What did we do?

188
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,480
Why are you adjusting your treasure trove?

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,160
What are you saying?

190
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
What are you hiding?

191
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,400
Show me!

192
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,680
Hey, don't touch me!

193
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
-Stop! I'll file a complaint against you!
-Fuck off! How dare you!

194
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,400
You're gonna file a complaint against me?

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Stop!

196
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
What the fuck!

197
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
-What the hell are you doing?!
-Give it back!

198
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
-You're making a mistake.
-Are you threatening me?

199
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,520
You fucking whore!

200
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
You're making a huge mistake, Bhonsle sir!

201
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:12,480
-You're making a huge mistake.
-You're going with her, you fucking hag!

202
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
You think you can threaten a cop?

203
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,640
Come on, fucking bitches!

204
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,120
Jai Hind, sir!

205
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,120
-What's up?
-Sir.

206
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Look, Tipu!

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm not gonna let them
off the hook this time.

208
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,800
I was being polite, alright?

209
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
-And your bloody...
-Go.

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,520
Hey! What the hell?

211
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
-Sir gave me the order.
-Who's "Sir"?

212
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,880
I gave her the order, Bhonsle.

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,720
Come on. Let's forget about
what happened, alright?

214
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,760
-You may leave.
-Okay, sir.

215
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,960
Hey, stop!

216
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
Sir, I've arrested them last night.

217
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
But you didn't file
an official report, right?

218
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
That's great.

219
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,240
Sir, they were carrying...

220
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,280
Shut up.

221
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Sorry, Tipu <i>Seth.</i>

222
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,920
-Goodbye.
-Thank you, sir.

223
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,040
Come on.

224
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Sir!

225
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,280
Sir, you humiliated me in front of
that bloody pimp and his whores...

226
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,760
I had received an order from the top!

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
Please try and understand.

228
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,120
Forget about it.

229
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,640
An order from the top?

230
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,000
For him?

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was from the bloody summit.

232
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
If you ever see them again...

233
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
just look away, alright?

234
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Get back to work.

235
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,520
-A call from the top?
-Yeah!

236
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
But I didn't talk to anyone.

237
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
Who called them?

238
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
Well, that's your...

239
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,760
power, right?!

240
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,040
You don't even need to make
a bloody phone call anymore!

241
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
It was all automatic!

242
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
Hey, tell her about Bhonsle's sad face!

243
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,240
Oh, yeah!

244
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
That was fun!

245
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,200
When we gave him a glare he
acted like his lips were sewn shut!

246
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,320
<i>This can't go on, sir!</i>

247
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,320
Every time she comes
with some new information,

248
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,960
she drops it on us like a bomb!

249
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,240
We have to sit and figure this out, sir.

250
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Okay.

251
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,280
Now let's debate this.

252
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,680
Right?

253
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Say, I am for Bhumi

254
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,520
and you are against her.

255
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
And then we'll switch sides later.

256
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,880
Alright?

257
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Okay.

258
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,440
We executed some man named Nayak,
just because Bhumi said so.

259
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
And the Nayak syndicate has
no clue about her involvement?

260
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,400
Maybe the syndicate
wanted that Nayak dead.

261
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,240
But that means she's working for them.

262
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,680
Probably, she doesn't know.

263
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,600
She doesn't know?

264
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
Bhumi knows everything, sir.

265
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
She knows everything.

266
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,960
Do you think so?

267
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,720
You know her really well, right?

268
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,600
I used to, sir.

269
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
But she's changed.

270
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,240
Probably, that's just the nature
of this operation, Fernandez.

271
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,960
But, sir, all the information
that we've received

272
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,560
about this whole syndicate theory so far,

273
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
we've got it from Bhumi!

274
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,120
We don't have any other source
to confirm this information either.

275
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,880
It's too much power to
give to one single person.

276
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,160
What are our options, sir?

277
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Just keep going.

278
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
At the same time,
keep these doubts in our minds.

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,040
Give me a <i>mawa.</i>

280
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Rupa, I'm reheating the chicken for you.

281
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,360
How many seconds
do I keep it in the microwave?

282
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,800
Ten? Twenty?

283
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,400
Tell me.

284
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,480
Hey!

285
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,160
Rupa!

286
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,000
Why can't you answer me?

287
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
Hey, Rupa!

288
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Rupa!

289
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,200
Hello?

290
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,160
Bhumi! Ru... Rupa!

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
"Rupa" What? Mom, what's wrong?

292
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,680
Bhumi, please get here as soon as you can!

293
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,240
-You're her sister?
-Yes.

294
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
What's the patient's name?

295
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,960
Rupali Pardeshi.

296
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,280
Did she have any allergies?
Was she on any medications?

297
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,520
No, she didn't even need a Crocin!

298
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
She has ingested something.

299
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
Could it be a suicide attempt?

300
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,920
-What are you saying?
-No!

301
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,320
Was she using any substances?

302
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
I mean, drugs?

303
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
Okay, please have a seat.

304
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
We had to pump her stomach.

305
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,280
We've found psychotropic drugs.

306
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,960
Are you getting what I'm saying?

307
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,240
Rupa was using drugs?

308
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,160
You didn't know about it?

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
It's a case of drug overdose.

310
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>I never tried it again.</i>

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,280
Just... one time.

312
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,080
But Rupa wanted more.

313
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,800
I tried to stop her!

314
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,440
Hey, Rupa!

315
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
You should stop it.

316
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,960
-Please stop.
-Shut up!

317
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,240
Aren't you ashamed to even talk to me?

318
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
Rupa, listen to me.

319
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,920
-Stop!
-I won't!

320
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
What are you gonna do about it?

321
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,520
Sleep with my sister?

322
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
Bloody perverts!

323
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
I told my friend,

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,400
warned him to stop selling to Rupa.

325
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,720
But everyone's selling it
like chewing gum these days.

326
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
She found it somehow.

327
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>I've found 17 girls in Vashi.</i>

328
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,960
Here are their names and numbers.

329
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Vashi is set.

330
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,160
You can tell us where
we're focusing next...

331
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,680
Are you alright?

332
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
It's fine for now.

333
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,040
But we need to supply it throughout
Mumbai, all at once, next time.

334
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
I'll tell you when it's time.

335
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,120
And who's gonna tell you when it's time?

336
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,760
I mean, we should know who
we are working for, right?

337
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,680
You're working for me.

338
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,360
That's all you need to know.

339
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
Is that alright?

340
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
Of course!

341
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,560
The less we know the better.

342
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
No, you say it!

343
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
Is that alright?

344
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,880
Yes, of course.

345
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
I was just curious.

346
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,040
Hey!

347
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,080
Yasmin, what's wrong with you?

348
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,040
You should handle your lover, Bhonsle.

349
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,120
He seems to be equally curious.

350
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
-Are you calling me a rat?
-Yeah.

351
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
He's already sniffing around.

352
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,880
Let him!

353
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,680
Last time? You remember, right?

354
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,640
We'll handle him.

355
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Hey, I don't need you all.

356
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,280
I can handle him by myself.

357
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,760
Can you?

358
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,160
He could be a pain in the ass.

359
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,120
But you could...

360
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,240
bring him on our side.

361
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,560
How?

362
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I'll tell you.

363
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
Hey, what happened?

364
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,760
I think he's consumed poison.

365
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
The body has turned blue.

366
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
Or he could've eaten some junk.

367
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,320
<i>I had to.</i>

368
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
You had told him too much.

369
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,640
It isn't easy.

370
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
Not everyone can tread this path.

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
This pain...

372
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,800
this "dirty" feeling...

373
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
it'll never go away.

374
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,320
You'll have to become strong.

375
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
That's the only way.

376
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,000
That's the only way you can handle it.

377
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
You wanna be strong, right?

378
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,160
Yes.

379
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Please.

380
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Good.

381
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,840
That boy, Amey...

382
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
do you love him?

383
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,880
No.

384
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
But you do like him, right?

385
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
Do you feel for him?

386
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,320
Kill him.

387
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
He has to go anyway.

388
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,520
He does have a hint about what you do.

389
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
And he's weak.

390
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,160
He really loves you.

391
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
His love for you won't be wasted.

392
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
It'll make you strong.

393
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,520
Hey! Give me a gun.

394
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,080
Thank you.

395
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
You decide how you wanna do it.

396
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,680
And do it alone.

397
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,440
It's easier.

398
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,520
I want the power...

399
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,520
you have inside you.

400
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,920
You'll get it.

401
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,320
You're a natural.

402
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Please pull over.

403
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,640
Bhumi!

404
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,560
Bhumi?

405
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
Give me your phone.

406
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,440
Bhumi!

407
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,680
I was thinking...

408
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,560
we could leave Mumbai for good...

409
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,880
if you wanna come with me.

410
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
What do you think?

411
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,440
What's wrong?

412
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,880
-Sit here. Just stay there.
-What's wrong, Bhumi?

413
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
-Are you okay, Bhumi?
-Just sit there!

414
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,360
Sit down.

415
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
What's going on, Bhumi?
What's wrong?

416
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,960
Are you mad at me, Bhumi?

417
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,080
-Bhumi, we could...
-Stay away from me!

418
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,120
Stay away!

419
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,640
Just tell me what you wanna do, Bhumi.
I'm ready to do anything...

420
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,440
Bhumi, what's...

421
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,280
You're right. You should
leave Mumbai for good.

422
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,520
Okay?

423
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,480
Take your family and get out of here.

424
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,280
And delete everything you have
about me on this phone.

425
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,000
Go away, as far as you can.

426
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
Alright?

427
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,760
And never come back.

428
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,960
Sorry.

429
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,520
I couldn't do it.

430
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
I rushed it.

431
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
It's my fault.

432
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
No.

433
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Yes.

434
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,440
I expect a lot from you.

435
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,480
And I like that.

436
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,080
Come.

437
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,200
Watch.

438
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,240
Do it.

439
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,560
Watch it!

440
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
Don't waste it!

441
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,640
Look!

442
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,560
I'll give you another shot, Bhumi.

443
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,360
It's way better than this idea.

444
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,760
And you don't have to rush it this time.

445
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
You can take it slow.

446
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
Take your time.

447
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,480
Do it when you're mentally ready.

448
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,000
You have two weeks.

449
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,760
Okay?

450
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,000
My job here will be done in two weeks.

451
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,120
I might go away for a few days.

452
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
And after I leave...

453
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
you can finish off Rupa.

454
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,280
Perfect.

455
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,120
You hate her.

456
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,320
But you love her as well, right?

457
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,400
A lot more, right now.

458
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,600
She's your sister.

459
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
You've grown up together.

460
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,080
She might give you more power...

461
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,440
than the power Chinnanna gave me!

462
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,320
And then, Bhumi...

463
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,760
you'll never be weak again.

464
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I've left my phone at the hotel.

465
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
I want to talk to you, sir.

466
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
