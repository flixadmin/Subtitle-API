-Just relax.

-I'm sure he's fine.
-He said it would only be an hour.

159

That was nine hours ago.

If he's going to be late, he always calls.

He said his contact
was down at the docks, right?

No offense, but you're just Maseo's wife.

Trust me, I'm saving you

I don't need saving from anyone.

182
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,026
Carrie Cutter. She's former S.C.P.D.
She was the first woman SWAT team member.

183
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,320
I've seen her before.

184
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,990
She's not unpretty for a wacko,
if you're into the red-headed vixen type.

185
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,494
-She was police. That's why she looks familiar.
-No, she left the force before you got back.

186
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,539
But there's another very good reason
she looks familiar.

187

Why was she at the crime scene
at Ted Grant's gym?

I don't know, but it's not just there.

She's a member of a gardening group too.

-What NPP thing?

The bag in the Gravano hostage photo.
NPP is an acronym.

192
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,103
Stands for "nitrogen, phosphate, potash."
It's the chemical formula for fertilizer.
