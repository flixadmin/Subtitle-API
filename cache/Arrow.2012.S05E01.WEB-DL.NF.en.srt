I AM A NORMAL VERSION

AFTER EVERYTHING

THAT HAPPENED
WITH LAUREL, I...

489
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,580

THAT LIFE LIKE THIS

AND I DIDN'T,

555

BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT TAKING THE HIGH ROAD

556
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,899
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN SAVING LIVES,

557

TAKE DARHK DOWN FOR GOOD,

00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,893
NOT THAT I'VE EVER
BEEN ON ANY, BUT...

643
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,395
FELICITY: WILD DOG
ISN'T A SUPERHERO.

644
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,771
HE'S A VIGILANTE.

645
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,273
YOU ARE REALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN

646
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,399
THE DISTINCTION TO ME.

647
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,858
EITHER WAY,
WE'D HAVE BETTER LUCK

648
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,110
WITH AN AD IN THE PAPER.

649
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,445
NO ONE READS
THE CLASSIFIEDS ANYMORE.

650
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,696
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
COME ON BACK,

651
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:41,947
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
OUR NEXT MOVE?

652
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,657
YOU GOT IT.

653
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,162
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

654
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,998
[PHONE RINGING]

655
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,418
JOHN, ON PHONE:
HEY, THIS IS JOHN.

656
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,210
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

657
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,211
[BEEP]

658
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,254
HEY, JOHN.

659
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,922
UH...

660
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,175
I HOPE THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING WELL OVER THERE.

661
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,721
LISTEN, NO PRESSURE,

662
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,765
BUT GIVE ME A CALL BACK
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE.

663
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,933
I HAVE A QUESTION

664
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,478
I FIGURE YOU PROBABLY
HAVE AN ANSWER.

665
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,187
BE WELL.

666
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,485
LONELY AT THE TOP,
MR. MAYOR?

667
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,113
ACTUALLY, BEING THE MAYOR
ISN'T THE JOB THAT'S LONELY.

668
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,657
THEA?

669
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,576
THEA'S NOT COMING BACK.

670
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,536
NEITHER IS JOHN.

671
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,497
THERE'S A RUSSIAN
PROVERB.

672
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,292
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT RECENTLY.

673
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,379
AKULA, KOTORYA NE
PLAVAYET, NE TONET.

674
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,718
"THE SHARK THAT
DOES NOT SWIM

675
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,970
DROWNS."

676
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,807
YOU DON'T MOVE FORWARD,
YOU DIE.

677
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,101
LISTEN, YOU WILL DIE
IF YOU TRY TAKING ON

678
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,687
THIS TOBIAS CHURCH
BY YOURSELF.

679
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,188
THERE'S NO MORE TEAM,
QUENTIN,

680
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,106
AND I CAN'T TRUST ANYONE
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

681
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,191
THEN DON'T.

682
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,568
JUST TRUST THESE GUYS.

683
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,115
LIEUTENANT CONAHAN.

684
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,617
I TRAINED HIM
BACK IN THE DAY.

685
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,577
THE GUY'S SO CLEAN,
HE DOESN'T EVEN DOUBLE PARK,

686
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,413
AND HE'S VOUCHED
FOR EACH OF THESE OFFICERS.

687
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,540
TO DO WHAT?

688
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,711
TO HELP YOU
WHATEVER WAY WE CAN.

689
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,295
"WE"?

690
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,215
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
ANY RUSSIAN PROVERBS,
ALL RIGHT,

691
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,175
BUT BOTH OF US HAVE
GOT TO MOVE ON.

692
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,926
YEAH.

693
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,179
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING
TO BE A BIGGER FIGHT.

694
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,140
THAT'S WHAT LAUREL
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

695
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,019
AFTER TONIGHT,

696
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,524
I REALIZED
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

697
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,860
WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOU
TO MAKE ME A PROMISE.

698
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,616
ANYTHING.

699
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,786
PLEASE...

700
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,248
PLEASE DON'T LET ME
BE THE LAST CANARY.

701
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,624
THAT WAY,

702
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,960
A PART OF ME WILL ALWAYS
BE OUT THERE WITH YOU.

703
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,548
I PROMISE.

704
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,141
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE.

705
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,728
I'M GOING TO GRAB A SMOKE.

706
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,106
WE'RE IN.

707
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,357
LANCE: COPY THAT.

708
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,983
CONAHAN: I'M GOING
TO DISARM THE BOMBS.

709
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,360
FISHER WILL TAKE THE OTHERS
AND GET THE COUNCILMEN.

710
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,445
ALL RIGHT.

711
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,446
WATCH YOUR BACK,
ALL RIGHT?

712
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,865
I'VE GOT YOU FROM HERE.

713
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:33,034
AND WHERE DO THEY THINK
"HERE" IS, EXACTLY?

714
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,411
I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT.

715
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,495
FELICITY: I AM JEALOUS.

716
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,789
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET OLIVER

717
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,998
TO WORK WITH A TEAM
FOR WEEKS NOW.

718
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,292
THEY'RE NOT A TEAM!

719
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,376
WELL, YOU CAN
LOOK IT UP.

720
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,586
A TEAM IS
"A GROUP OF PERSONS

721
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,755
ASSOCIATED
WITH A JOINT ACTION."

722
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,303
DUCK...

723
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,099
DUCK...

724
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,104
GOOSE.

725
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,944
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

726
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,080
HEY!

727
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,499
DON'T WORRY.

728
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,417
AFTER I KILL YOU,

729
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,085
I'M GOING TO LET
THE HOSTAGES GO.

730
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,671
I PROMISE.

731
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
[MEN GRUNTING]

732
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,990
OFFICER: RECEIVING
HEAVY FIRE.

733
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,616
-FISHER?!
-I NEED BACKUP.

734
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,159
CONAHAN,
FISHER'S CATCHING HEAT.

735
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,160
CAN YOU ASSIST?

736
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,161
CONAHAN: NEGATIVE.

737
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,245
WE GOT A BIGGER
PROBLEM.

738
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,873
CHURCH HAS WIRED
THE CONDUCTOR.

739
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,123
THE CONDUCTOR IS
IN THE CENTER OF...

740
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,709
IF IT GOES, THE WHOLE
BUILDING IS GOING TO BLOW.

741
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,960
YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

742
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,296
NOT WITHOUT CHURCH!

743
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,466
THE WHOLE POWER PLANT
IS GOING TO GO UP.

744
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,968
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO TO STOP IT.

745
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,096
GET THEM OUT OF HERE!

746
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,097
I'LL DISARM THE CORDON.

747
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,516
I'M ON IT!

748
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,859
OVERWATCH!

749
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:29,860
HOSTAGES ARE SAFE.

750
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,945
YOU HAVE MAYBE 5 SECONDS.

751
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,839
HEY!

752
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,340
KEEP HER FLYING!

753
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,373
OLIVER: GOOD MORNING.

754
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,042
I HAD INTENDED
TO STATE MY POSITION

755
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,501
ON THE ANTI-CRIME INITIATIVE

756
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,670
DURING THE CITY'S TRIBUTE
TO THE BLACK CANARY,

757
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,048
BUT THAT SPEECH
WAS CUT SHORT.

758
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,173
IN THE INTERVENING DAYS,

759
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,259
I HAVE REFINED
MY POSITION.

760
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,720
NOW, I HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT
TO EMBRACE THE A.C.I.

761
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,513
BECAUSE OF WIDESPREAD
CORRUPTION

762
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,724
WITHIN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT,

763
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,517
BUT THESE 4 OFFICERS

764
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,436
HAVE SHOWN ME
AND THE ENTIRE CITY

765
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:50,231
THAT THERE ARE STILL GOOD
MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SCPD.

766
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,191
TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING
THE FORMATION

767
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,111
OF THE ANTI-CRIME UNIT.

768
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,947
THESE 4 OFFICERS WILL
REPORT DIRECTLY TO ME,

769
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,032
AND BY WORKING TOGETHER,

770
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:03,411
WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS
OF SAVING OUR CITY.

771
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,581
[APPLAUSE]

772
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,042
CHURCH: I THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING OUT.

773
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,127
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

774
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,545
FOR DECIDING
TO HEAR MY VISION.

775
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,381
THE GREEN ARROW
CANNOT BE STOPPED

776
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,050
UNLESS...

777
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,927
UNLESS WE ALL
WORK TOGETHER

778
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,221
UNDER A SINGULAR COMMAND.

779
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,975
AND I SUPPOSE THAT
LEADER WOULD BE YOU.

780
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,393
YOU NEED SOMEONE
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

781
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,063
I KNOW THIS
BECAUSE IT TOOK ME
LESS THAN 12 HOURS

782
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,398
TO GET INSIDE
YOUR ORGANIZATIONS,

783
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,275
ALL OF THEM.

784
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,235
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

785
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,238
GET INSIDE?

786
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,407
[GUNSHOT]

787
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,413
IT MEANS THAT,
MR. BERTINELLI.

788
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,249
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

789
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,376
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
OUT CELEBRATING

790
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,544
AFTER YOUR BIG WIN.

791
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,253
IT WASN'T EXACTLY A WIN.

792
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,131
YOU WENT FROM BEING
THE DO-NOTHING MAYOR

793
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,550
TO THE ROCK STAR MAYOR
IN UNDER 24 HOURS.

794
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,385
I WOULD SAY THAT
THAT QUALIFIES.

795
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,928
CHURCH IS STILL
OUT THERE.

796
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,304
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

797
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,931
WHAT, WITH YOUR NEW UNIT
OF SUPER COPS

798
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:05,974
AND THE NEW TEAM
OF VIGILANTES

799
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,100
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE RECRUITING,

800
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,894
CHURCH IS GOING TO SEE
THE INSIDE OF A CELL

801
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:09,644
IN NO TIME.

802
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,854
I SEE WHAT
YOU DID THERE.

803
