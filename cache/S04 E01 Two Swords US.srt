1
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
Magnificent.

2
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,358
-Looks fresh-forged.
-It is.

3
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,279
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword
since the Doom of Valyria.

4
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,700
There are three living smiths
who know how to rework Valyrian steel.

5
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,495
The finest of them was in Volantis.

6
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,581
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.

7
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,625
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?

8
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,919
From someone who no longer had need of it.

9
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,633
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.

10
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,343
-And now we have two.
-Two?

11
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,806
The original weapon was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel for two swords.

12
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,266
Well, thank you. It's glorious.

13
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
You'll have to train your left hand.

14
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,945
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

15
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,154
You'll never be as good.

16
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,367
No. But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

17
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,451
I suppose it doesn't matter.

18
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,497
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

19
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,126
Where's that written? I can and I will.
The Kingsguard oath is for life.

20
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,295
-The war is over. The king is safe.
-The king is never safe.

21
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,674
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

22
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,010
Other knights protected the king
while you were a prisoner.

23
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,846
They will continue to do so
when you go home.

24
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,307
-Home?
-You'll return to Casterly Rock

25
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,562
-and rule in my stead.
-You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

26
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,316
I am the King's Hand. My place is here.

27
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,737
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.

28
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,072
You know what they call me?

29
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,285
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
Man without honor.

30
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,704
Now, you want me
to break another sacred vow.

31
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,415
You won't be breaking anything.

32
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,085
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

33
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,546
The king will exercise that prerogative.

34
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,299
-No.
-No?

35
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,926
No.

36
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,597
-I don't believe I asked you a question.
-There's my answer.

37
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,807
If you think your bloody honor
comes before--

38
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,227
My bloody honor is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.

39
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,022
I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want
a wife. I don't want children.

40
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,106
What do you want?

41
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,651
Supper would be nice.

42
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,906
For 40 years I've tried to teach you.

43
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,700
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.

44
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:14,499
Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard
is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

45
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,419
-I suppose you want the sword back.
-Keep it.

46
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,799
A one-handed man with no family
needs all the help he can get.

47
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,412
How many Dornishmen does it take
to fuck a goat?

48
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,413
Please don't.

49
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,459
Seems to me the smart place

50
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,754
to meet travelers is in a tavern.
That way, one party is late,

51
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,549
the other party
can drink some ale inside.

52
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,

53
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,219
not one of your sellsword friends.

54
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,889
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

55
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,436
There's bad blood
between the Martells of Dorne

56
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,189
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.

57
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,277
And just in case the Martells of Dorne
are looking to spill some Lannister blood,

58
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,611
it may as well be yours.

59
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,281
No need for cynicism.
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

60
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,285
Here we are.

61
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,747
Can you read the sigils?

62
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,626
Yellow balls?

63
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,588
Wild lemons on a purple field,
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

64
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,885
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House Blackmont.

65
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,013
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

66
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,640
-Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
-I need a sigil.

67
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,060
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

68
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,688
I don't see it, my lord.

69
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,737
Well met, my lords. His Grace
King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.

70
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,740
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

71
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,285
I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock,
Master of Coin.

72
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,585
Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran
in your company.

73
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,422
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.

74
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,844
He sends his brother Prince Oberyn
to attend the royal wedding in his stead.

75
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,141
Yes, the king would be delighted
to enjoy the company

76
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,312
of a warrior as renowned
as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.

77
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,730
Will he?

78
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,193
-And where is Prince Oberyn?
-Arrived before dawn.

79
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,529
Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.

80
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,660
Very well. My lords,
these fine men from the City Watch

81
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,162
will escort you
to your quarters in the Red Keep.

82
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,082
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

83
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,378
...take it all back to the tent!

84
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,715
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.
Now where?

85
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,550
We must find Prince Oberyn

86
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,803
before he kills somebody
or several somebodies.

87
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,306
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?

88
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,433
You're famous
for fucking half of Westeros.

89
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,353
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad road,

90
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,396
where would you go?

91
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,774
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

92
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,633
Look at this one.

93
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,178
How lovely is she?

94
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,016
Beautiful. But pale.

95
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,978
They like them pale in the capital.
Shows they don't work the fields.

96
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,607
Do I frighten you?

97
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,571
-You like?
-Timid.

98
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,531
Timid bores me.

99
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,290
You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

100
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,879
-I think she likes you.
-She has good taste.

101
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,342
You're not timid, are you?

102
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,098
Not timid.

103
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,269
-Do you like women?
-When they look like her, my lord.

104
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,396
This one will do nicely.

105
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,359
-Very good, my lady.
-I'm not a lady.

106
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,821
-A term of courtesy in this establishment.
-A lie anywhere.

107
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,825
Why not use the right words?
I'm a bastard.

108
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,454
She is a whore. And you're what?

109
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,456
A procurer.

110
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,833
Any of the others?

111
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,381
-The two girls can leave.
-You stay.

112
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,009
I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.

113
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,053
Everyone who works for Littlefinger
is an offer.

114
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,099
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

115
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,643
-My lord.
-I am a prince, boy.

116
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,979
Have you ever been with a prince?

117
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,816
Can't say I have.

118
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,113
I'm wildly expensive.

119
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,450
Take off your clothes.

120
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,334
Which way do you like it?

121
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,588
My way.

122
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,559
Oberyn.

123
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,311
Oberyn, don't.

124
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,736
Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall

125
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,826
And not a soul to hear

126
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,171
-You lost, friend?
-Forgive me for staring.

127
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,175
I don't see many Lannisters
where I'm from.

128
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,052
I don't see many Dornishmen
in the capital.

129
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,179
We don't like the smell.

130
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,017
-Come with me, lover.
-Gods, look at this one.

131
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,019
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

132
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,062
Why are you wasting a woman like this
on a Dornishman?

133
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,565
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

134
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,740
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

135
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,541
You think your gold, and your lions,

136
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,336
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

137
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,218
May I tell you a secret?
You're not a golden lion.

138
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,806
You're just a pink little man
who is far too slow on the draw.

139
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,152
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

140
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,613
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

141
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,199
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

142
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,203
He'll live if you get him help
straightaway.

143
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,999
So, decisions.

144
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,631
Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
We heard there might be trouble.

145
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,510
Apologies, my love.

146
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,768
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

147
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,234
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

148
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,574
The king's own Uncle Imp.
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

149
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,701
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay in King's Landing--

150
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,327
What are you? His hired killer?

151
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,664
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

152
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,209
-How did that come to pass?
-Killed the right people, I suppose.

153
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,425
We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

154
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,386
-You don't partake?
-I partook.

155
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,387
Now, I'm married.

156
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,640
Prince Oberyn,
if I may, a word in private?

157
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,398
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

158
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,942
-They take all kinds.
-Even Dornishmen.

159
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,529
The king is very grateful that you
traveled all this way for his wedding.

160
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,407
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

161
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,660
I am only the second son after all.

162
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,954
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

163
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,874
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

164
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,794
Why did you come to King's Landing,
Prince Oberyn?

165
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,465
-I was invited to the royal wedding.
-I thought we were speaking truth.

166
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,594
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

167
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,262
Another wedding.

168
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,143
My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

169
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,566
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

170
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,986
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

171
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,155
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse
touch them.

172
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,034
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen

173
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,245
left her for another woman.

174
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,708
That started a war
and the war ended right here

175
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,670
when your father's army took the city…

176
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,215
-I wasn't actually present.
-…and butchered those children.

177
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,843
My nephew and niece.

178
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,764
Carved them up and wrapped them
in Lannister cloaks.

179
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,269
And my sister,
you know what they did to her?

180
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,776
-I'm asking you a question.
-I've heard rumors.

181
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,237
So have I.

182
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,950
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

183
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,204
raped Elia and split her in half
with his great sword.

184
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,622
I wasn't there.

185
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,749
-I don't know what happened.
-If the Mountain killed my sister,

186
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,626
your father gave the order.

187
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,629
Tell your father I'm here.

188
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,510
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

189
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,222
They're dragons, Khaleesi.
They can never be tamed.

190
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,016
Not even by their mother.

191
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,082
-Ser Barristan.
-Your Grace.

192
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,795
Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?

193
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,799
Gambling, Your Grace.

194
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,885
Gambling?

195
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,122
-Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa…
-Mhysa.

196
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,125
-Mhysa. Mhysa.
-Mhysa. Mhysa.

197
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,921
How long have they been at it?

198
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,965
Since midnight, Your Grace.

199
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,343
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.

200
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,178
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

201
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,389
What's the prize
for winning this stupid contest?

202
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,808
The honor of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.

203
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,020
That honor goes
to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

204
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,689
as neither of them kept me waiting
this morning.

205
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,151
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

206
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,740
The last man holding his sword
can find a new queen to fight for.

207
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,230
You need to eat something.

208
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,151
Pigeon pie.

209
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,320
No, thank you.

210
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,951
Lemon cakes?

211
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,121
-No, thank you.
-You love lemon cakes.

212
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,168
-Tell her she needs to eat.
-My lady, you do need to eat.

213
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,711
I don't want to eat.

214
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,133
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

215
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,978
She needs to eat.

216
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,698
I can't let you starve.
I swore to protect you.

217
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,917
My lady, I am your husband.
Let me help you.

218
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,465
-How can you help me?
-I don't know, but I can try.

219
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,346
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

220
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,558
thinking about how they died.

221
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,936
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

222
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,980
Do you know what they did to my brother?

223
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,235
How they sewed his direwolf's head
onto his body?

224
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,363
And my mother.

225
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,243
They say they cut her throat to the bone
and threw her body in the river.

226
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,205
What happened to your family
was a terrible crime.

227
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,127
I didn't know your brother. He seemed
like a good man, but I didn't know him.

228
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,840
Your mother, on the other hand...
I admired her.

229
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,302
She wanted to have me executed,
but I admired her.

230
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,473
She was a strong woman.

231
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,269
And she was fierce
when it came to protecting her children.

232
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,356
Sansa.

233
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,780
Your mother would want you to carry on.
You know it's true.

234
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,121
Will you pardon me, my lord?
I'd like to visit the Godswood.

235
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,999
Of course. Of course.
Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

236
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,085
I don't pray anymore.

237
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,339
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

238
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,150
My lion.

239
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,529
What are you doing?

240
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,244
What does it look like I'm doing?
Come here.

241
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,871
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

242
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,916
I know. I know. We have come
to a dangerous place.

243
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,461
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

244
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:46,341
-Of course, I haven't forgotten.
-I want you. Don't you want me?

245
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,805
-Things are a bit tense right now.
-What things?

246
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,808
My nephew the king wants to murder me.

247
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,811
My wife hates me
because my father murdered her family.

248
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,856
Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone
whose last name is Lannister.

249
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,277
You need to relax.

250
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,496
Don't you want to relax?

251
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,545
-What's wrong?
-I told you.

252
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,423
-It's not a good time.
-It's never a good time.

253
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,050
-You have your child bride now.
-Shae.

254
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,928
-Do you love her?
-Love her?

255
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,473
I barely know her.
She's a child. She despises me.

256
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,934
-That's not an answer.
-Of course, I don't love her.

257
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,854
You tried to ship me away.

258
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,148
Ship you away?

259
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,987
-Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
-What in the world are you talking about?

260
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,614
If you want me to leave, just say it.

261
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,742
Say it!

262
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,703
I don't know what you're talking about.

263
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,289
You want me to stay?

264
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,152
A work of art, really.

265
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,656
The craftsmanship is excellent.

266
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,700
You like it so much, you're welcome
to chop off your own hand and take it.

267
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,535
You're such an ingrate.
I spent days with the goldsmith

268
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,996
-getting the details just right.
-Days?

269
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,374
Better part of an afternoon.

270
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,918
There, how does that feel?

271
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,924
-A hook would be more practical.
-Elegant, I think.

272
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,848
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

273
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,309
-The symptoms have abated?
-Gone completely.

274
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,727
I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

275
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,231
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

276
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,994
-Odd little man.
-I've grown rather fond of him.

277
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,330
-He's quite talented, you know?
-What symptoms?

278
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,127
-Symptoms that are not your concern.
-You let him touch you?

279
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,212
You jealous?

280
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,133
I'm surprised.
You never let Pycelle near you.

281
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,344
You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

282
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,056
He smells like a dead cat.

283
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm not sure
I've ever smelled a dead cat.

284
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,062
-Well, they smell like Pycelle.
-You drink more than you used to.

285
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,607
-Yes.
-Why?

286
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,987
Let's see, you started a brawl
in the streets with Ned Stark

287
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,363
and disappeared from the capital.

288
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,742
My husband died
in a tragic hunting accident.

289
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,452
It must have been traumatic for you.

290
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,995
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.

291
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,664
-We suffered through a siege.
-A rather short siege.

292
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,584
A rather short siege
that I didn't expect to survive.

293
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,796
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden

294
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,633
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow biter. So…

295
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,345
Father disowned me today.

296
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,974
-He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
-You're forgetting Tyrion.

297
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,354
You don't really plan
on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?

298
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,070
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

299
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,238
in the Red Keep with you.

300
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,492
-Not now.
-I want...

301
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,787
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

302
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,794
-Something's changed.
-Everything's changed.

303
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,922
You come back after all this time
with no apologies

304
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,424
and one hand and expect everything
to be the same?

305
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,843
-What do you want me to apologize for?
-For leaving me.

306
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,512
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

307
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:06,059
I don't know what you wanted,
you weren't here. You left me alone.

308
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,396
Every day, I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape. Every day.

309
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,190
I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

310
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,025
-You took too long.
-I…

311
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,488
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying you took too long.

312
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,116
-Come in.
-Go away.

313
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,119
Forgive me, Your Grace.

314
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,747
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

315
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,311
You plan
on killing all the crows yourself?

316
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,024
Do you plan on sitting here
scratching your balls till winter?

317
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
We wait for Mance's orders.

318
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,404
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.

319
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,489
If he's not back yet,
he's not coming back.

320
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,243
And what is it you want?
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

321
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,288
Your pretty crow said 1,000 men
are nesting there.

322
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,665
-Yeah, well, he's a liar.
-He is?

323
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,960
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

324
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,839
-You said you put three arrows in him.
-And I did.

325
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,260
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

326
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,431
If that boy's still walking,
it's because you let him go.

327
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,960
Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.

328
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,056
Mance sent you?

329
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,433
How did you find us?

330
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,066
You came from the south, not the north.

331
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:23,571
Took a detour. Got some supper
from a village down that way.

332
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,077
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

333
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,120
than it does on our side of the Wall?

334
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,789
Help yourself.

335
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:41,130
Maybe everything's just better
fed down here. Fat and lazy.

336
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,925
Easier for us.

337
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,513
You didn't see us coming?

338
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,015
Lost your warg?

339
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:58,523
And that baby crow you had with you,
lost him too?

340
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,737
I'll answer to Mance.
I won't answer to you.

341
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,365
She yours?

342
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,452
I'm not anybody's.

343
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:26,259
Too scrawny.
Not like those crows at Castle Black.

344
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,221
Think of them stuck in their larders

345
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,766
stuffing their faces
with ham, and blood sausage

346
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,730
and stew,
getting nice, and fat, and marbled.

347
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,734
I know we've had our differences,
Tormund,

348
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,030
but just one time before you die,

349
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,825
you really ought to try crow.

350
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,956
Draw. Loose.

351
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,759
Last time I saw him,
he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.

352
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,849
He said, "Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black."

353
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,271
I was jealous of Robb my whole life.

354
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,234
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

355
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,571
He was better than me at everything...

356
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:35,370
fighting, and hunting, and riding,

357
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,333
and girls. Gods, the girls loved him.

358
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,921
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

359
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,093
Sometimes I want to hate you.

360
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,140
Well, you're better than me
at everything.

361
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,936
Except reading.

362
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,192
They're... they're ready for you.

363
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,241
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

364
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,535
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

365
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,413
I've done plenty wrong.

366
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,625
So, you admit
you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

367
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,003
-I didn't murder him.
-No?

368
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,674
You put your sword
through a brother of the Night's Watch.

369
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,217
What do you call that?

370
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,761
He wanted me to kill him.

371
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,473
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

372
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,892
The Halfhand believed our only chance
to stop Mance

373
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,477
was to get a man inside his army.

374
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,356
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him. He was my brother.

375
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,525
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

376
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,486
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him--

377
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,991
The free folk? Listen to him.
He even talks like a wildling now.

378
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,952
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

379
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,204
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I…

380
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,250
I lay with a wildling girl.

381
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,880
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

382
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,174
I do.

383
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,886
The law is the law. The boy must die.

384
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:19,140
If we beheaded
every ranger who lay with a girl,

385
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,894
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.

386
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,731
There's a difference between sneaking
off to the Mole's Town brothel

387
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,816
and sleeping with the enemy.

388
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,488
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

389
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,742
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

390
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,826
Impossible.

391
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,830
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

392
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,042
One hundred thousand.
He's united the Thenns,

393
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,212
the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans.
He has giants fighting for him.

394
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,213
Giants?

395
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,675
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

396
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,136
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

397
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,764
And now you're here. You must
not have been very good at your job.

398
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,725
-How dare you?
-There's a band of wildlings

399
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,060
south of the Wall already

400
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,939
led by Tormund Giantsbane.
I killed their warg and three others.

401
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,774
They shot me full of arrows.

402
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,903
Their orders are to attack Castle Black
from the south

403
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,822
when Mance hits it from the north.

404
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,699
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

405
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,286
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.

406
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,374
That's the truth. All the truth.

407
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,715
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?

408
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:39,011
None of us are free.
We are men of the Night's Watch.

409
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:44,976
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon Snow. Go on.

410
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,489
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.

411
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,659
-Yes, you are.
-And I don't trust the bastard.

412
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,620
He told the truth.

413
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,290
And you always know
when a man is telling a lie?

414
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,500
How did you acquire this magical power?

415
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,880
I grew up in King's Landing.

416
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,637
No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.

417
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:28,978
Your grandfather gave me a necklace
just like this one for my 51st nameday.

418
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,940
The wedding is in a fortnight,
Grandmother.

419
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,734
You can't say no to everything.

420
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,069
Nonsense. My little dears.

421
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,448
Go and speak
to the jewelers of King's Landing.

422
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,034
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

423
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,705
The one who brings me the best necklace
will get to keep the next best.

424
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:56,172
The Margaery Tyrell who walks
into the sept a fortnight from now

425
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,633
will inspire 1,000 songs.

426
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,178
Now, how sad it will be
if she's wearing rubbish like that.

427
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,014
Perhaps, I should just let Joffrey
choose it for me.

428
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,934
End up with a string of dead
sparrow heads around my neck.

429
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,103
You watch that. Even here, even with me.

430
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,399
My word.

431
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,780
My lady. My lady.
Please pardon me for interrupting.

432
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,991
-My name is Brienne of Tarth, and I--
-We know who you are.

433
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,994
We've heard all about you.
But hearing is one thing.

434
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,833
Aren't you just marvelous?
Absolutely singular.

435
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,962
I hear you knocked my grandson
into the dirt

436
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,630
like the silly little boy he is.

437
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,634
My lady, I know
this is a very busy time for you,

438
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,761
but if I could just have a moment.

439
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,973
You dare not refuse.

440
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,060
A shadow?

441
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,646
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

442
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,277
I swear to you by all the Gods,
it was Stannis.

443
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,739
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart and disappeared.

444
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,245
-One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.
-Joffrey is our king now.

445
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,999
-I meant no offense.
-And you've given none.

446
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,678
All the Kingsguard will be on duty,
of course.

447
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,388
Ser Boros will be stationed here.

448
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,685
Ser Preston will be stationed here
beside the primary entertainment.

449
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,521
Your Grace?

450
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,693
Yes, yes, one guard at the...
the thing. Go on.

451
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,279
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

452
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,782
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.

453
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,536
-Ever since your absence.
-And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.

454
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,289
All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

455
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,168
The people love their king.
They know who keeps them fed.

456
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,961
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

457
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,964
By my leave.

458
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,301
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

459
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,470
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.

460
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,805
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.

461
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,974
Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

462
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,852
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

463
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,604
Busy getting captured.

464
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,150
So, this is the famous Book of Brothers?

465
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,778
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard?

466
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,326
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.

467
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,955
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

468
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,500
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.

469
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,753
Ser Duncan the Tall.

470
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,507
Four pages for Ser Duncan.

471
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,384
-He must have been quite a man.
-So they say.

472
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,515
Ser Jaime Lannister.

473
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,188
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

474
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,358
-There's still time.
-Is there?

475
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,986
For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?

476
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,073
How can you protect me with that?

477
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,910
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.
Makes for more of a contest.

478
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,513
Have you ever been to Meereen?

479
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,474
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

480
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,270
-And?
-They say 1,000 slaves died

481
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,938
building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

482
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,900
And now an army of former slaves
is marching to her gates.

483
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,531
-You think the Great Masters are worried?
-If they're smart, Your Grace.

484
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,079
You were told
to ride at the back of the train.

485
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,747
Yes, my queen.

486
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,417
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

487
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,794
A matter of strategy.

488
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,842
Your Grace.

489
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,098
All right,
what is this matter of strategy?

490
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,769
A dusk rose.

491
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,647
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

492
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:28,652
-And this one's called lady's lace.
-Would you like to walk without shoes?

493
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,238
You have to know a land to rule it.

494
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,868
Its plants, its rivers,
its roads, its people.

495
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,914
Dusk rose tea eases fever.
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

496
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,832
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

497
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,461
If you want them to follow you,
you have to become a part of their world.

498
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,879
Strategy.

499
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,425
Harpy's Gold.

500
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,262
No tea from this one.
Beautiful but poisonous.

501
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,230
You are a gambler, aren't you?

502
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,364
Your Grace.

503
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,732
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

504
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,777
How many miles
are there between here and Meereen?

505
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,239
163, Your Grace.

506
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,908
I'll tell our men
to ride ahead and bury them.

507
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,953
-You don't need to see this.
-You will do no such thing.

508
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,000
I will see each and every one
of their faces.

509
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,212
Remove her collar before you bury her.

510
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,056
-There she is.
-Yes, there she is.

511
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,477
-And?
-You made a promise.

512
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,356
To return the Stark girls
to their mother, who is now dead.

513
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,566
To keep them safe.

514
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,236
Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen
since her father was killed.

515
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,822
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

516
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,199
There's a certain safety in death,
wouldn't you say?

517
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:44,371
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.
Bit of a complication.

518
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,041
A complication does not release you
from a vow.

519
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,251
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

520
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,879
And take her where?
Where would she be safer than here?

521
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,714
Look me in the eye and tell me

522
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,841
that you think she'll be safe
in King's Landing.

523
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,560
Are you sure we're not related?
Ever since I've returned,

524
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:09,271
every Lannister I've seen
has been a miserable pain in my ass.

525
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,272
Maybe you're a Lannister too.

526
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,192
You've got the hair for it
if not the looks.

527
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,831
It's… it's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

528
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,462
-You're drunk.
-Yes. I have good reason to be.

529
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,508
Once I was a knight
and now, I'm only a fool.

530
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,928
Don't you know me?

531
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,309
Ser Dontos.
The king's nameday celebration.

532
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,603
I'm sorry, I should have remembered.

533
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,856
I can't accept your apology.

534
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,025
I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool,
thanks to you.

535
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,196
-Anyone would have done the same.
-But only you did.

536
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,159
I can never repay you.
You gave me my life.

537
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,372
But this, this is worth more than my life.

538
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,544
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

539
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,798
House Hollard was strong once.
House on the rise.

540
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:05,429
That's all that's left of those days,
thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

541
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,643
I can't take it.
It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.

542
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,562
I don't have anything else left.

543
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,066
That's all. Take it. Wear it.

544
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,777
Let my name have
one more moment in the sun

545
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,613
before it disappears from the world.

546
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,578
I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

547
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,747
Yeah.

548
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,025
When am I going to get
a horse of my own?

549
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,110
The little lady wants a pony.

550
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,197
The little lady wants away
from your stench.

551
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,574
Horses aren't easy to come by.

552
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,245
Even if they were, you think
I'm going to put you on your own horse?

553
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,123
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

554
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,960
Why don't you have any money?

555
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,796
Didn't you steal anything
from Joffrey before you left?

556
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,422
No.

557
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,802
-You're not very smart, are you?
-I'm not a thief.

558
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,389
You're fine with murdering little boys,
but thieving is beneath you?

559
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,143
-A man's got to have a code.
-You think I'm going to escape?

560
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,729
Where would I go?

561
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,150
I'd be dead by nightfall without you.
My family's gone. I've got no one.

562
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,947
You've got an aunt in the Vale.
Your rich Aunt Lysa.

563
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,241
After I sell you to her,

564
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,869
maybe she'll have enough left over
to buy you that pony you want so much.

565
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:01,795
-I'm hungry. You're hungry.
-Five horses, five men.

566
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,299
More than I feel like killing
on an empty stomach.

567
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,352
I know him.
The small one. His name is Polliver.

568
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,730
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.

569
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:26,194
-He killed Lommy.
-What the fuck's a Lommy?

570
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,487
He was my friend.

571
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,408
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

572
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,580
-He's still got it.
-Got what?

573
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,249
My sword, Needle.

574
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,711
Needle? Of course, you named your sword.

575
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,672
-Lots of people name their swords.
-Lots of cunts.

576
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,098
-What are you-- Get back here.
-My brother gave me that sword.

577
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,185
-Get back here.
-He killed my friend.

578
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,855
I don't care if he ate your friend.
We're not going in there.

579
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,819
Come on, give it up, love.

580
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,784
Come here.

581
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,412
-Let's have a bit of a feel.
-Leave it.

582
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,569
Come here.

583
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,991
-Please, she's a good girl.
-Shut your mouth and pour us more ale

584
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,077
and we may not take her with us
when we're done with her.

585
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,500
I know you.

586
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,088
You're the Hound.

587
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,259
Pour our new friend some ale.

588
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,640
What brings you so far north?

589
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,269
I could ask the same of you.
What are you doing up here?

590
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,439
-Just keeping the king's peace.
-No need. The war's over.

591
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,900
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

592
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,154
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.
And where am I for all of it?

593
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,905
Stuck with your brother.

594
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,950
-Meaning no offense.
-None taken.

595
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,953
He's good, the Mountain is.
The best at what he does.

596
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,498
But torture, torture, torture, torture.

597
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,251
You spend enough time
putting the hammer to people,

598
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,754
you start to feel
like a carpenter making chairs.

599
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,758
Drains the fun right out of it.
And what's life without a little fun?

600
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,888
But I don't need to tell you that.

601
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,893
She's all right. I've had better.

602
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:10,025
You know what? You should come with us.

603
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,362
His kind, they've always got something
hidden away somewhere.

604
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,449
Gold, silver, more daughters.

605
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,451
Always something if you know
how to make them talk.

606
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,037
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.

607
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,415
You could do well for yourself.
We certainly have been.

608
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,296
I'm not going to King's Landing.

609
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,049
Think about it.
We could do whatever we like

610
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,133
wherever we go.

611
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,056
These are the king's colors.
No one's standing in his way now.

612
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,099
Which means no one's standing in ours.

613
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,312
Fuck the king.

614
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,950
When I heard that Joffrey's dog
had tucked tail

615
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,203
and run from the Battle of the Blackwater,
I didn't believe it.

616
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,872
-But here you are.
-Here I am.

617
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,000
Bring me one of those chickens.

618
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,586
-You got money to pay for it?
-You paid for it?

619
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,715
No. But we're the king's men.

620
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,804
-So, you got money?
-Not a penny.

621
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,141
-I'll still take that chicken.
-Tell you what.

622
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,310
We'll trade you.

623
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,855
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

624
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,524
Give us a go at your friend.

625
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,903
Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

626
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,370
You're a talker.

627
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,584
Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.

628
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,480
And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.

629
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,284
You don't seem to understand
the situation.

630
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:29,247
I understand that if any more words
come pouring out of your cunt mouth,

631
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,168
I'm going to have to eat
every fucking chicken in this room.

632
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,296
You lived your life for the king.

633
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,507
You're going to die for some chickens?

634
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,469
Someone is.

635
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:45,175
-Something wrong with your leg, boy?
-What? What do you mean?

636
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,428
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

637
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,430
Carry me?

638
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,100
Fine little blade.

639
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,775
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
