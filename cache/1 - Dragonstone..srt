1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,946
You're wondering
why I brought you all here.

2
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,112
After all, we just had a feast.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,408
Since when does old Walder
give us two feasts

4
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,368
in a single fortnight?

5
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,666
Well, it's no good
being Lord of the Riverlands

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,126
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,552
That's what I say.

8
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,896
I've gathered every Frey
who means a thing

9
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:11,145
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house,

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,981
now that winter has come.

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,317
But first, a toast.

12
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,493
No more of
that Dornish horse piss.

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,451
This is the finest Arbor gold.

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,370
Proper wine for proper heroes.

15
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,086
Stand together.

16
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,296
Stand together.

17
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,439
Not you.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,188
I'm not wasting good wine
on a woman.

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,155
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

20
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,612
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

21
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,072
You're my family.

22
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,831
The men who helped me slaughter
the Starks at the Red Wedding.

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,789
Yes. Yes.

24
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,091
Cheer.

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,965
Brave men. All of you.

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,473
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,182
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

28
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:33,398
Slaughtered your guests after
inviting them into your home.

29
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,856
But you didn't slaughter

30
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,612
every one of the Starks.

31
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,069
No, no.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,371
That was your mistake.

33
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,076
You should have ripped
them all out, root and stem.

34
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,591
Leave one wolf alive
and the sheep are never safe.

35
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,699
When people ask you
what happened here,

36
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,244
tell them the North remembers.

37
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,298
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

38
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Episode 1 - Dragonstone.

39
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,391
You wildlings?

40
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

41
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,230
This is Brandon Stark,
son of Ned Stark.

42
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,909
And how do I know that's true?

43
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,449
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

44
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,876
You were at Hardhome.

45
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,754
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

46
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,084
You've seen the Night King.

47
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,594
He's coming for us.

48
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,472
For all of us.

49
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,234
All right, come on.
Let's get them inside.

50
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,549
I want every Northern maester

51
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,885
to scour their records for
any mention of dragonglass.

52
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,721
Dragonglass kills White Walkers,

53
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,398
it's more valuable to us now
than gold.

54
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,021
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

55
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,818
we need to make weapons from it.

56
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,282
Everyone, aged 10 to 60,

57
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,451
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

58
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,121
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

59
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,824
Not just the boys.

60
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,664
We can't defend the North

61
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,620
if only
half the population is fighting.

62
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,376
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

63
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,049
I don't plan on knitting by
the fire while men fight for me.

64
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,550
I might be small, Lord Glover,

65
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,007
and I might be a girl,

66
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,593
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

67
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,678
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one is questioning...

68
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,855
And I don't need your permission
to defend the North.

69
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,109
We'll begin training every man,

70
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,938
woman, boy and girl
on Bear Island.

71
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,782
While we're preparing for attack

72
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,655
we need to shore up
our defences.

73
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,032
The only thing standing
between us

74
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,785
and the Army of the Dead
is the Wall,

75
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,990
and the Wall hasn't been

76
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,996
properly manned in centuries.

77
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,086
I'm not
the king of the free folk.

78
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,090
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

79
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,011
You want us to man
the castles for you?

80
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,679
Aye.

81
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,678
Last time we saw the Night King
was at Hardhome.

82
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,681
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

83
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,353
Then that's where I'll go.

84
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,391
Looks like
we're the Night's Watch now.

85
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,444
If they breach the Wall,

86
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,021
the first two castles
in their path

87
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,528
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

88
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,201
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

89
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,779
Their castles
should be torn down,

90
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,409
with not a stone left standing.

91
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,911
The castles committed no crimes.

92
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,456
And we need
every fortress we have

93
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,707
for the war to come.

94
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,040
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

95
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,296
loyal families who supported us
against Ramsay.

96
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,801
Aye.

97
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,135
The Umbers and the Karstarks

98
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,512
have fought beside the Starks
for centuries.

99
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,095
They've kept faith
for generation after generation.

100
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,600
And then they broke faith.

101
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,477
I'm not going to
strip these families

102
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,774
of their ancestral homes

103
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,227
because of the crimes of
a few reckless sons.

104
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,406
So, there's no punishment for treason
and no reward for loyalty?

105
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,246
The punishment for treason
is death.

106
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,041
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

107
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,165
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

108
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,417
They died fighting for Ramsay.

109
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,499
Give the castles
to the families of the men

110
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,300
who died fighting for you.

111
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,399
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

112
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,229
I executed men who betrayed me.

113
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,366
I executed men
who refused to follow orders.

114
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,444
My father always said,

115
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,995
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

116
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,369
and I have tried to live
by those words.

117
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,954
But I will not punish a son

118
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,536
for his father's sins,

119
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,088
and I will not take
a family home away

120
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,292
from a family it has belonged to
for centuries.

121
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,132
That is my decision,

122
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,555
and my decision is final.

123
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,855
Ned Umber.

124
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,106
Alys Karstark.

125
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,667
For centuries, our families

126
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,840
fought side-by-side
on the battlefield.

127
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:27,304
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

128
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,515
to serve as our Bannerman

129
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,093
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

130
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,946
Stand.

131
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,447
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

132
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,450
The North
needs to band together,

133
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,951
all the living North.

134
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,126
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys?

135
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,703
Now and always?

136
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,210
Now and always.

137
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,526
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

138
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,274
Will you start wearing a crown?

139
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,572
When you question my decisions

140
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,195
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

141
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,072
So, I can't question
your decisions anymore?

142
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,162
Of course you can, but...

143
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,158
Joffrey never let
anyone question his authority.

144
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,205
You think he was a good king?

145
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,577
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

146
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,837
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

147
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,884
Thank you.

148
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,346
You're good at this, you know.

149
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,548
At what?

150
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,803
At ruling.

151
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,554
- No.
- You are. You are.

152
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,225
They respect you,
they really do.

153
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,151
But you have to...

154
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,354
Why are you laughing?

155
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,780
What did Father used to say?

156
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,280
Everything before the word "but"
is horseshit.

157
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,611
He never said that to me.

158
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,321
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

159
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,749
Because he was trying
to protect us.

160
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,833
He never wanted us to see

161
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,456
how dirty the world really is,

162
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,210
but Father couldn't protect me
and neither can you.

163
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,380
Stop trying.

164
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,174
All right, I'll stop trying
to protect you,

165
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,672
and you stop trying to
undermine me.

166
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,469
I'm not trying to undermine you!

167
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,933
You have to be smarter
than Father.

168
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,015
You need to be smarter
than Robb.

169
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,722
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

170
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,899
and they both
lost their heads for it.

171
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,942
And how should I be smarter?

172
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,564
By listening to you?

173
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,863
Would that be so terrible?

174
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,737
A raven from King's Landing,
Your Grace.

175
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,006
Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

176
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,958
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

177
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,463
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

178
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,011
What does she want?

179
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,966
Come to King's Landing,

180
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,643
bend the knee or suffer the fate
of all traitors.

181
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,770
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

182
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,644
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

183
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,191
I'm consumed with the Night King

184
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,813
because I've seen him.

185
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,362
And believe me, you'd think of
little else if you had, too.

186
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,448
We still have a wall between us
and the Night King.

187
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,024
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

188
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,781
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

189
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,871
Winter is here.

190
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,617
The Lannisters are
a Southern army.

191
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,414
They never range this far north.

192
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,289
You're the military man,
but I know her.

193
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,286
If you're her enemy,
she'll never stop

194
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,962
until she's destroyed you.

195
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,962
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

196
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,130
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

197
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,934
I learned a great deal from her.

198
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,348
What is this?

199
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,218
It's what we've been waiting for
our whole lives.

200
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,929
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

201
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,559
He knew it.

202
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,391
Made me memorize
every city, town,

203
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,067
lake, forest and mountain.

204
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,941
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

205
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,983
You've been quiet
since you came home.

206
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,448
- Are you angry with me?
- No, not angry.

207
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,950
Are you afraid of me?

208
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,917
Should I be?

209
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,257
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

210
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,714
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

211
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,716
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

212
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,757
Our little brother,

213
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,968
the one you love so much,

214
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,223
the one you set free,

215
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,227
the one who murdered our father
and our first-born son.

216
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,560
Now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

217
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,400
He's out there somewhere,
at the head of an armada.

218
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,868
Where will they land?

219
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,160
Dragonstone.

220
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,909
They have deep-water ports
for the ships.

221
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,957
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

222
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,254
and that's where she was born.

223
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,547
Enemies to the east.

224
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,458
Enemies to the south.

225
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,340
Ellaria Sand
and her brood

226
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,217
Enemies to the west.

227
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,141
Olenna, the old
Another traitor.

228
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,687
Enemies to the north.

229
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,641
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

230
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,023
and that murdering Sansa,
stands beside him.

231
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,274
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

232
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,106
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

233
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,658
- How do we proceed?
- Winter's here.

234
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,453
We can't win a war

235
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,574
if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

236
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,579
The Tyrells have the grain.
The Tyrells have the livestock.

237
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,333
Will the Tyrell Bannerman stand
alongside a Dothraki horde

238
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,958
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

239
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,507
If they think Daenerys will win.

240
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,550
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

241
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,755
Right now,
we look like the losing side.

242
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,677
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

243
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,226
Three kingdoms, at best.

244
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,434
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

245
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,186
I understand
we're in a war for survival.

246
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,232
I understand
whoever loses, dies.

247
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,402
I understand whoever wins

248
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,650
could launch a dynasty
that lasts a thousand years.

249
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,447
A dynasty for whom?

250
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,743
Our children are dead.

251
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,695
We're the last of us.

252
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,830
A dynasty for us, then.

253
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,668
We never talked about Tommen.

254
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,544
There's nothing to say.

255
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,375
Our baby boy killed himself.

256
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,085
He betrayed me.

257
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,590
He betrayed us both.

258
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,388
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead,

259
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,261
Mother, Father,
and all our children?

260
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,343
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

261
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,553
But they're ashes now,

262
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,933
and we're still flesh and blood.

263
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,936
We're the last Lannisters.
The last ones who count.

264
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,983
Even Lannisters can't survive
without allies.

265
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,068
Where are our allies now?

266
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,788
You saw what happened
to Walder Frey and his family.

267
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,081
I heard.

268
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,957
How could we ever trust
a man like that?

269
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,626
We couldn't.
He was a useless old coward.

270
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,705
But the Freys supported us.

271
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,923
Now they're all dead.

272
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,624
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

273
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,084
We need allies.

274
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,967
Stronger, better allies.
We can't win this war alone.

275
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,221
Do you think I listened
to Father for 40 years

276
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,052
and learned nothing?

277
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,090
The Greyjoys...

278
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,847
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

279
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:53,973
Not all of them.

280
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,929
Well, it looks like all of them.

281
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,264
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

282
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,691
the new
King of the Iron Islands.

283
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,440
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

284
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,899
There you are.

285
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,446
How are they better allies?

286
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,866
How are they
different from the Freys?

287
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,284
They both broke their promises

288
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,656
and murdered
their former friends

289
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,786
as soon as it suited them.

290
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,785
So does everyone,
when it suits them.

291
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,992
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

292
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,206
And they're good at killing.

293
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,254
They're not good at anything.
I know the Ironborn.

294
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,332
They're bitter,
angry little people.

295
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,633
All they know how to do
is steal things they can't build

296
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,719
or grow themselves.

297
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,758
Euron Greyjoy
didn't come here for that.

298
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,555
Oh, what did he come here for then?

299
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,765
A queen.

300
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,357
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

301
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,817
they turned on me.

302
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,992
Their own uncle.

303
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,571
They stole my best ships
and ran.

304
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,990
Sailed them
right across the world

305
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,825
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

306
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,535
so she could bring her armies

307
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,586
here to attack you.

308
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,799
It's nothing
compared to the treason

309
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,298
you suffered
at the hands of a family member,

310
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,719
from what I hear.

311
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,388
But still, it bothers me.

312
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,885
Murdering them
would make me feel a lot better.

313
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,439
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

314
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,141
are fighting for the same side,

315
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,067
I thought we rightful monarchs
could murder them together.

316
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,114
You're not a rightful monarch,
though, are you?

317
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,161
The Greyjoys
rebelled against the throne

318
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,621
for the right to be monarchs.

319
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,049
But as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

320
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,256
Come to mention it,

321
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,588
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

322
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,345
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

323
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,305
You certainly caught us there.

324
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,012
Very smart move on your part.

325
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,021
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

326
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,569
I was there.

327
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,441
I remember very well.

328
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,896
I saw you.

329
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,777
I heard so much talk.

330
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,152
"The best in the world.
No one can stop him."

331
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,700
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

332
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,916
But I must say, when you rushed
through the breach

333
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,288
and started cutting people down,

334
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,081
it was glorious.

335
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,708
Like a dance.

336
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,878
The people I was cutting down
were your own kin.

337
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,845
The place was getting crowded.

338
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,883
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

339
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,934
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

340
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,103
A good thing for me.

341
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,058
If you hadn't crushed us,
I wouldn't have gone into exile.

342
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,855
And if I hadn't done that,

343
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,647
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain in the 14 seas.

344
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,357
If not the most humble.

345
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,819
You're not humble.

346
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,826
You're the queen
of a great nation.

347
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,749
You don't care
about the Iron Islands.

348
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,669
They're nothing but rocks

349
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,621
and bird and...

350
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,254
And a lot of
very unattractive people.

351
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,922
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

352
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,763
that's something else entirely.

353
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,342
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

354
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,219
With the Iron Fleet,

355
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,053
you own the seas.

356
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,561
You can defeat
the invaders in the East

357
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,858
and the pretenders
in the North and South.

358
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,274
What do you want in return?

359
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,775
Ever since I was a little boy,

360
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,281
I wanted to grow up and marry

361
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,321
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

362
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,831
So, here I am,

363
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,459
with a thousand ships

364
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,207
and two good hands.

365
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,213
I decline your proposal.

366
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,717
Why?

367
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,927
You're not trustworthy.

368
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,139
You've broken
promises to allies before

369
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,266
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

370
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,855
You murdered your own brother.

371
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,438
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

372
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,443
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

373
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,740
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

374
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,112
In my experience,

375
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,037
the surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

376
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,163
A priceless gift.

377
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,165
I won't return to King's Landing

378
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,868
until I have that for you.

379
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,522
Ah, Maester Weyland.

380
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,606
A drinker's liver
if ever I saw one.

381
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,899
Weigh that.

382
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,362
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

383
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,364
Mankind's curse.

384
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,162
Archmaester,
I was wondering...

385
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,036
- What's the weight?
- Um...

386
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,035
A hundred and forty-seven.

387
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,132
I was wondering if
you'd considered my proposition.

388
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,010
I don't remember
your proposition.

389
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,678
I asked you if,

390
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,676
in light of what
I'd seen in the North,

391
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,759
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

392
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,515
That area is reserved
for maesters.

393
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,017
- Are you a maester?
- No.

394
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,895
Not a very strong proposition,
is it?

395
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,694
Archmaester, with respect,

396
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,664
I've seen them.
The Army of the Dead.

397
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,079
The White Walkers.

398
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,458
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

399
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,834
but everyone in the Citadel,

400
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,836
those who'll even talk to me,

401
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,543
they all doubt the Walkers
ever existed in the first place.

402
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,137
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

403
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,223
It's their job.

404
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,098
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

405
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,690
Too many similarities from
unconnected sources.

406
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,443
Sources in the restricted area?

407
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,023
The very same.

408
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,407
And the simplest explanation
for your grating obsession

409
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,160
with the White Walkers is that
you're telling the truth,

410
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,791
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

411
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,295
So, you believe me.

412
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,667
I do.

413
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,875
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

414
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,887
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

415
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,806
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

416
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,058
And we're not like the people
north of the Twins.

417
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,726
In the Citadel,
we lead different lives

418
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,402
for different reasons.

419
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,906
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

420
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,905
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

421
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,112
Don't remember any meal
but the last.

422
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,243
Can't see forward to any
but the next.

423
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,917
And every time you leave
the house and shut the door,

424
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,538
they howl
like you're gone forever.

425
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,460
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

426
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,632
people thought the end was near.

427
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,380
The end
of the Targaryen dynasty.

428
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,677
"How will we survive?"

429
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,097
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward,

430
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,140
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush.

431
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,181
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

432
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,309
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

433
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,561
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

434
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,608
But it wasn't. None of it was.

435
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,489
The Wall has stood
through it all.

436
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,451
And every winter that ever came
has ended.

437
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,912
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

438
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,513
No.

439
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,524
No.

440
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,664
You're a lucky man.

441
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,665
I've heard she beat
the Hound in single combat.

442
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,336
She's a very impressive woman.

443
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,056
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

444
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,311
I want you to be happy.

445
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,814
I want you to be safe.

446
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,061
I am safe.

447
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,019
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

448
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,648
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

449
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,286
What about happy?

450
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,324
Why aren't you happy?

451
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,743
What do you want
that you do not have?

452
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,337
At the moment, peace and quiet.

453
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,008
No need to seize the last word,
Lord Baelish.

454
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,181
I'll assume
it was something clever.

455
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,893
My lady.

456
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,937
My lady.

457
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,777
Why is he still here?

458
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,910
We need his men.

459
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,032
Without the Vale,

460
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,114
Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

461
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,749
Littlefinger saved us.

462
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,168
He wants something.

463
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,088
I know exactly what he wants.

464
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,893
He rode through
the streets of the city

465
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,813
Down from his hill on high

466
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,313
O'er the wynds
and the steps and the cobbles

467
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,021
He rode to a woman's sigh

468
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,198
For she was his secret treasure

469
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,618
She was his shame and his bliss

470
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,321
And a chain and a keep
are nothing

471
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,249
Compared to a woman's kiss

472
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,624
For hands of gold
are always cold

473
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,335
But a woman's hands are warm

474
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,381
For hands of gold
are always cold

475
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,757
But a woman's hands are...

476
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,974
That's a pretty song.
I've never heard it before.

477
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,593
It's a new one.

478
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,644
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

479
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,063
I don't want to steal your food.

480
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,357
You're not stealing.
We're offering.

481
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,526
Come on,
it's gonna be a cold night.

482
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,510
You heading south?

483
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,966
King's Landing.

484
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,635
Poor girl.

485
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,554
It's not so bad, is it?

486
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,523
Depends on your taste, I guess.

487
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,976
If you like your streets
covered in and pig's blood,

488
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,777
it's the town for you.

489
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,856
All my life I wanted to see
the Red Keep,

490
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,906
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

491
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,946
Then when I finally make it,

492
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,119
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

493
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,197
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

494
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,283
and the Dragonpit
is a ruin.

495
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,663
The people who live there,
they'd skin you alive

496
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,541
if they could make two coppers
off your hide.

497
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,667
Worst place in the world.

498
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,045
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

499
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,546
There's been some trouble

500
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,298
with the Freys up at the Twins.

501
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,595
So, we're part of the army

502
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,092
that's been sent to
keep the peace.

503
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,218
Here you go.

504
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,928
Guests first.

505
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,184
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

506
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,394
Well, my mother always told me
to be kind to strangers

507
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,397
and strangers will be
kind to you.

508
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,289
You're a long way from home.

509
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,163
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

510
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,374
Yeah, endless adventures.

511
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,711
They'll be singing
about us for a thousand years.

512
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,135
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

513
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,678
And now that
we've been gone a while,

514
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,845
we can't wait to get home.

515
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,675
I just think about my dad
out there on his boat all alone.

516
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,093
I ought to be
out there with him.

517
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,889
My wife just had our first baby.

518
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,143
Boy or girl?

519
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,315
Oh, who knows?

520
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,518
You think soldiers get ravens
with news from home?

521
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,440
I hope it's a girl.

522
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,070
Why?

523
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,903
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

524
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,988
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

525
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,412
Are you old enough to drink?

526
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,928
It's blackberry wine.
I made it myself.

527
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,684
It's really good.

528
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,144
So, why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

529
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,448
I'm going to kill the queen.

530
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,889
Bad night to be outdoors.

531
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,979
You've got real powerful magic
to figure that out.

532
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,268
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

533
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,693
"It's snowing, Thoros."

534
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,613
"It's windy.
It's gonna be a cold night."

535
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,989
You're a grouchy
old bear, aren't you, Clegane?

536
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,286
You want some rum?

537
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,743
Don't like that
It's too sweet.

538
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,826
Why you always
in such a foul mood?

539
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,374
Experience.

540
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,507
This seems like a good place
to spend the night.

541
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,466
These people don't want us here.

542
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,142
Seems deserted to me.

543
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,469
No livestock.

544
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,520
No smoke
coming from the chimney.

545
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,287
I don't like the look of it.

546
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,454
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

547
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,130
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me.

548
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,166
Bald cocksuckers like you.

549
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,843
You think you're fooling anyone
with that top knot?

550
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,800
Bald

551
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,011
Come on.

552
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,184
Maybe they got some ale
hidden away.

553
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,221
They don't.

554
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,437
See if there's a larder.

555
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,728
They always
leave something behind.

556
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,604
How do you think
it ended for them?

557
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,322
With death.

558
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,901
Girl died in her father's arms.

559
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,159
Both of them covered in blood,
and a knife at their feet.

560
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,374
I'd say they were starving.

561
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,251
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

562
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,079
he ended it for both of them.

563
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,962
- Doesn't matter now.
- No.

564
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,001
Doesn't matter now.

565
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,809
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

566
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,817
Aye. I think
the first time we met

567
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,068
was at that tournament.

568
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,071
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

569
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,241
You're not bad.

570
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,742
I don't hate you.

571
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,040
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

572
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,244
Thank you, Clegane.
That warms the heart.

573
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,830
But there's nothing special
about you.

574
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,790
You're right about that.

575
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,002
So, why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

576
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,596
I've met better men than you,

577
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,596
and they've been hanged
from crossbeams or beheaded

578
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,227
or just shat themselves to death
in a field somewhere.

579
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,475
None of them came back.

580
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,987
So, why you?

581
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,072
You think
I don't ask myself that?

582
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,869
Every hour of every day?
Why am I here?

583
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,993
What am I supposed to do?

584
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,824
What does the Lord see in me?

585
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,127
And?

586
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,206
I don't know.

587
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,132
I don't understand our Lord.

588
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,885
Your Lord.

589
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,087
I don't know
what he wants from me.

590
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,923
I only know that

591
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,592
he wants me alive.

592
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,385
If he's so all-powerful,

593
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,937
why doesn't he just tell you
what he wants?

594
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,102
Clegane. Come over here.

595
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,527
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

596
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,658
I want to show you something.

597
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,034
It's my luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

598
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,869
Aye. Almost seems like
divine justice.

599
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,329
There's no divine justice,
you dumb

600
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,335
If there was, you'd be dead.

601
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,717
And that girl would be alive.

602
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,592
What do you want?

603
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,805
Look into the flames.

604
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,104
I don't want to look
in the flames.

605
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,272
You saw me bring him back
from the dead

606
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,350
after you cut him down.

607
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,395
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

608
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:03,152
I keep asking,
and no one wants to tell me.

609
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,576
We can't tell you.
Only the fire can tell you.

610
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,707
What do you see?

611
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,879
- Logs burning.
- Keep looking.

612
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,053
What do you see?

613
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,025
Ice.

614
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,733
A wall of ice.

615
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,237
The Wall.

616
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,283
What else?

617
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,462
It's where
the Wall meets the sea.

618
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,712
There's a castle there.

619
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:13,557
There's a mountain.
Looks like an arrowhead.

620
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,145
The dead are marching past.

621
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,863
Thousands of them.

622
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,538
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

623
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,246
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

624
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,408
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

625
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,790
Burying the dead.

626
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,461
You knew these people.

627
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,972
Not really.

628
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,619
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

629
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,497
We ask the Mother to...

630
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,537
I don't remember the rest.

631
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,719
I'm sorry you're dead.

632
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,843
You deserved better.

633
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,928
Both of you.

634
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,296
Mom.

635
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,712
You should really sleep, Sam.

636
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,802
The dead don't.

637
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,857
"Legends of the Long Night."

638
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,188
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons,

639
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,694
without even knowing
what the First Men used it for.

640
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,003
What is it?

641
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,799
It's a map of Dragonstone.

642
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,089
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

643
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,970
when they invaded Westeros.

644
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,140
That's dragonglass.

645
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,224
A mountain of it.
Beneath the ground.

646
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,525
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

647
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,564
This is important.

648
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,112
Jon needs to know.

649
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,665
- Has she come yet?
- Who?

650
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,124
The Dragon Queen.
Daenerys Stormborn.

651
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,130
Haven't heard anything.

652
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,513
Shall we begin?
