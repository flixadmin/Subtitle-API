1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,360
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,450
- I start a new job in the morning.
- A new job? Congratulations.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,082
I'm coming to work at the G.C.P.D.
I'm your new medical examiner.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,647
I have questions I need
to ask members of the board.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,649
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,522
It seems likely those gangsters were given
shares in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,004
This nightclub makes a lot of money. That's
why I wanna reopen it under your care.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,925
- I can have the club?
- You're with me now.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,650
What is this place? Where are we?

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,320
Some people think it's a prison.
Some think it's hell.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,960
They took my eyes.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,851
- People call him Mace.
- And he's the one in charge.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,720
Ah!

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,566
My name is Fish Mooney. I'm in charge now.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,488
Yes, that's on. Heh.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,844
<i>When</i> you're smiling

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,650
<i>When you're smiling</i>

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>The whole world smiles with you</i>

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,851
<i>When you're laughing</i>

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,128
What's she doing?

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,169
<i>When you're laughing</i>

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,129
<i>That sun</i>

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,886
<i>Comes shining through</i>

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,408
<i>But when you're crying...</i>

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,601
We have one more step. We're next.

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,404
Jim.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,606
Hi.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,087
Where's Jim?

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,327
He dropped off his keys, like, last week.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,643
So screw him anyway, right?

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,211
So who are you guys?

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,566
Thanks.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,129
Ladies and gentlemen, The Flying Graysons.

34
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,368
Show them your appreciation.

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,761
Thank you, from the Flying Graysons.

36
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,161
Thank you. Thank you.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,484
What are you doing?

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,650
Coming through.

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,130
Get back in there. What the...?

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,442
Calm down. Stop that!

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,240
Come on!

42
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,445
Stop it. Calm down.

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,166
I hate you!

44
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,691
Everybody freeze.

45
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,081
That <i>whole world</i>

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,006
<i>Smiles with you</i>

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,166
MWah!

48
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,125
Boo!

49
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,647
Get off, you old bag.

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,131
Beautiful.

51
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,084
Why did you attack Mr. Grayson?

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,004
No reason.

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,562
I don't like him.

54
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,245
I have no idea why he did it.

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,841
Beats me.

56
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,569
You circus people don't mess around,
do you?

57
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,247
John Grayson, if you give me that look
one more time, I will slap you silly.

58
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,243
- You wish.
- Don't think I can't.

59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,483
Whoa, kids.
What's the big problem, anyhow?

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,041
The Graysons are arrogant buttheads
is the problem.

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,965
The Lloyds are feckless drunkards
is more like it.

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,724
So it's a family feud.

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,242
Graysons don't get along with Lloyds.
Been that way for years.

64
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,290
- It's sort of a tradition.
- You guys fight like this every night?

65
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,240
No. That was just her idiot uncle
doing his thing.

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,131
You know damn well it must be Lila's fault.

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,725
- Mary.
- What?

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,404
<i>Hey-</i>

69
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,441
- Sorry the date went south.
- Are you kidding?

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,967
Best date ever.
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

71
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,608
True. None of them will talk, of course.

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,331
I still have no idea
what those two were fighting over.

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,485
I think they're rival lovers. Their
families have been fighting since way back.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,167
But this particular fight was apparently
over a woman named Lila.

75
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,800
She's a snake dancer in the sideshow.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,004
- Wow.
- I know. How cool is that? A snake dancer.

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,164
- No, I mean, wow, you're really good.
- People talk to doctors.

78
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,847
I guess so. I should find this woman Lila.
Make sure she's okay.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,321
Might take a little while.
A patrolman will drive you home.

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,327
- Oh. I could come with you.
- Lee, this is police business.

81
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,125
Come on, Jim. I'm dying to meet Lila. Heh.

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,970
Well, bringing along medical personnel
is a justifiable precaution, I guess.

83
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,088
There you go. Heh.

84
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,170
Sir.

85
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,841
- Where's Lila?
- Lila?

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,931
Snake dancer.

87
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,922
G.C.P.D. We need to speak with Lila.

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,923
She's not here.

89
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,684
Why? What's happened?

90
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,966
Where is she?

91
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,368
Uh, I don't know.

92
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,246
- She was supposed to be home ages ago.
- You a relative?

93
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,283
- I'm her son, Jerome.
- Jerome, when did you last see her?

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,049
This morning.
She was here when I left for the library.

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,086
Relax, Jerome. This gentleman is just here
because Owen and Al had a disagreement.

96
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,560
Your mother's fine. Gone on a spree,
no doubt. You know how she is.

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,691
A spree? Without her hat?
Her coat? Her purse?

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,688
Look at Sheba.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,367
She's distraught.
She knows somethings wrong.

100
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,320
- The snake does seem to be agitated.
- Sir, heh...

101
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,209
she's what you call a party girl.

102
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,049
Back in the morning with her knickers
in a handbag. Sure as eggs.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,931
But she didn't take her handbag, did she?

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,730
How fast does an animal like that move?

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,449
Uh, fast walking pace.
They rely on surprise, mainly.

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,045
Let her out.

107
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,604
- I'm sorry?
- Let her out.

108
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,325
Oh!

109
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,366
Oh, my God.

110
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
You knew.

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,521
- You knew she was here.
- No.

112
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,086
Look at me.

113
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,328
She was like that when we found her.

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,207
Let's talk straight.

115
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,527
Those people out there are using us
as transplant donors.

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,127
We are simply spare parts.

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,048
Unless...

118
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,931
Unless we do something about it.

119
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,044
How?

120
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,969
I have a plan.
But you must do exactly what I say.

121
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,728
You do as I say and I promise you,
I will get some of us out of here alive.

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,604
That's right. No, you heard me correctly.

123
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,242
I said some of us.

124
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,886
Because the truth of the matter is,
some will die.

125
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,288
But we will die with dignity.

126
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,486
We will die for a reason.
And we will die next to family.

127
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,085
And I tell you what...

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,163
we are family.

129
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,448
We are all we got.

130
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,405
That's family.

131
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,402
We have one simple choice.

132
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,683
We die here alone on our knees...

133
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,164
or we stand up
and we fight with our family!

134
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,648
Yeah!

135
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,886
A couple of riggers found her right here.

136
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,651
We decided to hide her on the truck.

137
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,441
We were going to give her a proper burial
as soon as we got back on the road.

138
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,969
- Decent of you. Who's "we"? Who knew?
- Just me and the head of the families.

139
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,120
If an outsider killed her, what can you do?
An act of God?

140
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,008
If it was one of us, we always find out.

141
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,128
And we make sure they're punished.

142
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,490
- How?
- We have our ways.

143
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,563
And we have ours.

144
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,688
Hook him up.

145
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,602
Morning, partner.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,924
- Gonna need a little help here.
- No kidding.

147
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,165
I mean, you're kidding, right?
This isn't an elaborate prank or...?

148
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,761
Yeah.

149
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,729
Tell me about your mother, Jerome.

150
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,322
She's my mother.

151
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,047
What can I say? I love her.

152
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,645
She's perfect.

153
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
Not a very good cook. Heh. Except for that.

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,890
Did she have any enemies?
Someone with a grudge?

155
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,569
No.

156
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
- Boyfriends?
- No.

157
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,850
No?

158
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,604
She had lovers. Sex partners, really.
But not boyfriends.

159
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,406
- She didn't want the commitment.
- Alphonse Grayson?

160
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,211
- Yes, he was one of them.
- Owen Lloyd?

161
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,885
Yes.

162
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,966
- Any others?
- Uh, not that I could put a name to.

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,731
How did you feel
about your mother's love life?

164
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,481
I feel fine about it.

165
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,248
If not for my mother's love life,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

166
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,210
Sex is a healthy, human activity.

167
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,247
Yes, it is.

168
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,930
Do you have any other family?

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,807
The circus is my family.

170
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,121
One more time.
Why did you assault Mr. Grayson?

171
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,964
- You know why.
- Tell me.

172
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,248
- He killed Lila.
- Why would he do that?

173
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,768
She was gonna choose me over him.
And he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

174
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,083
Not gonna let a Lloyd humiliate
a Grayson that way.

175
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,083
How come your families don't get along?

176
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,610
His great grandfather falsely accused my
mother's Uncle Barry of stealing a horse.

177
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,842
- When was this?
- Before the Great War.

178
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,642
- World War I?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,767
For three generations, your families have
been feuding over a stolen horse?

180
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,651
Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.
Blood is blood.

181
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,131
Must be a hell of a horse.

182
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,285
Why did Mr. Lloyd assault you?

183
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,807
He killed Lila
and fears I'm gonna kill him for it.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,890
He says the opposite.
He says you killed her.

185
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,964
Yes, I supposed he would have to say that,
wouldn't he?

186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,044
It wasn't Uncle Owen.
He could never do such a terrible thing.

187
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,806
Holy crap, Mary. How can you be so blind?

188
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,601
- Quiet, you.
- Yeah, quiet, you. You're the blind one.

189
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,128
My brother's a man of honor.
Your uncle's a violent drunk. Do the math.

190
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
My uncle is an artist.

191
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,810
Your brother is a conceited muscle-head
like the rest of you flying douche bags.

192
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,407
- I can't believe I ever thought I loved you.
- Enough. Huh?

193
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,527
They're coming. Are you ready?

194
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,682
Yeah.

195
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,010
- I said, are you ready?
- Yeah!

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,162
MA57A, raise your hand.

197
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,848
Five-seven-A...

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,685
raise your hand.

199
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,885
Step forward.

200
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,844
One moment please, sir.

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,366
We need to talk.

202
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,288
Back up, inmate. You're in violation.

203
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,602
Fifty-seven-A, step forward.

204
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,406
Excuse me. One moment, please.

205
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,087
I'm the new "shot-caller" here.
My name is Fish Mooney.

206
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,208
And with all due respect, for you and I
to have a good working relationship...

207
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,488
there are some things
that need to change.

208
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,847
- Is that right?
- What's your name?

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,446
None of your damn business
what my name is.

210
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,851
Right. Okay.
Well, I know you have a job to do.

211
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,769
And I am more than willing to give you 57A
in exchange for...

212
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,643
6O crates of water, 30 blankets, 50
pounds of fresh fruit and a few magazines.

213
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,164
What if I refuse?

214
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,164
What will you do?

215
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,531
Well, I'd be willing to give you 57A,
just not alive.

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,330
- We need them alive.
- Exactly.

217
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,084
I'm gonna count to three.

218
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,241
You'll disappear or get a severe beating.

219
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,284
I'm gonna take that as a no.

220
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,323
One...

221
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,811
Two...

222
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,606
It's simple economics.

223
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,604
Our lives are worth something.

224
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,249
Sixty crates of water, 3O blankets...

225
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,970
You...

226
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,441
you're coming with me.

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,649
The manager is gonna be
very unhappy with you.

228
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,320
I would think this manager
wouldn't be too happy with you either.

229
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,290
So if he wants to talk to
me, I'll be right here.

230
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,807
The manager doesn't come down here.

231
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,320
Well, looks like we have a standoff.

232
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,444
I tell you what.

233
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,003
I can be flexible.
So I'll go talk to this manager...

234
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,008
but while I'm gone, you're going to stay
right here as our guest. How's that sound?

235
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,562
We'll be back.

236
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,046
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

237
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,330
Yeah.

238
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,768
Wait. Back up a little.

239
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,884
- So you set the snake loose?
- Yes, ma'am.

240
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,247
- To track down the body?
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,529
- Snakes have an excellent sense of smell.
- Well, now I know.

242
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,763
And your prime suspects are a clown
and an acrobat?

243
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,566
- Yeah.
- Ain't this one a doozy?

244
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,522
Your victim, Lila Valeska,
was killed by a large knife or hatchet.

245
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,924
- Multiple blows to the head and upper torso.
- Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

246
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,846
From 2:30 to 4:15, both Grayson and Lloyd
were in the ring for the matinee.

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,482
- Well, how precise is that time of death?
- Give or take 45 minutes.

248
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,362
Still possible then, but cutting it close.

249
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,610
Hold and press your guys, but keep looking.

250
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,081
Yeah, boss.
Forensics is working the crime scene.

251
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,242
We're going through her phone records.

252
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,049
All right.

253
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,442
We're gonna send
the rest of you home now.

254
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,810
But the investigation is ongoing.
Nobody leaves town.

255
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,485
And listen up.

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,045
No more fighting.

257
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,041
Look where your friends are.

258
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,367
What good is this feud doing you?

259
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,604
I like it when you act all tough.

260
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,645
"Nobody leave town."

261
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,484
Sounds better when you say it.

262
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,565
I feel like we should finish up our date.

263
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,485
Do you wanna come over tonight?
I can cook you dinner.

264
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,210
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Good.

265
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,451
- Get some rest.
- I will try. See you later.

266
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,722
I have to ask.

267
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,281
If you were to guess,
who do you think killed Lila?

268
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,121
I try not to guess. I work the
suspects and I wait on forensics.

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,365
Excuse me.

270
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,607
Am I speaking to Detective James Gordon?

271
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,289
Yes.

272
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,008
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

273
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,689
I'm sorry, how did you know who we were?

274
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,882
My name is Paul Cicero.
I'm a psychic with the sideshow.

275
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,725
Lila Valeska was an old friend of mine.

276
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,641
A psychic. I see.
How can I help you, Mr. Cicero?

277
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,647
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

278
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,131
You must be psychic.

279
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,447
In which case, perhaps you'd like to hear
the message Lila sent from the other side.

280
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Thanks, Mr. Cicero. We're not quite
looking at the other side just yet.

281
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,166
As you wish. I'm merely a messenger.

282
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,368
What's the message?

283
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,680
Thank you, doctor.

284
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,208
Lila told me that the
servant of the devil...

285
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,728
lies in the garden of the iron sisters.

286
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,010
The iron sisters? What does that mean?

287
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,447
- I don't know.
- We'll get right on it.

288
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,604
I don't think sarcasm is your métier,
James.

289
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,048
Make of the message what you will.
Good day to you both.

290
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,408
Well, that wasn't very open-minded of you.

291
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,368
Oh, come on, Lee. He's a fraud.

292
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,444
He's gonna go to the press
and say he's consulting on the case.

293
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,728
- He's looking for publicity.
- Maybe.

294
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,686
If you were gonna send a message
from beyond the grave...

295
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,561
don't you think priority number one
would be the killer's name, not a riddle?

296
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,085
Who knows how it works?

297
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,883
- All right. I'm not gonna argue with you.
- Good.

298
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,322
Later then.

299
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,486
Later.

300
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,082
They called to confirm.

301
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,608
You're meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

302
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,083
Excellent.

303
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,410
- I was afraid they'd postpone again.
- Well, I'll say it one more time. I think that...

304
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,564
it's an incredibly
bad idea, Master Bruce.

305
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,521
I think it's reckless. I think it's premature.
Quite frankly, I think it's bloody dangerous.

306
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,524
We've already been over this
a hundred times, Alfred.

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,606
My mind is made up.

308
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,804
Can you pass me that file over there?

309
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,450
File.

310
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,366
Well...

311
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,927
I've said my piece.

312
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,407
If we're both found dead in a ditch,
don't blame me.

313
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,520
Ta-da.

314
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,926
Nah.

315
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,570
No?

316
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,291
Jim loves me in this color.

317
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,922
It's too obvious.
You gotta dress like you're not trying.

318
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,169
Like you're on your way
to go meet some other guy.

319
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,890
To go...

320
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,560
sailing, or whatever.

321
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,843
Really? Sailing?

322
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,321
AlrightY-

323
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,645
- Heh.
- Hm.

324
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,801
Oh, my God.

325
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,089
- Heh. You like?
- Oh, my God.

326
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,521
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

327
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,207
No, it's good. It's my sister's recipe.
She's a really brilliant cook.

328
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,967
I was thinking of my sister
and it came to me.

329
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,800
I think I know
what the blind-man's message means.

330
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,129
"The servant of the devil lies
in the garden of the iron sisters."

331
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,285
It's Arkham Bridge.
The iron sisters. Arkham Bridge.

332
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,966
The towers are called, uh, Mary and Betty.

333
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,124
Mm. I remember
as a kid we used to call them that.

334
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,002
Right. And there's park, um,
under the towers on the Gotham side.

335
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,162
A garden? It all fits.

336
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,331
Lee, it fits an impossible story.

337
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,768
- He didn't speak with Lila. She's dead.
- So you say.

338
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,844
- You're a doctor. A scientist.
- There are things in the world...

339
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,971
that can't be explained by science.
- People who like folk dancing, for instance.

340
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,323
- Doesn't mean ghosts exists.
- You're very arrogant in your certainty.

341
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,329
What if this is a clue to a murder?
The poor woman.

342
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,242
Fine. I'll go myself.

343
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,485
- Thank you.
- Sure.

344
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,843
<i>- I'll</i> come with you.
- We'll go. First thing in the morning.

345
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,843
The morning?

346
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,526
Now? You wanna go now?

347
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,686
- It's only a half a mile away.
- It's dark.

348
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,251
I have a flashlight.

349
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,727
So, what are we
looking for exactly, do you think?

350
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,963
I know. I know.
This is probably a complete waste of time.

351
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,208
- Thank you for doing this.
- Not a problem.

352
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,210
But, uh, let's not make a habit out of it,
okay? This is no place for a lady.

353
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,525
Ha!

354
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,570
- What do you mean, "ha"?
- You're a hypocrite.

355
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,731
You say you want a strong woman
to share this crazy life you've chosen...

356
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,204
but when push comes to shove, you want
me to stay home and bake cookies.

357
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,006
Not cookies, necessarily.

358
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,969
Pie. Any kind of pie.

359
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,360
Ha-ha.

360
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,605
So if someone threw something from a car
on the bridge, this is where it would land.

361
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

362
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,123
Lee.

363
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,610
- What does that mean?
- The Hellfire Club.

364
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,530
It's a Satanist cult that committed
a string of ritual murders.

365
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,324
They haven't been active
for a decade or more.

366
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,289
I guess they're back.

367
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,604
No.

368
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,922
No, I don't think so.

369
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,890
Hey, sarge. I'm gonna need a couple mobile
units to pick some people up, but listen...

370
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,488
they need careful handling.

371
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,882
- Sir, they're in three and four.
- Thanks, Zeke.

372
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,771
- Neither knows the other one's here, right?
- Right, like you said.

373
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,445
Good work.

374
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,322
- Bear in mind you could be wrong about...
- Bear it in mind, I will. But I'm not wrong.

375
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,327
- So go on home now, lady.
- Hey.

376
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,687
We were having a perfectly lovely evening.

377
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,608
I am not the one who wanted
to go out searching for Satanist hatchets.

378
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,364
You know what I wanted to do.

379
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,490
- You're right.
- I'm sorry, what?

380
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,120
I tend to get enthusiastic about things.
It's an issue for me. My mom always said...

381
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,366
Who gives a crap what my mom said, right?

382
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,690
Have a good night, Jim.
Let me know how it all turns out.

383
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,330
Good night, Lee.

384
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,850
Wait.

385
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,849
What you said earlier about hypocrisy,
sharing lives...

386
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,090
you're right. Let's go.

387
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,003
I'm what?

388
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,325
You're right.

389
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,928
Good evening, Mr. Cicero.
Sorry to bring you down here so late.

390
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,051
Good evening, Detective Gordon.

391
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,885
Dr. Thompkins.

392
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,123
- How did you...?
- He smells your perfume.

393
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,403
- We solved the message Lila sent you.
- Oh?

394
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,767
Took us to Arkham Bridge Park.

395
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,287
We found a hatchet there.

396
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,090
- With Satanist symbols scratched into it.
- Dear Lord.

397
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,005
- Know what that hatchet means, Mr. Cicero?
- Tell me.

398
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,361
- It means you're an accessory to murder.
- I merely passed along a message.

399
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,251
A message from the dead. Didn't happen.

400
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,611
Which means you invented the message.

401
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,810
Which means you had someone plant
the hatchet for us to find.

402
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,801
You wanted us to think Satanists
were responsible for Lila's death.

403
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,731
You're protecting somebody.

404
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,011
Lila spoke to me. That's all.

405
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,210
No. The hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

406
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,570
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

407
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,971
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

408
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,609
Someone you love.

409
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,250
This fantasia was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

410
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,405
If you could only see what I see.

411
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,326
Hi, Jerome. Please, take a seat.

412
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,045
You know Mr. Cicero from the show.

413
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,486
Yes, sir.

414
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,408
- Hello, Mr. Cicero.
- Good evening, Jerome.

415
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,322
- Do you know why you're here?
- Did you find out who killed my mother?

416
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,970
You killed your mother, Jerome.

417
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,041
Me?

418
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,921
You killed her up on that hill and Mr.
Cicero let you clean up in his trailer.

419
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,002
He told you to scratch the Satanist stuff
on the hatchet and throw it off the bridge.

420
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,245
Sir, that's absurd and... And offensive.

421
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,084
But it's the truth.

422
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,165
What I don't know is why
this man risked so much to help you.

423
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,805
I think he's your father.

424
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,681
You don't know what you're talking about.
My father was a sea captain.

425
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,569
Am I wrong, Mr. Cicero?

426
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,802
- Yes.
- He was a sea captain.

427
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,367
His name was Sven Karlsen. He died at sea.

428
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,248
What was the name of his ship?

429
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,003
He worked on a lot of different ships.

430
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,250
The one he went down in.

431
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,640
She never said.

432
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,411
We can do a blood test to prove I'm right.
Takes only half an hour to get a result.

433
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,206
- Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?
- Yes.

434
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,681
Save yourself a needle.

435
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,964
I do hate needles.

436
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,769
I'm sorry, Jerome.

437
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,006
What are you talking about?

438
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,609
He's right.

439
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,481
I am your father.

440
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,804
- No, you're not. Why would you say that?
- You must have suspected the truth.

441
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,766
- You're not my father. Mother would never...
- Your mother was a cruel woman.

442
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,684
She was often unkind to me,
but she did once love me in her way.

443
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,849
And she loved you very much.
That's why she gave you a better father.

444
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,687
My mother was a cold-hearted whore
who never loved anyone.

445
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,801
And she'd never touch
a pathetic old creep like you.

446
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,371
All these years, do you think I was kind
to you because I'm such a good man?

447
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,005
If I wasn't your father, would I
help you as I have after what you did?

448
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,926
My father. Hm.

449
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,528
I'll be damned.

450
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,327
Oh, that's very funny.

451
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,561
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

452
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,403
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

453
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,291
Oh, you know how mothers are.

454
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,001
She just kept pushing.

455
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,205
And I'm like, "Fine, Mom. Be a whore."

456
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,567
Be a drunken whore even.

457
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,961
But don't be a nagging, drunken whore."
You know?

458
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,525
"Don't come yell at me to do the dishes...

459
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,605
if you've been banging a clown
in the next room!"

460
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,686
You know?

461
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,408
Long night, huh?

462
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,842
Things got kind of ugly.

463
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,288
- Yes, it did.
- You okay?

464
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,002
I'm good.

465
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,324
Truly.

466
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,650
It was ugly, but it was
also kind of thrilling.

467
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,367
- Thrilling?
- Thrilling and scary.

468
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,363
Like... Like looking down
a deep, dark tunnel.

469
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,043
Thanks for letting me be there.

470
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,167
You are an unusual woman.

471
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,564
You just don't know many women.

472
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,961
Can we go home now?

473
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,291
Mm-hm.

474
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,531
Hello, Penguin.

475
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,570
Victor.

476
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,288
How nice.

477
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,251
Don Falcone thinks you're messing up.

478
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,683
You don't know how to run a club.

479
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,762
Your numbers stink.

480
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,488
- With all due respect...
- I didn't come here to talk.

481
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,963
Good manners cost nothing, you know?

482
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,929
Relax.

483
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,923
He's harmless.

484
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,770
Say hi, Butch.

485
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,570
Hi.

486
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,009
Falcone didn't wanna throw him away...

487
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,370
so I worked on him in my basement
for a couple of weeks.

488
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,290
He's a whole new man. Right, Butch?

489
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,450
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

490
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,251
Butch knows the club scene up and down.

491
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,885
He'll help you out.

492
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,009
But he's...

493
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,043
He's Butch Gilzean.
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

494
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,609
And he'll do exactly what you say.

495
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,242
- Really?
- Really.

496
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,289
<i>Heh.</i>

497
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,444
Hey, Butch...

498
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,326
dance for me.

499
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,731
I do good work.

500
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,123
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Bruce.

501
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,647
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.
So happy to see you.

502
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,247
Thank you for meeting with me.

503
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,969
I have some questions regarding
Wayne Enterprises' business affairs.

504
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,327
Of course. It's your company after all.

505
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,005
Fire away, young man.

506
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
I have two main areas of concern.

507
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,770
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham project...

508
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,641
and chemical weapons manufacture
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

509
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,166
That's great. Congratulations.

510
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,651
We wanted to thank you.

511
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,731
If you hadn't figured out who killed Lila
and talked sense to us the way you did...

512
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,851
our families never would have reconciled
and we could have never gotten together.

513
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,322
- Just doing my job.
- If we have a son, we'll name him Gordon.

514
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,161
Well, we'll discuss that.
But we're certainly very grateful.

515
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,847
Sure.

516
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,164
- Why so happy?
- Happy customers.

517
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,443
That's not it. It's something else.

518
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,611
You got laid, didn't you?

519
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,047
That's impressive.

520
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,286
You slept somewhere without razors
and you smell like lady soap. Easy catch.

521
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,601
Mm.

522
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,245
I can only conclude that high-level persons
or groups within Wayne Enterprises...

523
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,681
have colluded in corruption, bribery,
racketeering and unethical medical research.

524
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,810
Thank you for that input, Bruce.

525
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,482
I'm so sorry if you've been alarmed
or upset...

526
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,042
by these shocking stories
and rumors you've been exposed to.

527
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,083
These are much more than rumors.

528
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,891
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

529
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,320
Bruce, let's be fair.

530
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,563
You've told us nothing
with any substantive proof behind it.

531
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,244
- I haven't told you all I know.
- No?

532
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,250
What else is there?

533
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,241
I hope you do look closely into these
issues, because I'll be raising them...

534
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,449
at the next shareholders meeting
with possible legal action.

535
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,809
Dear me. Legal action?

536
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,850
These are all very deep waters
for such a young man.

537
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,884
My youth is not relevant.

538
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,044
Except that if I were a man...

539
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,883
I would be chairing this board.

540
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,489
And I would be sure
that Wayne Enterprises was run honestly.

541
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,249
Thank you for your time.

542
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,123
The manager says you have a deal.

543
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,921
You go up and see him. I stay here.

544
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,565
- What's your name?
- Schmidt.

545
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,722
Your first name.

546
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,082
Thomas.

547
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,643
Welcome.

548
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,764
Why don't you take off that heavy gear...

549
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,281
and relax?

550
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,444
My family's gonna show you a good time.
