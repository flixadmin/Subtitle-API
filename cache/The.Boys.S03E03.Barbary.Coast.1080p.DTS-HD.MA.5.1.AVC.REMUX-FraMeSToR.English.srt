around the world.

Help the Contra rebels fight
the Russian-backed Sandinistas,

335
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,481
but we needed a way to pay for it.

had plenty of, it was cocaine.</i>

00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,120

the coke into the US</i>

<i>and then using the profits
to buy more weapons.</i>

342
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,127
In the fight against the Reds,
whatever it took.

00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,297
That's some self-justifying bullshit.

The unwritten policy

349
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,896
was to sell the cocaine strictly
to minority neighborhoods.

00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,024
doesn't Christ tell us
to turn the other cheek?

474
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,526
[chuckles, grunts]

475
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,363
I really want us to be sisters.

476
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,489
Mmm.

477
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,700
[Deep] I had something
made for you, Starlight.

478
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,577
It's a peace offering.

479
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,329
It's 24-karat gold

480
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,040
with certified conflict-free diamonds.

481
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,166
I've put in the work,

482
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,336
and I realize that when you've
made an unforgivable mistake,

483
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,922
the first person you have to forgive
is yourself.

484
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:33,640
What makes you think
that I want a daily reminder

485
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,434
of the guy who fucking mouth-raped me?

486
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,021
I need a word.

487
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,732
Let's let these two chat, shall we?

488
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,525
Okay. I'll just... [chuckles]

489
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,569
[door opens]

490
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,031
Absolutely not.

491
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,159
Do you really think I'm gonna let
a fucking Muslim in The Seven?

492
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,703
Captain Al-Qaeda? We're Americans.

493
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,623
- I'm taking this to Mr. Edgar.
- My speech last night?

494
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,334
38.6 rating and a 59 share.

495
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,920
Oh, and they're saying
that the live-plus-threes

496
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,672
are gonna be even bigger.

497
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:09,384
Edgar said it himself,
popularity is power.

498
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,177
He won't die on this hill.

499
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:19,519
Do I need to remind you
of the Flight 37 video?

500
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,523
[scoffs]

501
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,583
Go ahead. Release it.

502
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,003
Let's light this candle, huh?

503
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,090
I mean, sure, I'll lose everything,
but then...

504
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,009
I'll have nothing to lose.

505
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,140
First, I'll take out the nerve centers...

506
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,642
White House, Pentagon,

507
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,687
then any domestic defense capabilities,

508
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,897
and then critical infrastructure...

509
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,942
like cellular, Internet,
that kind of thing.

510
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,486
And then...

511
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,364
Well, I think then...

512
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:17,285
I'll just wipe New York
off the fucking map...

513
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,537
for fun.

514
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,165
I'll even throw in Des Moines

515
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,377
and that little cousin-fucker hick town
that Maeve's from, 'cause why not?

516
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,799
See, Starlight, I'd prefer to be loved.

517
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,970
I would, but if you
take that away from me,

518
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:42,018
well, being feared
is A-one okey doke by me.

519
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,229
So...

520
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,522
[sighs]

521
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,691
Go ahead, partner.

522
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,361
Do it.

523
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,034
No?

524
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,622
You don't want to do it?

525
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,583
[sighs] Well, then I would have to say

526
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,211
that you have absolutely
no fucking leverage

527
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,923
because I am the Homelander.

528
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,511
And I really can do
whatever the fuck I want.

529
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,807
- [door opens]
- [kissing, moaning]

530
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,727
[Deep] Okay.

531
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,564
- Okay, so tomorrow...
- Uh-huh.

532
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,650
...you have the
"Recontextualizing Feminism" panel

533
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,193
with Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano.

534
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,444
Ooh, I love <i>Charmed.</i>

535
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,279
- Hey, babe, I'm serious.
- Yeah?

536
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,740
- We need to cover your ass...
- [grunts]

537
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,534
...in case that bitch Starlight
comes after you again.

538
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,953
Thanks, babe. I couldn't
have done this without you.

539
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:43,996
You're telling me.

540
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,498
[grunts]

541
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,835
- [both breathing heavily]
- [Deep] Yeah.

542
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,128
[both moaning]

543
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,229
Oh, yeah?

544
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,940
- Yeah, you like that?
- Oh, fuck yeah.

545
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,108
Oh, yeah.

546
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,235
[Deep] Oh, God.

547
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,071
- You're so fucking wet.
- Oh, it's all you, baby. It's all you.

548
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,614
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

549
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:19,991
What are you gonna do?

550
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,742
Gonna jerk me off with all your arms?

551
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,035
All my arms?

552
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,662
Yeah. [grunting]

553
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,294
[retching]

554
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,628
[spits]

555
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,838
[sniffles]

556
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,480
[knocking]

557
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,608
[Ryan] Butcher, are you okay?

558
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,861
Yeah, mate. It's all good.
Just give us a minute, yeah?

559
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,196
[Ryan] Do you need any help?

560
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,407
Don't come in.

561
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,701
[cell phone ringing]

562
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,958
- Hey, Annie.
<i>- Homelander's had a breakdown.</i>

563
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,169
He's lost his fucking mind.

564
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,421
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Slow down, slow down. What?

565
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,299
<i>He's bringing the Deep
back into The Seven,</i>

566
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,260
so I brought up the video,
and he said to go ahead

567
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,054
<i>and release it. You were right.</i>

568
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,014
Cocaptain was a bad idea.

569
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,349
<i>I have to leave.</i>

570
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,101
Look, I-I know I should tell you
to run out of there like a house on fire,

571
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,519
and I want to...

572
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,023
[sighs] ...but you got to stick it out.

573
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,401
I'm sorry?

574
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,237
Listen, I'm-I'm-I'm back with Butcher.

575
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,657
Why?

576
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,700
We're onto something
that could kill Homelander.

577
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,203
What? What is it?

578
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,038
Some kind of weapon. Uh...

579
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,831
I'm not sure,
but you got to buy us some time.

580
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,291
<i>Keep your eyes on him.</i>

581
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,626
How much time?

582
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,212
Uh...

583
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,589
You don't know.

584
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,967
<i>So, for God knows how long,</i>

585
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,927
I have to paste on a smile,

586
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,680
<i>with Homelander growing more unstable</i>

587
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,223
by the hour,

588
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,642
hoping that he doesn't kill me or worse.

589
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,856
If that's what it takes, then yeah.

590
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,364
[sighs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just...

591
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,325
Homelander and-and Vicky,
they-they're running laps around us

592
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,703
<i>because... because we keep trying
to do it the right way.</i>

593
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,287
The high road just doesn't work.

594
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,000
W-We have to be as mean
and fucked-up as they are.

595
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,835
- Now you sound like...
<i>- Like Butcher, I know,</i>

596
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,337
but, Annie, he's... he's right.

597
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,547
<i>He's been right all along.</i>

598
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,466
I'm just so tired of losing.

599
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,969
[sighs]

600
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,888
Okay.

601
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,057
<i>You better pull this off, Hughie, but...</i>

602
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,892
okay.

603
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,272
[phone beeps]

604
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,069
I used to destroy you in slapsies.

605
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:03,362
You had super speed.

606
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,363
Ow!

607
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,282
- [laughs]
- Khamari.

608
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,701
Put another hand on your brother,
you see what happens.

609
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,828
Hey, Uncle Reg, what's up with that suit?

610
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,705
- Oh, you like it, huh?
- That shit's corny.

611
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,166
Hey, Khamari, that's not
how you talk to your uncle.

612
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,459
[A-Train] Nah, it's-it's all right.

613
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,294
Young men just don't understand
the history.

614
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,754
[Arana] Oh, no, the suit's ridiculous.

615
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,964
But he shouldn't be using
that kind of language.

616
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,592
All right, inside. Both y'all.

617
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,218
All right? And wash your hands.

618
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,470
For real this time.

619
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,057
I didn't want to say nothing, but...

620
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,602
Just trying to show the community
I'm down for the cause.

621
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,563
[laughs] Since when you been
down with any cause?

622
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,066
Come on, man.

623
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,276
I mean, I can't run, I can't do shit.

624
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,362
So I got to rebrand.
Stay in the game somehow.

625
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:49,200
Or you don't. You could just be
my pain-in-the-ass little brother Reg.

626
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,452
Yeah.

627
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,038
Let me tell you, man,
I'm happier coaching these kids

628
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,415
than I ever was working at Vought.

629
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,460
You should come down to the track.

630
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,836
They'd love to see you.

631
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,756
Yeah.

632
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,801
Okay.

633
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:11,597
Since you want to be down
with the cause so much...

634
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,848
Hmm?

635
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,726
<i>I was walking home,
and this mugger came up behind me.</i>

636
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,978
<i>I was terrified.</i>

637
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,147
[newsperson] <i>And that's when
Dana Whitmyre says Blue Hawk</i>

638
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,440
<i>came to her rescue.</i>

639
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,526
[Blue Hawk] <i>At approximately 7:15 p.m.,</i>

640
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,486
<i>I spotted a Black male
following the victim</i>

641
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,404
<i>southbound on Marin Boulevard.</i>

642
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,990
<i>I intercepted him, at which point</i>

643
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,284
<i>the suspect became aggressive.</i>

644
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,873
Brother lived a few houses up the street.

645
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,583
Three kids.

646
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,961
He was just walking home from work.

647
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,423
Blue Hawk curb-stomped him so hard,
it cracked the pavement.

648
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,343
- That's fucked-up.
- Yeah.

649
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,266
Maybe I can throw his family
some cash or something.

650
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,017
They don't need a handout.

651
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,477
They need you to speak up.

652
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,271
You're in The motherfucking Seven.

653
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,857
Yeah, but, I mean... [chuckles]

654
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,277
I... Listen, I'm Michael Jordan.

655
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm not Malcolm X.

656
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:13,159
Everybody loves the A-Train, right?

657
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,713
[Yevgenny] Sergei.

658
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,758
- Nina wants to see you.
- [Frenchie] Yevgenny.

659
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,177
How's your wife?

660
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,222
She still enjoy getting
her salad tossed by a Frenchman

661
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,224
while her husband tosses nothing?

662
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,061
Another time.

663
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,615
[Yevgenny] Get in.

664
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,995
- [grunting, breathing sharply]
- [sizzling]

665
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,206
Come on. Fucking knock it off.

666
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,718
[exhales]

667
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:29,985
All right, mate?

668
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,782
- Are you sick?
- No, no.

669
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,576
I had a dodgy kebab, didn't I?

670
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,036
Went straight through me.

671
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,537
Try these.

672
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,706
Well, I'll be.

673
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,419
[chuckles] Your mum used to give me these
when I was under the weather.

674
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,296
[chuckles] Same.

675
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,384
- I hated them.
- I used to crush them up

676
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,803
and put them in the bird feeder
when she wasn't looking.

677
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,304
Well, I don't blame you.

678
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,682
They done off leave your mouth
drier than a nun's...

679
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,144
You were gonna say "vagina."

680
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,022
Yeah. Something like that.

681
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,315
[laughs]

682
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,073
It's not just your stomach, though.

683
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,242
Your heart's racing. I can hear it.

684
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,453
And your blood smells funny, too.

685
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,126
Don't you worry, son.

686
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,795
Nothing a good night's kip won't sort.

687
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,388
[Butcher] Sorry about that.

688
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,056
What the hell did you drink last night?

689
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,977
Right.

690
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,730
Where were we?

691
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,898
To the surprise of no one,

692
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,234
that moron Swatto
went for another joy flight,

693
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,694
<i>giving away our position.</i>

694
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,573
<i>Even better, the Sandinistas
brought Russian special forces with them.</i>

695
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,867
<i>Though that didn't matter much
to the Supes.</i>

696
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,705
Those are my men!

697
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,040
[soldiers screaming]

698
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,708
[gunfire]

699
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:09,960
[shouts]

700
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,213
[soldiers shouting indistinctly]

701
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,215
[soldier] You, stay with me! Go!

702
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:20,846
[explosion]

703
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,222
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

704
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,600
[buzzing]

705
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,941
[grunting]

706
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,284
[soldier screams]

707
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,704
[gunfire]

708
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,543
Oh, yeah!

709
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:59,968
Gunpowder! Will you please fucking stop?

710
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:13,774
[yelps]

711
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,112
[exhales]

712
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,925
[fire crackling]

713
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,345
[sniffles]

714
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,726
[Black Noir coughs]

715
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,104
[Black Noir grunting, gasping]

716
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,638
[Tessa crying]

717
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,062
[Crimson Countess] Oh, God.

718
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,481
They killed Soldier Boy.

719
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,399
- What? Who?
- The Russians.

720
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:40,944
They had some kind of gun
or-or weapon or something.

721
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,529
- That's impossible.
- No!

722
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,574
- We saw it. We saw it.
- [helicopter whirring]

723
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,034
They took his body.

724
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,216
[Mallory] I lost 116 men.

725
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,092
And Vought got full immunity.

726
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,804
That was the day
I decided to make them pay.

727
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,099
Well, ain't that a wonderful story.

728
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,727
Tell me, Grace,

729
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,271
where did the Ivans take this...

730
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,815
Supe gun?

731
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,610
The trail went cold
behind the iron curtain.

732
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,153
It's the truth.

733
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,155
My reach only goes so far.

734
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,492
You knew what Soldier Boy did
to my family,

735
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,788
but you didn't think
I needed to know the truth?

736
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,249
It wasn't that simple.

737
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,508
Marvin, Hugh, give us the room.

738
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,369
You came to me after Becca disappeared

739
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,663
and promised me Homelander's head.

740
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,998
And all this time,

741
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,001
you knew there was something
that could do the job,

742
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,003
and you never said a fucking word.

743
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,754
Whatever this weapon is,

744
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,340
it probably won't work on Homelander.

745
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,717
- And what if it does?
- Even worse.

746
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,427
Because it wouldn't end with him.

747
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,972
You'd go after another Supe,
then another, then all of them.

748
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,640
If you'd have told me about this sooner,

749
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,726
Homelander might already be dead.

750
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,479
Ryan wouldn't be running
from one safe house to the next,

751
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,983
wondering when his nutter dad's
gonna drop out of the sky.

752
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,485
And Becca...

753
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,574
Becca might still be alive.

754
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,203
And for that...

755
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,334
I'll never fucking forgive you.

756
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,754
This was never about Ryan or Becca.

757
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,089
It was always selfish.

758
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,091
Always and only for you.

759
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,219
For the hate inside
that you want to let loose on the world.

760
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,140
I thought maybe you changed,
but I was wrong.

761
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,142
You are your father.

762
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,770
Always have been.

763
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,651
- What happened?
- We're off.

764
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,821
Butcher, wait up.
Where-where are you going?

765
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,199
- The city.
- When will I see you again?

766
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,784
You won't. Ain't safe for you.

767
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,077
Wait!

768
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,830
- What are you talking about?
- I got to go.

769
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,837
- Ryan, let go.
- No.

770
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,839
You said you'd always watch out for me.

771
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,717
- You promised!
- Ryan, let go.

772
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:53,178
- I won't let you!
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you.

773
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:56,723
After what you done to my Becca.
Did you ever think about that?

774
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,653
[Ryan breathing shakily]

775
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,286
I hate you.

776
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,802
[scoffs]

777
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,311
[announcer speaking Russian on TV]

778
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,275
[footsteps approaching]

779
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,121
Sorry if Yevgenny got a little rough.

780
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,498
He's still a bit bitter
you ate his wife's anus.

781
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:09,921
[lighter clicks]

782
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,300
Why am I here, Nina?

783
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,345
Do you remember Mikhail Petrov?

784
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,890
You wait for him to come home.
He step out of his minivan.

785
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:22,476
You attack. He knocks the blade
from your hand,

786
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,313
so you slam this Honda Odyssey
minivan sliding doors

787
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,981
on his neck over and over

788
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,692
until he's... [inhales deeply]

789
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,068
...decapitated.

790
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,988
Art. Who can define it?

791
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,034
Then you discovered his young bride
in the passenger seat,

792
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,746
and my Sergei
does not leave a witness behind.

793
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,626
Where is Cherie?

794

00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,458
[Homelander] Welcome back.

958
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,878
Thank you, sir.

959
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,504
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

960
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:00,423
- Congratulations, bro.
- You, too.

961
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,509
All right, well, unfortunately,
it won't be either of you two.

962
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,220
I'm sure you understand,
you just can't put a price on experience.

963
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,473
Please hang up your capes and go.

964
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:13,352
Now, Deep, I got to say, I am, uh...

965
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,396
Well, frankly, I'm moved and inspired

966
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,899
that Starlight here
has chosen to forgive you.

967
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,942
I accept your apology, Deep.

968
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,028
You deserve a second chance.

969
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,614
Thank you, Starlight.
Looks like we've all grown.

970
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:25,907
[Homelander] Just to be clear,

971
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,075
it wasn't my idea
to bring you back, buster.

972
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,495
Not at all. Starlight here insisted on it.

973
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,371
But you keep your distance, pal,

974
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,415
because, uh, well...

975
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,919
[laughs] ...she's my girl now.

976
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,921
[laughs softly]

977
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:43,799
Sorry, I-I can't keep it a secret anymore.

978
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,426
It's time we let the world know.

979
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,514
Starlight and I are in love.

981
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,895
- Cut! Incredible.
- Huh?

982
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,188
- That fucking plays, man.
- Oh, my God!

983
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,689
That plays like hell.

984
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,566
- That was perfect. Yeah, yeah.
- People are gonna love it.

985
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,236
[Seth laughing] Incredible! Yes!

986
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,987
[audio distorting]
Okay, that was perfect, uh,

987
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:08,032
but, Starlight,
I need you to be not so shocked.

988
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,826
[echoing] All right, well,
uh, let's go again.

989
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,079
[Ashley] Starlight?

990
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,081
We good?

991
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,000
[crew] We ready?

992
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,921
Yeah. Let's, uh, let's go again.

993
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,589
- Okay. Going again.
- Yeah, one more. Great.

994
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,841
[Seth] Uh, take it
from your line, Homelander.

995
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,052
- [Homelander] You got it. All right.
- [bell rings]

996
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,055
- That a girl.
- And... action.

997
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:34,141
[whispering] I just can't
keep it a secret anymore.

998
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,352
- Hmm.
- Come on, it's time we let the world know.

999
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,645
Hmm?

1000
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,063
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1001
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,691
[normal volume] Um, everybody,

1002
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,153
Starlight and I are in love.
