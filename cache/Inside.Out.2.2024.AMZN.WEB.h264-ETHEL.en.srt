1
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's play some hockey!

2
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:34,167
This is Joy, coming to you live
in Riley's mind...

3
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,833
and we are expecting a great championship
today with the Foghorns.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,917
Riley fans, get up on your feet...

5
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,917
and make some noise!

6
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,333
Go, go, go!

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,250
Let's go, Foghorns!

8
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,083
Bring it in!

9
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,500
Foghorns on three.

10
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,833
- One, two, three...
- Foghorns!

11
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:06,375
Now, it's time to greet your Team Riley!

12
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,708
Playing in his 13th year,
and fresh from the penalty box...

13
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,708
it's Riley's Anger!

14
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,875
Let me at 'em!

15
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,792
Helmet, pads, gloves...

16
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,125
safety checklist is complete.

17
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,583
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from...

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,958
Look out!

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,375
And that's Fear, keeping Riley on her toes.

20
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,792
We gotta get our mouth guard, people.

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,375
No, no, no! That's not ours!

22
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,792
And that, folks, is the infamous Disgust.

23
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,292
Glad to have her on our team.

24
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,792
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

25
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,167
Oh, no...

26
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,833
And bringing up the rear...

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,583
you know her, you love her...

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,000
the one, the only...

29
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,167
We got a penalty.

30
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,750
That's right, Sadness is in the house!

31
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:01,917
Yay...

32
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,958
Andersen goes to the box.

33
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,333
Two minutes for tripping.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,083
Okay, looks like we have a couple of minutes
while Riley takes a breather.

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,250
Let me catch you up.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,125
Riley is still exceptional.

37
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,292
Ta-da!

38
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,458
Yum.

39
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,583
And not just because
she's the top of her class...

40
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,625
- Riley Andersen.
- ...which, by the way, she is.

41
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,208
Riley, Riley, over here!

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,667
She's also really kind...

43
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,875
and she's nice to stray cats.

44
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,167
I mean, come on.

45
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,250
And she's officially a teenager now.

46
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,250
She got very tall, very fast.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,208
Did we grow overnight?

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,042
That was our favorite shirt.

49
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,500
We even got braces with extra rubber bands!

50
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,333
- How does it feel?
- Great!

51
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,750
Sorry.

52
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,458
Riley's Personality Islands
are still going strong.

53
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,125
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

54
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,625
But Goofball is still monkeying around.

55
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,708
Wait, where's Family Island?

56
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,292
It's right there.

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,333
There it is.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,542
What's that blocking it?

59
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,833
That's Friendship Island.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,292
Isn't it amazing?

61
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,792
But we realized her islands
aren't the only things made by memories.

62
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:14,083
Way down, at the root level,
these memories were also creating beliefs.

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,166
Homework should be illegal.

64
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,625
Get Up and Glow is the best band ever!

65
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,625
And my personal favorite...

66
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,292
I'm a really good friend.

67
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:29,250
Did you know the change in your couch
could change the world? Oh, no!

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Oh, no, we should do something.

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,125
No! That girl is a social Titanic.

70
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,292
Do not get on that ship.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,208
Guys...

72
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:41,958
Wow.

73
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,625
That is so pretty.

74
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,708
It's okay. I drop things all the time.

75
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:56,917
I'm Riley.

76
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,833
I'm Grace.

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,792
I'm Bree.

78
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,792
Turns out, when you put
all of those beliefs together...

79
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,375
they make the most wonderful thing of all.

80
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,167
Her Sense of Self.

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,083
I'm a good person.

82
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,917
It's what helps Riley make good choices.

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,375
Thirteen years of hard work...

84
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:20,667
all wrapped up in what some might call
our masterpiece.

85
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,833
You know, one of the hardest challenges
we found...

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,208
Oh, my gosh! We're back in the game.

87
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,792
We're tied.

88
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,250
How are we gonna score in time?

89
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:31,667
- We use our slap shot!
- No, no, no. We charge the goalie!

90
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,917
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

91
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,167
Riley's got this.

92
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,000
Thread the needle!

93
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,708
Come on, Riley.

94
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,083
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

95
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,875
Look at that! That's my girl!

96
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,875
And the Foghorns win the championship!

97
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,333
- She shoots and she scores!
- Champions, baby!

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Hey, girls.

99
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,375
Congratulations on your win.

100
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,167
That's the high school coach!

101
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,375
What a game!

102
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,750
That last play?

103
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,208
The three of you were impressive.

104
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,583
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

105
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,958
Look, it's last minute...

106
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,083
but every year, I do a three-day skills camp.

107
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,000
I invite all the best players in the area.

108
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,083
I'd love for you girls to come.

109
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,167
Are we in a dream right now?

110
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,792
Please, can somebody pinch me?

111
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,083
Definitely awake.

112
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,750
If we impress Coach, she'll put
the three of us on the team next year.

113
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,125
The Fire Hawks!

114
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,958
Finally, a team I can get behind.

115
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,333
What do you say?

116
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,833
- Yes!
- Absolutely yes.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
- We're there!
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

118
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,000
Great. We'll see you tomorrow.

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,833
This is amazing!

120
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,125
What a big day!

121
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,667
You are such an all-star!

122
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,042
You are gonna knock the coach's skates off!

123
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,375
- Hockey scholarship, here we come!
- Dad, stop.

124
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,125
It's just hockey camp.

125
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,417
I mean, who knows what'll happen?

126
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,708
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

127
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,083
My penalty almost lost us the game today.

128
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,167
What if I get to camp and I screw it up?

129
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,667
Hey, don't talk like that.

130
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,875
Yeah, you did great today, honey.

131
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,958
Exactly. Mom gets it.

132
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,792
Yeah, I guess...

133
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,750
We're so proud of you.

134
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:46,917
Night, monkey.

135
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
All right, all right.

136
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,708
Sleep tight, honey.

137
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,875
Riley's so hard on herself.

138
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,000
But we can make everything easier.

139
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,625
Behold, my super high-tech
Riley protection system.

140
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,875
Don't look, it's fine.

141
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:13,792
This is for all those memories that belong
in the Back of the Mind...

142
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,542
like this penalty one.

143
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,375
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

144
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,333
A one-way expressway to...

145
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,667
"We're not gonna think about that right now."

146
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,083
- Not bad.
- Joy.

147
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,375
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

148
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,708
You take such good care of Riley.

149
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,958
Thanks, I try.

150
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,792
Okay, let's do a sweep.

151
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,542
Here's one where she waved at a guy
who was actually waving at a girl behind her.

152
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,707
That was so bad. Good choice.

153
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,292
Here's when she forgot that girl's name.

154
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,458
Yeah, that was super awkward.

155
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,667
- What was her name?
- I don't know, Janet or something?

156
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,083
Whatever. Let's just get rid of it.

157
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,667
We keep the best and toss the rest.

158
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,333
Nice work, everyone.

159
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,167
All right, Anger, the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

160
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,208
Okay. Let's get some shut-eye.

161
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,833
Big day tomorrow.

162
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:19,250
Joy, are you taking that
where I think you're taking that?

163
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,417
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

164
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,542
I mean no. I...

165
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,167
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

166
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,208
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't been to the Belief System.

167
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Yeah, it's just that it's new,
and I know how important it is.

168
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,917
And I don't wanna mess it up or break it...

169
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,375
or burn it to the ground or anything.

170
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,958
Sadness, you won't hurt it, I promise.

171
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,583
Have I ever steered you wrong before?

172
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,542
Yeah, many times.

173
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,833
Come on.

174
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,375
Where I go, you go.

175
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,458
Oh, my goodness.

176
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,625
Mom and Dad are proud of me.

177
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,417
An oldie but a goodie.

178
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,792
I'm kind.

179
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,250
That's nice.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,458
I'm strong. I'm brave.

181
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm a really good friend.

182
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,833
I'm a winner.

183
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,500
And all those beliefs come together
to make our Riley.

184
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,083
I'm a good person.

185
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,750
What the heck is that?

186
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,750
Turn that off, Joy!

187
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,167
People, it's the apocalypse!

188
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,333
No!

189
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,708
What are you doing?

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,542
Problem solved.

191
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,542
Joy.

192
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,667
Okay, let's clear it all out.

193
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,750
It's demo day.

194
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,833
Demo?

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
Wait, wait, what's happening?

196
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,250
What's going on?

197
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,333
Who are you people?

198
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,042
Hey, are you the one in charge here?

199
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,833
Could you do me a favor
and stop tearing Headquarters apart?

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,208
No can do. Didn't you hear?

201
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,417
Permits just came through.

202
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,042
Permits? For what?

203
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,500
For expanding the place.

204
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,125
You know, for the others.

205
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,250
What others?

206
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,417
They're not here yet?

207
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,333
Hey, Margie, you got that console?

208
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me a sec!

209
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,250
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

210
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,333
- All right. She's all set.
- Set with what?

211
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,917
Come on, Riley. Get up.

212
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,292
Camp time.

213
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,333
Lunch break!

214
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,208
Wait, wait! You can't leave it like this.

215
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,750
Don't worry, we'll be back.

216
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,000
Come on. We're gonna be late.

217
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,875
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Let's go!

218
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,875
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

219
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,167
You're always on me!

220
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,042
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

221
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,667
Overreact much?

222
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
I barely touched it.

223
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,167
Those morons broke the console.

224
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,167
Riley, what's wrong?

225
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,375
Mom looks sad.

226
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,583
I'm the worst!

227
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,333
Oh, no. Honey.

228
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,833
I barely touched it.

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,125
That's what I said.

230
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,917
Let the professional handle this.

231
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,833
I'm too gross to go to camp or anywhere
ever again!

232
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,833
Oh, yeah, this is totally broken.

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,042
Well, we all knew this day would come.

234
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,667
Remember, we agreed not to make
a big deal about this.

235
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,167
But she really does stink.

236
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,208
It's bad.

237
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,292
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

238
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,708
You are not gross, honey.

239
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,917
You're just changing.

240
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,208
Remember that beautiful butterfly we saw
in the park last week?

241
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,750
- Well, that butterfly began as a caterpillar.
- Easy...

242
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,000
And just like that caterpillar...

243
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,250
- Easy...
- ...you're about to get your wings.

244
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,208
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

245
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,583
Just go away!

246
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,125
Well, that's a preview of the next 10 years.

247
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,000
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

248
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,583
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- All right.

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,542
Who's ready for hockey camp?

250
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,750
Yeah!

251
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,292
Okay, until we can figure this out...

252
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,292
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

253
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,500
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

254
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,042
Well, we could finally clean out the garage.
Or, actually, we can get upstairs...

255
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,292
How great is next year gonna be?

256
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,792
Coach Roberts' team has been state champs
like every year.

257
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:22,458
And Val Ortiz is the captain now.

258
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,583
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

259
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,250
She made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

260
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,125
That's really hard.

261
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,292
All we have to do is be super awesome
at camp...

262
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,292
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

263
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,625
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

264
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,667
We got a look. I don't like this.

265
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,083
What? You're paranoid.

266
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,333
I never miss a look.

267
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,208
Enhance 224... 176.

268
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,000
Track right. Zoom in.

269
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,500
Right there!

270
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,625
- So?
- She's hiding something.

271
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,042
But what?

272
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,708
What is she doing?

273
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,042
She's looking at our look!

274
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,917
No, it's much more than that.

275
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,583
She looks the same to me.

276
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,083
Overlay and compare.

277
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,917
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

278
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,500
It's so obvious!

279
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:15,750
But what does it mean?

280
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,542
She knows we're hiding something.

281
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,625
What is happening right now?

282
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,667
I don't know! I don't know!

283
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,333
I can't take this anymore!

284
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,625
You spilled the tea!

285
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,625
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be our coach
next year.

286
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,792
Grace!

287
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,042
We got assigned to a different high school.

288
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,417
Oh, no.

289
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,625
Okay.

290
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,500
Yeah. No big deal.

291
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,667
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

292
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,875
Is she serious right now?

293
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,333
- How long have they known this?
- I can't breathe.

294
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
We can't go to high school...

295
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,500
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

296
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,875
We'll still get to hang out.

297
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,583
And we'll have this weekend...

298
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,625
which means we'll get one last time playing
on the same team.

299
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,625
Friends are forever, right?

300
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,583
Yeah. Of course.

301
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,125
I can't wait to get to the rink.

302
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,750
- When do we get our schedules?
- I heard our room has a view...

303
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,666
This is so sad.

304
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,333
No, wait, Sadness!

305
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,875
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

306
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,916
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

307
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,166
Here we are.

308
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,833
This looks really cool.

309
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,625
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach? 'Cause I am available.

310
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,041
- Bill!
- No? All right.

311
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,708
- We'll see you in a few days.
- Have fun!

312
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,916
- Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

313
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,792
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley...

314
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,250
are you sure you have everything?

315
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,333
- Stick?
- Yes.

316
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,375
- Gloves?
- Yes.

317
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,750
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

318
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,417
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

319
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,583
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

320
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,292
Okay, call us if you need us.

321
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,458
I love you. Go get 'em.

322
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,667
Okay. Love you guys.

323
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,958
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

324
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,167
Bye, monkey.

325
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,833
Okay, now.

326
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,208
It's okay. We need this.

327
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,917
Guys, these are high-schoolers.

328
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,083
We do not wanna be red and puffy, do we?

329
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,083
No.

330
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,667
Don't worry, we'll have plenty of time
to think about this after camp.

331
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,958
Now, where did Bree and Grace go?

332
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,833
- There they are.
- Wait.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,958
Aren't those traitors dead to us?

334
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
Our best friends? No.

335
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,167
Hey!

336
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,125
Are you okay?

337
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,417
Everybody act regular. It's Valentina Ortiz.

338
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,625
We gotta say something.

339
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:30,875
Hey.

340
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,583
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know. You're the varsity captain...

341
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,375
you set the all-time goal record
as a junior...

342
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,625
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

343
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:37,792
What are we saying?

344
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,125
We are so uncool.

345
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,083
Why are we still holding her hand?

346
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,375
Just like me.

347
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,833
You're the one Coach told us about.

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,750
Riley, from Michigan, right?

349
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,417
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

350
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,833
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

351
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,375
Yeah, that's me.

352
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,958
Riley from good old Michigan.

353
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,750
Orange? Who made the console orange?

354
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,500
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

355
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,083
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

356
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,333
Hello, everybody.

357
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,667
Oh, my gosh. I am just such a huge fan
of yours.

358
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,667
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

359
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,625
Okay. How can I help?

360
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,250
I can take notes, get coffee...

361
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,500
manage your calendar, walk your dog...

362
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,167
carry your things, watch you sleep.

363
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,958
Wow! You have a lot of energy.

364
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,958
Maybe you could just stay in one place.

365
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,000
Anything.

366
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,625
Just call my name, and I am here for you.

367
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,833
Okay, love that.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,250
And what was your name again?

369
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,875
I'm sorry. I can get ahead of myself.

370
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,875
I'm Anxiety.

371
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,333
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

372
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,625
And we are just super-jazzed to be here.

373
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,000
Where can I put my stuff?

374
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,958
What do you mean "we"?

375
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,083
I wish I was as tall as all of you.

376
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,542
Who the heck are you?

377
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,625
I'm Envy.

378
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,917
Look at your hair.

379
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,250
Oh, yeah, not happening.

380
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,375
Look at her hair!

381
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,500
We need hair like that.

382
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,125
Oh, my gosh. I love the red in your hair.

383
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,958
What are you doing?

384
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,917
Hey, maybe when I make the team,
I can join Team Redhead, too!

385
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:01,917
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,958
Okay, who's this guy?

387
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,833
What's your name, big fella?

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,125
That's Embarrassment.

389
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,583
He's not really big on eye contact,
or like, good talking...

390
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,042
but he's a really sweet guy.

391
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,375
Well, welcome to Headquarters, Embarrassment.

392
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,125
We're doing a... No.

393
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,333
No, going high.

394
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,167
You got a real sweaty palm there, buddy.

395
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,167
Hey, do you wanna come with me, actually?

396
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,583
You can meet some of the other Fire Hawks.

397
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,750
This is exciting.

398
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,042
But we can't let her know we're excited.

399
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,083
Yeah, sounds good.

400
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,583
What emotion was that?

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,792
That's Ennui.

402
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,083
An-what?

403
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,000
Ennui.

404
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,625
It's what you would call the boredom.

405
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,375
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

406
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,708
Am I saying it right?

407
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,292
An-wah. No.

408
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,292
Nicknames! I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

409
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,625
No.

410
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,542
How are you driving?

411
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,000
Console app.

412
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,125
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

413
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,167
Now, now, I know new emotions...

414
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,042
can sometimes feel unhelpful at first...

415
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,250
and you just wanna...

416
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,208
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

417
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:11,125
But I've learned that every emotion
is good for Riley.

418
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,750
Even this turkey.

419
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,125
Okay, fine.

420
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,583
Cool. Lead the way.

421
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,750
All right. Grab your stuff and follow me.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
But what about our friends?

423
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,292
Val is our future.

424
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,792
Yes, I agree completely.

425
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,167
We need new friends or else
we'll be totally alone in high school.

426
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,333
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

427
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,667
- I mean, maybe...
- Here we go!

428
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,667
Wait up.

429
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,708
Thanks for showing me around.

430
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,000
Wait, why did you do that?

431
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,458
Sorry. What did I do?

432
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,292
We just left our best friends behind.

433
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,250
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

434
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,250
No. Okay.

435
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,292
These next three days need to be
about Bree and Grace.

436
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,667
Joy, the next three days could determine
the next four years of our lives.

437
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,667
Now, I think that's overstating things a bit.

438
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,000
Joy is so old school.

439
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,000
What?

440
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,583
Look, we all have a job to do.

441
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,917
You make Riley happy...

442
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:58,917
Sadness makes her sad...

443
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,333
Fear protects her from the scary stuff
she can see...

444
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,792
and my job is to protect her
from the scary stuff she can't see.

445
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,833
I plan for the future.

446
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,792
I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

447
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,417
I was using that as a cup holder.

448
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,708
Okay, so my team has run all the data...

449
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,167
and we're looking at the following
likely scenarios.

450
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,417
First, we don't take this camp seriously,
and we goof off with Bree and Grace.

451
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,917
Riley looks really uncool in front of Val.

452
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,500
She fails to impress the coach,
does not become a Fire Hawk...

453
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,292
and finally arrives at high school.

454
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,708
She has no one.

455
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,000
She eats alone,
and only the teachers know her name.

456
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,667
Okay, you and I are gonna be friends.

457
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,042
This is a sad story.

458
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a ridiculous story.

459
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,708
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

460
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,417
None of this will actually happen.

461
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,750
Right. Whatever you say.

462
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:46,000
You're the boss.

463
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:50,042
Remember when we all finally came up
to Headquarters?

464
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,833
That was like 30 seconds ago, Nostalgia.

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, those were the days.

466
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,625
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

467
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,125
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations...

468
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,750
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited...

469
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,500
but I will keep you in the loop, I promise.

470
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,875
- All right, you ready, Riley?
- Hey, hey, everybody focus!

471
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,250
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

472
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,750
And here we are!

473
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,458
These girls are so cool!

474
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,583
And older.

475
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,958
We are not changing in front of them.

476
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,167
It's fine!

477
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,917
Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.

478
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,417
Hey, come on! I want you to meet
the other Fire Hawks.

479
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,500
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

480
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:25,792
Hey.

481
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,417
Riley is from Michigan.

482
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,583
Okay, we're stuck with that.

483
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,542
Cool. Where in Michigan are you from?

484
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,250
Oh, no. What now?

485
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,250
Okay, looks like we're committing to this.

486
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,542
Cities in Michigan...

487
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,750
We need to make something up.

488
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,125
I'm from all over.

489
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,792
Nice. See you out there.

490
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,292
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

491
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,917
She wants to sit with us.

492
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,417
Everything is beautiful!

493
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,583
There's not enough room for Bree and Grace.

494
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,292
Let's go sit over there.

495
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,250
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

496
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:54,792
But thanks anyway.

497
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:56,833
Yeah. Okay.

498
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,833
No worries.

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,708
See? Was that so hard?

500
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,833
No. You're totally right.

501
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,833
That decision's not gonna haunt us
for the rest of our lives at all.

502
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,458
- No way!
- Bree and Grace!

503
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,917
- There you are.
- Riley.

504
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,792
Time to celebrate!

505
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,958
Say...

506
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,667
Okay, ladies. Let's all settle in.

507
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,583
Joy?

508
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,292
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Ladies!

509
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,500
Settle in means settle down.

510
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,083
I need your focus.

511
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,542
Which means now I'm going to need
your cell phones.

512
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,583
All of 'em.

513
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:36,167
You're here to work, not goof around.

514
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,375
Got that, Andersen?

515
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,083
Yes, Coach.

516
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,333
Please put all your phones in the basket.

517
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,250
You get them back at the end of camp.

518
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,625
Wow. Coach is so serious.

519
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,958
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe I could help...

520
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,125
Thank you. Not now.

521
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,458
I know, right?

522
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,500
You think this is funny?

523
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,292
Well, you know what else is funny?

524
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,500
Skating lines.

525
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,125
Now hit the ice, ladies.

526
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,292
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

527
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,667
Just make her do it.

528
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,542
Bravo, Joy. She's totally fitting in now.

529
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,542
Thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

530
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,125
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

531
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,208
- Skate harder!
- This is the worst.

532
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,458
All right, ladies, take a breather.

533
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,417
Then we'll divide into teams.

534
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,000
That Michigan girl is off to a rough start.

535
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh, no.

536
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,375
Are they talking about us?

537
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:39,708
Yeah, there's no way Coach is putting her
on the team if she can't get it together.

538
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay, Dani, like you had it all
together when you were a freshman?

539
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,417
I wasn't that immature.

540
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:48,750
Dani, you stuck straws up your nose.
Like last night.

541
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,667
I got you, big guy.

542
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,958
I always wanted people to talk about us,
but not like this.

543
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,083
Joy, what do we do now?

544
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,500
We can just...

545
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,917
I have an idea.

546
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:07,917
Okay.

547
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,833
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

548
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,625
Val?

549
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,000
Hey, Riley. What's up?

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,375
I'm so sorry.

551
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,458
I didn't mean to get the whole team
skating lines.

552
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,667
I feel terrible.

553
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,000
I respect you so much.

554
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,500
I would never do anything to mess you up.

555
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,000
That's laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

556
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:32,167
- Joy.
- You're a great hockey player...

557
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,833
and you lead the team so amazingly...

558
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,792
- and I really look up to you and...
- Okay, okay.

559
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:36,958
Thanks.

560
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,583
Listen, Coach was pretty hard on you today...

561
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,208
but that's not a bad thing.

562
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,708
It means you're on her radar.

563
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,750
Really?

564
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,708
Listen, I'm glad you came to talk with me.

565
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,875
Hey, let's try to be on the same team later,
okay?

566
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,458
Yeah. Cool.

567
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,542
Wow.

568
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,250
- Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

569
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,583
You guys, I mean, it really wasn't anything.

570
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,167
I'm just trying to help.

571
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,708
I agree.

572
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,000
Great job, Anxiety.

573
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,125
I stepped back, you stepped in...

574
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,000
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

575
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,792
But that was just part one of my plan.

576
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,042
There's a part two?

577
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,667
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

578
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,583
Okay, ladies, we're gonna form your teams
for the rest of camp.

579
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,042
Now, split yourselves down the middle.

580
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,208
Team one on the right, team two on the left.

581
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,292
Let's do this!

582
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,750
One more time on the same team, right?

583
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:21,917
Right.

584
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,125
Val wants us.

585
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,833
But we promised Bree and Grace.

586
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,792
Joy, we have to plan for the future.

587
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,333
Come on, Riley, move. Move those feet!

588
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,667
Val's on team one, you wanna be on team one.

589
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,750
Let's go.

590
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,500
She made a promise to her friends.

591
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,333
She's not gonna break it.

592
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,833
You're so right, Joy.

593
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:43,708
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

594
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,292
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

595
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,708
- Joy, I don't mean to overstep...
- No!

596
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,083
- ...but it has to be done.
- What are you... No!

597
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,125
No...

598
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,750
I know change is scary, but watch.

599
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,875
I'm so excited.

600
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,625
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

601
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,750
That is not Riley.

602
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,250
I know. It's a better Riley.

603
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,708
A Riley who won't be alone next year.

604
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,625
We build her a new Sense of Self.

605
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,792
A brand-new her.

606
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,292
No, no, no!

607
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,625
You can't go down there with that.

608
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,917
Over my dead flaming body!

609
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,125
I am truly sorry.

610
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,458
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

611
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,375
- Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?
- Get off me!

612
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,792
Riley's life is more complex now.

613
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,625
It requires more sophisticated emotions
than all of you.

614
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,208
You just aren't what she needs anymore, Joy.

615
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,792
How dare you, madam!

616
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,750
You can't just bottle us up!

617
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,458
That's a great idea.

618
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,542
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

619
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,875
It's not forever.
It's just until Riley makes varsity...

620
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,875
or until she turns 18, or maybe forever.

621
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,042
I don't know. We'll have to see.

622
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,417
- Bye!
- Anxiety!

623
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,083
Riley needs us!

624
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:10,958
Okay.

625
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,958
Don't worry, Riley. You're in good hands.

626
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,292
Now let's change everything about you.

627
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,875
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley...

628
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,083
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept...

629
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,542
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

630
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,750
Well, good news is
we're not starting from scratch.

631
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,042
I wanna plant one.

632
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,208
Next time.

633
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,167
If I'm a Fire Hawk, I won't be alone.

634
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,583
No, no, no!

635
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,500
Let us out now!

636
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,583
No, stop! Stop! Let us out!

637
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,750
Joy...

638
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,875
We're gonna be in here forever.

639
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:22,958
Where are you putting us?

640
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,000
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

641
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,208
We're not secrets.

642
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,792
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We're not secrets.

643
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,500
"We're making a big mistake."

644
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,000
Never heard that before.

645
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,833
We are suppressed emotions!

646
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,917
Let us out! Right now!

647
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,875
No, no, no. Riley's gonna be fine.

648
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,208
Totally fine.

649
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,917
Hey, there. You know what we call that?

650
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,125
Denial.

651
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,750
Can you say denial?

652
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,667
Hi, friends.

653
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,708
Welcome. It's so good to have you here
with us today.

654
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,792
It's Bloofy!

655
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,875
From that preschool show Riley used to like?

656
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,167
That's right!

657
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,083
And here's a little secret.

658
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,167
Riley still likes the show.

659
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,958
Stomp like an elephant
Scurry like a mouse

660
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,667
Make your way down to Bloofy's house!

661
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:12,917
Please kill me.

662
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,125
Bloofy, we're in a real pickle.

663
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,917
Could you help us get out of here?

664
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,833
We're gonna need your help.

665
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,792
Can you find a way out?

666
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,208
Who are you talking to?

667
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,250
My friends.

668
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,542
Do you see a key?

669
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,708
I don't either.

670
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,917
Okay, we're doomed.

671
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:33,958
Indeed.

672
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,500
Welcome to your eternal fate.

673
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,625
Lance Slashblade?

674
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:41,708
But he's a video game character.

675
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,917
Why is he here?

676
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,500
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

677
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,208
I never saw the appeal.

678
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,417
I long to be a hero...

679
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,083
but darkness haunts my past.

680
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,542
- I get it.
- I'm in a hundred percent.

681
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,125
Who's that?

682
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,875
That's Riley's Deep Dark Secret.

683
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,833
What is the secret?

684
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,917
You don't wanna know.

685
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:08,833
Riley's secrets, a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

686
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,792
Now, if you could just open the jar...

687
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,833
Hey, kids, let's learn some Latin.

688
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,750
Do you know quid pro quo?

689
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:18,125
We get you out of that jar,
then you get us out of this safe.

690
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,292
No, Bloofy.

691
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,958
Their destiny is not ours to change.

692
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,667
We were all banished here...

693
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,292
deemed unfit, worthless.

694
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,375
Don't you dare say that.

695
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,792
You do not deserve to be thrown away.

696
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:31,958
One second, Lance.

697
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,375
Don't you remember his power move?

698
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:35,958
I'm coming for you, Riley!

699
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,042
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

700
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,792
Come on!

701
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,542
You listen to me, Lance Slashblade.

702
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,708
No one is totally worthless.

703
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:48,000
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

704
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,417
Then you must make your curse your gift.

705
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,500
Shield yourself, my friends...

706
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,083
for I shall set you all free!

707
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:02,958
Hey, little help?

708
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,958
Great job, Dark Secret.

709
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,958
Now it's your turn to help us.

710
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,708
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

711
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:17,542
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

712
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,583
Oh, Pouchy!

713
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,417
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

714
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,208
Pouchy, we need to escape.

715
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,042
Do you have anything that can help us?

716
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,667
I have lots of items.

717
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,083
Which one do you think will work the best?

718
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,458
A tomato...

719
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,792
a frog...

720
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,000
or exploding dynamite?

721
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,583
Oh, for crying out loud.

722
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,917
Yay! We did it, everyone!

723
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,667
Let's all sing the "We did it" song.

724
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:47,708
No time!

725
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,750
Thank you, friends.

726
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,958
I must be leaving you.

727
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,417
What about Dark Secret?

728
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,708
Not yet.

729
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,750
Yeah, that's probably best for everybody.

730
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,083
Hey! Who let you out? Get back in there!

731
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,708
- Oh, boy.
- What are we gonna do?

732
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,917
Oh disgusted one...

733
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,833
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

734
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,708
Wait. What?

735
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,625
What's happening?

736
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:34,917
No...

737
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,083
Dave, help! Help!

738
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,250
Hold on!

739
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,750
Dave!

740
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,958
Lance!

741
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,125
Goodbye, friends.

742
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,917
Hello, destiny!

743
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, there's a lid for every pot.

744
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,167
Come on!

745
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,375
What do we do? What do we do?

746
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,333
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

747
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,083
Back to Headquarters...
to help Riley!

748
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,583
Riley's not up there.

749
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,208
She's out there.

750
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,083
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

751
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,417
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

752
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,500
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:08,917
But, Joy, how will we...

754
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,083
- Freeze!
- Come on!

755
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,250
Hold it right there!

756
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,917
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

757
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,625
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

758
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,583
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

759
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,042
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

760
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,292
First, all we have to do is...

761
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,583
Give me a second.

762
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,583
Follow the stream of consciousness...

763
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,625
and then we take a nice, easy float
all the way to the Back of the Mind.

764
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,583
- Where all the bad memories are.
- Exactly.

765
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,500
And there, we'll find the Riley
we know and love.

766
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,750
We'll put her Sense of Self back,
and then Riley will be Riley again.

767
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,042
Okay, I'm gonna give it to you.
That could actually work.

768
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,208
Yeah, it could!

769
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:50,417
And then I tell Anxiety,
"Hey, don't worry so much anymore."

770
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:54,292
And she'll say, "Wow, Joy, I never thought
of that before. Thank you."

771
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,667
And then we hug and become best friends...

772
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,583
And then I punt her into the dump.

773
00:35:58,417 --> 00:35:59,417
What? No, Anger.

774
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay, fine. No punting.

775
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,917
Don't worry,
I know right where the stream is.

776
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,708
Sadness and I have been here before.

777
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,542
Joy, this is a dead end.

778
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,000
Those are the worst kinds of ends!

779
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:15,542
Everything's changing so fast!

780
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,875
So, we're lost.

781
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,500
No. You're never lost if you're having fun.

782
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:20,792
No one is having fun, Joy.

783
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,500
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

784
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,333
She's having a great time.

785
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,125
I thought you knew where you were going.

786
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,292
I do. I did.

787
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,917
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

788
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,375
We're stuck here!

789
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,125
Riley's awake.

790
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,542
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

791
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,583
Come on, we'll find another way.

792
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,250
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

793
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,458
Why are we up so early?

794
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,875
Because, mon ami,
we need to speed things up...

795
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,375
and that means we hit the ice early...

796
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:58,167
and practice
like we've never practiced before.

797
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,875
Aren't we already good at hockey?

798
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:00,875
We're good.

799
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,583
But the Fire Hawks are great.

800
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,583
That's right!

801
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,583
Every time we miss,
we skate a lap around the rink.

802
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,708
Hockey is not a game, it is a sport.

803
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,583
- Yes!
- Wow.

804
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,083
That was amazing.

805
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,333
We need to be that good every time.
Let's run it again.

806
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,583
Hey, I see I'm not the only one
who likes to start early.

807
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,667
You guys, it's Val!

808
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,042
We had the same idea.

809
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,917
We're basically the same person.
We're gonna be best friends.

810
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,458
How long have you been here?

811
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,417
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

812
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,833
I just wanted to get in some extra ice time.

813
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,042
I'm the same way.

814
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,875
Oh, my gosh. She gets us.

815
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,042
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

816
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,292
You get what it takes to be the best.

817
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,750
Look at us.

818
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:55,583
This is going great!

819
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,250
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

820
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,375
We should ask Val lots of questions.

821
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,250
People love talking about themselves.

822
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,417
So, what was your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

823
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,167
I mean, it was a lot of work...

824
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,792
like, a lot...

825
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,000
but it's also how I met my best friends.

826
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,167
Val is sharing things with us!

827
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,417
Hey, a few of us are just gonna
hang out tonight...

828
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,583
order some food.
You should come.

829
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,833
An exclusive invitation.

830
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We're going!

831
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,625
- Really?
- Definitely.

832
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:24,792
It'll be fun.

833
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,667
All right, ladies, let's warm up.

834
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,333
Hey, Riley.

835
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,333
Hi.

836
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,583
We are not sharing Val with them.

837
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,500
Early mornings make me so hungry.

838
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:35,750
I know, right?

839
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,375
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

840
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:39,375
Yes!

841
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:41,292
See? I told you I'd find it.

842
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,833
The Stream of Consciousness.

843
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,583
- But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

844
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:46,917
Hop on something delicious!

845
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,417
- Joy...
- Deep dish.

846
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,167
And it's still warm.

847
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,708
Extra cheese, baby!

848
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:52,750
Sadness, come on.

849
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,292
But I've been trying to tell you.

850
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,500
We can't take the tube back, Joy.

851
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,375
Someone has to be at the console
to recall us.

852
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,500
She's right. We'd be stranded.

853
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah. Anxiety would have thought about that.

854
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,458
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

855
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,625
Okay...

856
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,125
So, someone's
gonna have to crawl up that tube...

857
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:10,542
and go back to Headquarters...

858
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,542
and at the right moment, bring us back.

859
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:14,083
I'll do it. I'll pound that...

860
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,333
I don't think so, punty.

861
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,208
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

862
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,208
Thank you.

863
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,500
You want me to crawl through a tube in this?

864
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:21,958
Yeah, not happening.

865
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,583
Oh, no, not me.

866
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,458
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

867
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,750
You know the console better than anybody.

868
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,792
You've read the manuals cover to cover.

869
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,375
I mean, you say that...

870
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,833
but I know a lot less
about Manual 28, Chapter Seven...

871
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,375
"How to Recall Non-Memory Objects"
than most folks realize.

872
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,042
You've proven my point for me, Sadness.

873
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,250
That sounds like a yes.

874
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,417
Where is everybody? You on break again?

875
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,708
Walkie-talkies. Here. Check-check-check.

876
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,000
Can you hear me? I gotta press a button.

877
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,417
Go for Joy. Copy that. Over. I love 'em!

878
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,833
We'll signal you
when we get there...

879
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,208
and then you bring us back.

880
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,000
Sadness, it's the fastest way
back to Headquarters.

881
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,167
Joy, I can't do it.

882
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,583
I'm not strong like you are.

883
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,125
I know you, Sadness.

884
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,833
You are strong.

885
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,667
I can't give you
specific examples right now...

886
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,208
but you got this.

887
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,542
Just don't look down and keep moving.

888
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,292
Yeah, I can do it.

889
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,042
She'll be okay. Right?

890
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,542
Fifty-fifty.

891
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:24,792
You want one?

892
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,000
But we hate those things.

893
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,958
They taste like cardboard.

894
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,167
We can't say no to Val.

895
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,125
Okay, no, you're so right.

896
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:34,625
We eat whatever Val eats.

897
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:35,792
That's the spirit!

898
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,542
Envy, I think you're really in the zone.

899
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,000
Take the wheel, I'll be right back.

900
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,833
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

901
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,750
- She picked me.
- You care too much about things.

902
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,083
It's got a very interesting texture.

903
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,292
It tastes like...

904
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,042
What does it remind me of?

905
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,292
Cardboard? Asparagus? Broccoli?

906
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,875
What are they doing to her up there?

907
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,542
I don't know, but we have to go.

908
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,750
No! No way am I step...

909
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,792
We have to. Riley needs us.

910
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,708
Okay, fine!

911
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,417
Gross. I think I'm gonna be sick.

912
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:29,250
If I'm good at hockey, I'll have friends.

913
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Okay, Miss Riley.

914
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,875
- Way to go, Michigan.
- Nice one, Michigan.

915
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,042
All right, ladies. Great day today.

916
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:45,667
Take it easy tonight.

917
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,292
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

918
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,000
Party time with Val and our future besties!

919
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,667
Why are we stopping?
What's going on?

920
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,417
There it is.

921
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,250
The red notebook.

922
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,625
Don't say it like that. You'll freak her out.

923
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,000
Why would it freak me out?

924
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,833
Only because everything
Coach thinks about you is in there.

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,750
The good and the bad.

926
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,417
- Whether she wants you on the team...
- Or not.

927
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,667
You guys, too much.

928
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,542
- What? It's the truth.
- She's not wrong.

929
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,417
What do you think she's written about us?

930
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,292
I don't know. Do you think it's bad?

931
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,542
Well, I didn't until now!

932
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,167
What if she's made a list of all
her favorite players, and we're not on it?

933
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,792
Or a list of all the worst players,
and we're at the top?

934
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,583
Or worse, we're not on either list...

935
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,958
and we fade into obscurity!

936
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,583
Sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

937
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,708
We're losing them, we're losing them.

938
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:38,583
Okay. First big hang with the group.
We just gotta act casual.

939
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:41,000
Why do our arms swing like that when we walk?

940
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,417
Try to keep them still.

941
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,583
- That looks crazy.
- Okay.

942
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,083
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

943
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,375
No, you're making it worse!

944
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,500
Well, that wasn't my intention.
I'm sorry for trying something!

945
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,750
What do you think pockets are for?

946
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,125
- That's good.
- Ennui, I am very proud of you.

947
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,667
What are they laughing about?

948
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,500
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

949
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,083
I don't know. We were too focused
on the arms thing.

950
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,833
Just pretend we get the joke.

951
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,708
Joy, Anger is taking up the floret.

952
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,292
Fear, what is the matter with you?

953
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,500
I don't like this vessel.

954
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:18,667
Well, that's all we have.

955
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,167
How much longer till we get there?

956
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,417
We'll get there when we get there.

957
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,875
I bet Anxiety would know how long,
down to the minute.

958
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:25,833
Well, she just knows everything, doesn't she?

959
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,042
Look, I don't like her words...

960
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,333
and I do not like her actions.

961
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,750
I just think I can change her.

962
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:32,250
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

963
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,583
Show of hands.

964
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,542
So, Michigan, who's your favorite band?

965
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,292
Everyone's staring at us.

966
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,375
There's only one right answer
to this question.

967
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,667
Get Up and Glow! They're so awesome.

968
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,208
Get Up and Glow!

969
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,708
I was all over them in middle school.

970
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,625
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

971
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:58,333
No! We need a band they think is cool,
not one we actually like.

972
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,417
Quick, recall everything we know about music.

973
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,167
We have to know one cool song, right?

974
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,333
-TripleDent gum
-Will make you smile

975
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,792
Embarrassment, get that out of there!

976
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,083
Come on, there's gotta be something in here.

977
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,708
- I'm looking, I'm looking.
- Something better, something cool.

978
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,458
Come on. No, not that. No.

979
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,000
This is the best we have!

980
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,708
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

981
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:38,458
But, I mean, you don't still like
Get Up and Glow, do you?

982
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,542
Okay, don't panic. What do we do?

983
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:44,000
If we don't like their music,
we have nothing to offer these girls.

984
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:45,708
We'll be outed as the imposter
that we obviously are.

985
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:46,625
Pardon. Excusez moi.

986
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:49,708
I've been waiting my whole life
for this very moment.

987
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,083
Yeah. I love Get Up and Glow.

988
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,583
Love Get Up and Glow.

989
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,417
Abandon broccoli!

990
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,792
- Joy!
- Give us your hand! Come on.

991
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,125
What is that?

992
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:19,667
That's a Sar-chasm.

993
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:21,250
It can open for miles!

994
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:22,792
Run for your lives!

995
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,083
Sar-chasm? Really?

996
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,833
Get Up and Glow is my favorite band.

997
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,667
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

998
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,333
They choreograph their own dances.

999
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Okay, Joy...

1000
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,750
if we can't follow the stream,
we don't know where we're going.

1001
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:37,708
And if we don't know where we're going,
we can't follow the stream!

1002
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:41,833
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1003
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,583
Or we could just ask those guys.

1004
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,125
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1005
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:48,292
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

1006
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,792
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

1007
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:58,042
Please, we really need your help!

1008
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,875
We really need your help.

1009
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:02,250
What's their problem?

1010
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,500
Guys, you just gotta turn on the charm.

1011
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:05,875
Hey!

1012
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,000
I bet you're the best crane crew
in the world!

1013
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,125
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1014
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,208
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1015
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:20,083
Yeah. Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1016
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,458
Riley, what are you talking about?
You love Get Up and Glow.

1017
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,375
Hey, guys.

1018
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:29,042
Why are our best friends
always trying to hang out with us?

1019
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,750
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1020
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,542
- Well, yeah. I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1021
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,708
We had a great time.

1022
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,125
Grace, you are not helping.

1023
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,333
Yeah, we had a great time.

1024
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,500
Great time.

1025
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,125
Why can't they just leave her alone?

1026
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,792
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1027
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,208
We go the long way, which is the best way.

1028
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,708
Stretch those hammies, Anger. Let's go.

1029
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,458
Best night of my life.

1030
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,458
Well, this has been really fun.

1031
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,750
Extremely.

1032
00:46:58,917 --> 00:46:59,958
But we're gonna go now.

1033
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,542
Okay, bye.

1034
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,042
This is the best band ever!

1035
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,125
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1036
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,958
See? As long as we like what they like,
we have all the friends we need.

1037
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,083
Night, guys.

1038
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,208
Well, I think I'm calling it a night.

1039
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,292
- Really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1040
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,583
Plus, I think you'll want to get some sleep
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1041
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,750
What scrimmage?

1042
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:22,333
It's just something Coach always does
on the last day.

1043
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,125
It's how Val made the team as a freshman.

1044
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:25,292
Don't tell her that.

1045
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,667
Val scored two goals.
No freshman has ever done that.

1046
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:29,667
Dani, stop.

1047
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,000
Technically, it's not your tryout
for the next year...

1048
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,625
but it basically is.

1049
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,333
You'll do great. Just be yourself.

1050
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,542
Did you hear that?

1051
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,750
We could become a Fire Hawk, like, tomorrow.

1052
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:43,042
But how do we be ourself
if our new self isn't ready yet?

1053
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:44,500
Excellent point.

1054
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,542
Let's get these memories downstairs.

1055
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,708
Is that broccoli?

1056
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:02,500
We're getting deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1057
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,667
Great observation.

1058
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:06,000
The long way did turn out
to be a little longer than I thought.

1059
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,792
Anyway, who wants to sing a song?

1060
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,958
I know a song. It's called, "I give up."

1061
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,750
Or let's play the quiet game!

1062
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,542
One, two, three, hush.

1063
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:16,583
I'll tell you what we do, we go back
up there and we kick those...

1064
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,083
Anger, now is not the time.

1065
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,083
Joy, this is useless.
Real Riley is out there somewhere...

1066
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,333
- and we're never going to find her.
- You know what? Yeah, these can go.

1067
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,250
No, no, no, I can find her.
I just need to get a better view.

1068
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,208
Okay, well, this isn't working,
and that's fine.

1069
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,750
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1070
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:46,917
I say we cut our losses and walk back.

1071
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:50,292
This whole trip is just a series
of deader and deader ends.

1072
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,458
Ever since that puberty alarm went off...

1073
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,167
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1074
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,333
I don't even recognize this place anymore.

1075
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,583
It's light out at 1:00 in the morning!

1076
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,208
I have never been inside so many jars
in my life.

1077
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,125
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1078
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:09,417
And if Joy can't see that, well, then,
she's delusional!

1079
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:13,875
Delusional?

1080
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,292
Of course I'm delusional!

1081
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,958
Do you know how hard it is
to stay positive all the time...

1082
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,625
when all you folks do
is complain, complain, complain?

1083
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:24,625
Jiminy mother-loving toaster strudel!

1084
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:27,458
Do you think I have all the answers?

1085
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,167
Of course I don't!

1086
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,792
We can't even find the back of our own mind.

1087
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,250
Anxiety is right!

1088
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:44,500
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1089
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,750
And that hurts.

1090
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:50,875
It really hurts.

1091
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:57,958
Joy, you've made a lot of mistakes.

1092
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,125
A lot.

1093
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,417
And you'll make a whole lot more
in the future.

1094
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,583
But if you let that stop you,
we might as well lie down and give up now.

1095
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,375
Well, actually, that does sound kinda nice.

1096
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,250
Come on.

1097
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,708
- Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1098
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,958
- Riley emergency.
- Thank you!

1099
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:24,625
Hop on!

1100
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:40,708
Let's just forget that ever happened.

1101
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,167
You don't have to ask me twice.

1102
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,583
Look.

1103
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,250
We're right behind you.

1104
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:03,792
This is great.

1105
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,417
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

1106
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,125
But if Coach doesn't put us on the team,
none of that matters.

1107
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:09,792
Tomorrow is everything.

1108
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,917
Which is why we're gonna need more help.

1109
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,250
Ennui, are you paying attention?

1110
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,250
No.

1111
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,250
Embarrassment?

1112
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,250
- Well, this has been really fun.
- Embarrassment?

1113
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,500
- Extremely.
- Never mind.

1114
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,000
- But we're gonna go.
- Okay, bye.

1115
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,750
Now, let's see. What am I looking for?

1116
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,583
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something...

1117
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,792
and then you get there to do it,
and you forget what you were gonna do?

1118
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:40,625
We'll need all the help we can get.

1119
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,083
That is exactly what I was thinking.

1120
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,708
Most important game of our lives.

1121
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,083
All right, guys, it's gonna be a long night.

1122
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,917
So let's get the team ready.

1123
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:16,125
Come on. We just need to cut through...

1124
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,042
Imagination Land!

1125
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,667
You guys are gonna love it.

1126
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,875
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1127
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,958
This place has changed.

1128
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,500
Mount Crushmore?

1129
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,042
Those are her top four?

1130
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,458
The only one that matters is Lance.

1131
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,208
Well, at least they got his good side.

1132
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,083
Every side is his good side.

1133
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,500
The Rumor Mill?

1134
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,458
Where all of our good gossip comes from.

1135
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:46,417
Pipin' hot rumors right off the mill!

1136
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,708
"The teacher's lounge has a hot tub"?

1137
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:51,417
"Lucy from math class is legit psychic"?

1138
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,333
"Abbie R's been texting Mike T,
but Mike T's been obsessing over Sarah M"?

1139
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,042
Where's the journalistic integrity?

1140
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,875
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1141
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,500
And it even got bigger.

1142
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,292
And orange?

1143
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:11,375
All right, 22, Riley breaks her leg
in practice, disappointing everyone.

1144
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:12,375
Nice job.

1145
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:15,333
Now, 18. Val and Dani whispering
after Riley misses a goal.

1146
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,208
Great! We need to help Riley prepare.

1147
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,667
Now's the time to send up every possible
thing that could go wrong.

1148
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,750
We are looking to the future.

1149
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,208
Every possible mistake she could make.

1150
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,625
Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.

1151
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,083
Riley misses an open goal,
Coach writes about it in her notebook.

1152
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,083
Yes!

1153
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,583
More like that.

1154
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,833
Oh, no!

1155
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,958
They're using Riley's imagination
against her.

1156
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,542
Val and her friends like us now,
but if we don't make the team...

1157
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,042
will they like us tomorrow?

1158
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,917
Okay, let's go to number three.

1159
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,583
Bree and Grace's team win,
and we look stupid.

1160
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:57,125
Number 22. Val passes to us, and we miss it.

1161
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,083
We can't let her do this to Riley.

1162
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,917
We have to shut this down.

1163
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:06,917
Love it, 37. Riley hits the puck
into her own net.

1164
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,958
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1165
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,542
I'm drawing Riley!

1166
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,083
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1167
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,667
I love her pony tail. Yes!

1168
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,417
Riley scores and everyone hugs her?

1169
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,125
81, that is not helping.

1170
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:21,000
Riley paints her nails to match her jersey.

1171
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,625
Everybody copies her. And she is so cool.

1172
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,875
Riley wears knee pads.

1173
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:28,542
We buy flowers for the losing team!

1174
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,792
What? I can't always be the rage guy.

1175
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,333
No, no. I liked it.

1176
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,833
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1177
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,750
I'm starting to think you guys
don't understand the assignment.

1178
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,125
What...

1179
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,375
What? Who sent that projection to Riley?

1180
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:47,042
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1181
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,042
What is going on?

1182
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,167
Who is sending all this positive...

1183
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,167
Joy.

1184
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,125
I know you're in there.

1185
00:54:58,292 --> 00:54:59,708
- Is that really her?
- Is she really here?

1186
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,208
Joy from Headquarters?

1187
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,833
The mind police are on their way.

1188
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,542
Well, I think we gave it our best shot.

1189
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,542
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1190
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:11,042
She's using these horrible projections
to change Riley.

1191
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,042
Joy, I'm doing this for you!

1192
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,208
This is all so Riley can be happier.

1193
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:19,292
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1194
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:20,667
Who's with me?

1195
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,583
Really? Nothing?

1196
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,167
Sorry, Joy.

1197
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,208
Yeah! I see you, 87.

1198
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,250
A cat.

1199
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,333
A little off-topic, but I'll take it.

1200
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,042
Who else? Come on!

1201
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,625
What if Riley is better than Val
and then Val hates her?

1202
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,917
Or what if Riley is better than Val
and Val respects her?

1203
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,208
Yeah! There we go!

1204
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:47,958
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up hockey forever?

1205
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,792
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries...

1206
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,208
and the Olympics call...

1207
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,417
and she rallies a weary nation to victory?

1208
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:57,500
Joy, reality is also a thing.

1209
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,208
No!

1210
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:04,958
Anxiety has got you all chained to desks,
drawing nightmares!

1211
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,625
But you don't have to take it anymore!

1212
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,958
Pencils down! Projections off!

1213
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:10,958
Yeah!

1214
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,458
Enough is enough!

1215
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:16,583
My projections!

1216
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,125
Pillow fight!

1217
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:22,667
For Riley!

1218
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,708
We need to be prepared.

1219
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:29,458
No!

1220
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,167
Okay, it's time to go!

1221
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,417
Yeah, I think so.

1222
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,667
- Bring it on, coppers!
- Oh, no, no, no.

1223
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:42,792
Hey, get back here!

1224
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:45,042
Quick! To the Parade of Future Careers!

1225
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,333
Grab a balloon!

1226
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,833
- A pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

1227
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,292
- Art teacher!
- Underappreciated.

1228
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,000
- Ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand what that is.

1229
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,125
Supreme Court justice!

1230
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,167
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1231
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,167
Get back here!

1232
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,000
They're getting away!

1233
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,375
Yes! Now Riley can get some sleep.

1234
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,958
I miss the jar!

1235
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,542
Joy doesn't get it.

1236
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,917
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1237
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,625
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1238
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:20,500
Coach will either make us a Fire Hawk
or doom us to a friendless future.

1239
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:22,958
I wish we knew what Coach thought about us.

1240
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,750
- Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1241
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:29,292
Everything Coach thinks about you
is in there.

1242
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:33,250
All we got to do is sneak into her office
and read it.

1243
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:38,958
Come on, Riley. Move those feet.

1244
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:40,750
She doesn't want to?

1245
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,833
Are we pushing her too hard?

1246
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,750
We got to see what's in the notebook!

1247
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,792
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1248
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:57,458
Riley, no.

1249
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,250
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1250
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,375
Sadness? Sadness, what's wrong?

1251
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:06,167
Why is Riley awake again? Over.

1252
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,833
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1253
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,750
- What?
- She knows better than that.

1254
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,333
She will once we get her Sense of Self back.

1255
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,583
Sadness, you have to stop her.

1256
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,583
Just don't get caught.

1257
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:20,292
Over!

1258
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,333
No, Riley, no.

1259
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Why did she stop?

1260
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:33,750
Sadness?

1261
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:35,583
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1262
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,750
My phone? Where is my phone?

1263
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:39,750
Seriously? This is not happening!

1264
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,208
No, no, no!

1265
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,750
Okay, she's got to be here somewhere.
Find her.

1266
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:45,583
Gotcha!

1267
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,375
Sadness.

1268
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,167
No.

1269
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,542
I know Riley sneaking around feels wrong.

1270
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,708
This isn't who Riley is.

1271
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,292
It's not about who Riley is.

1272
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:16,792
It's about who she needs to be.

1273
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,083
"Not ready yet"?

1274
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,833
Wait. Coach already decided?

1275
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,208
We're not making the team?

1276
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,458
No. We have one day left.

1277
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:40,958
What do we do? What can we do?

1278
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,458
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What would Val do?

1279
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,625
Well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

1280
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,333
Which means we're gonna need ideas.

1281
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,542
Lots of them.

1282
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,500
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

1283
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,583
Too close!

1284
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,125
Hog the puck?

1285
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,292
Trash talk the other team?

1286
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,708
Yes!

1287
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:14,208
We can't let these bad ideas get to Riley.

1288
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,167
Joy!

1289
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,292
- Smash as many as you can!
- Joy!

1290
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,125
Joy!

1291
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:31,417
I'll start sorting these into ideas
I wish I'd thought of.

1292
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,583
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1293
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,583
We need more.

1294
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,583
Get more!

1295
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,208
Get on the balloon!

1296
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,875
This is worse than the broccoli!

1297
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:51,292
Quick! Grab an idea.

1298
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,750
These ideas are too small.

1299
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:57,292
These ideas are too small!

1300
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,000
We need something bigger.

1301
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:04,542
That's our way out!

1302
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,125
Ready?

1303
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,333
Joy! We need this idea!

1304
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:23,250
If Riley takes one of these ideas,
it could be a disaster!

1305
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,500
Joy, the only way out is up.

1306
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,042
That's a big idea!

1307
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,167
I like it.

1308
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,542
Oh, no.

1309
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,167
Hold me!

1310
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,167
Seriously. Hold me!

1311
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,833
Fear, you have a parachute?

1312
01:02:59,125 --> 01:02:59,958
Yes.

1313
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,917
The real question is, why don't any of you?

1314
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:05,750
- Land! Yes! Stuck the landing!
- Yes!

1315
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:06,958
We did it!

1316
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,125
We made it!

1317
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,292
Come on, to the Back of the Mind!

1318
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,458
You're finished, Anxiety!

1319
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,125
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

1320
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:20,708
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1321
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,167
This is what we're missing.

1322
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:26,833
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

1323
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:50,958
Finally, we're one of them!

1324
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,417
What do you think, Sadness?

1325
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,750
- Well, I...
- Awesome!

1326
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,292
Red is really our color.

1327
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,875
Yeah, no, I mean, it's so much fun.

1328
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,708
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1329
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:09,250
They wouldn't know cool
if it hit them in the face.

1330
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:10,833
Hey, Michigan.

1331
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:13,417
Rocking the red, huh?

1332
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,667
- Yes!
- We are in.

1333
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,167
I hope it's okay.

1334
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,792
I know I'm not officially a Fire Hawk yet...

1335
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,292
but I figured since we're
on the same team...

1336
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:21,500
we should match, right?

1337
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:22,708
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1338
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,333
Did you sleep last night?

1339
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,625
No, how could I? Big game today!

1340
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,208
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1341
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,708
See? I told you not to freak her out.

1342
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,000
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1343
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,958
Get ready to score some goals.

1344
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,458
Yeah! I will!

1345
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,292
Val scored two goals in the scrimmage
to become a Fire Hawk.

1346
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,042
And you know what's better than two?

1347
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,125
- Three!
- Three!

1348
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:45,000
I was just about to say that.
We were about to say that at the same time.

1349
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:48,125
But how are we gonna score three goals?

1350
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,250
The new Riley will handle anything.

1351
01:04:50,417 --> 01:04:53,083
And I think this is the finishing touch.

1352
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,417
I'll be right back.

1353
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:03,667
Come on!

1354
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,042
We're so close.

1355
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,167
The Sense of Self is just on top of that...

1356
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,292
That is a lot.

1357
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,583
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

1358
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:18,875
When she walked into
that glass door at that party.

1359
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:21,583
Yeah, and breaking Grandma's favorite plate.

1360
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,792
Thank goodness these aren't part of her.

1361
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,333
Yeah.

1362
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,292
There it is.

1363
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:49,292
I'm a good person.

1364
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,625
Oh, no.

1365
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,417
Yes. Come on, come on.

1366
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,625
Here we go!

1367
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,708
I'm not good enough.

1368
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:10,250
What?

1369
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,625
I'm not good enough.

1370
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,958
I'm not good enough.

1371
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:19,417
Are you sure?

1372
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,417
Don't worry.

1373
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,583
It's just that she knows that there's
always room for self-improvement.

1374
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,750
She'll be fine.

1375
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,792
Sadness, we have the Sense of Self.

1376
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:28,958
Bring us back!

1377
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,375
Sadness, do you copy?

1378
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:36,083
I'm not good enough.

1379
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,583
Okay, I can work with this.

1380
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,042
I just need to recalibrate the console
and make sure it's ready.

1381
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,708
Just no more surprises.

1382
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,250
Okay, this one goes here.
Check.

1383
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:54,542
That one goes there.
Check.

1384
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,083
Not exactly there.
Here.

1385
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,292
Come on. Turn it up a little bit.
It's got to be absolutely perfect.

1386
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,458
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

1387
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:02,875
Sadness, now!

1388
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,292
Joy...

1389
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,167
Oh, no!

1390
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:38,208
I'm a good person.

1391
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:40,667
I'm not good enough.

1392
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,125
That was our only way back.

1393
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:48,083
- What do we do?
- We were so close.

1394
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,250
Joy. Joy!

1395
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,292
Where are you going?

1396
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:19,250
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

1397
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,500
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

1398
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,832
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

1399
01:08:35,082 --> 01:08:37,000
I expected better, Riley.

1400
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,707
That's not...

1401
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,542
What...

1402
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,667
Come on, please.

1403
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:00,625
What am I missing?

1404
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:09,000
I'm a good person.

1405
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,625
Joy...

1406
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:20,667
so what do we do now?

1407
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:30,750
I don't know.

1408
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,792
I don't know how to stop Anxiety.

1409
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:39,042
Maybe we can't.

1410
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:43,832
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

1411
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,292
You feel less joy.

1412
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:55,583
But I do know this.

1413
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:03,000
Riley will never be herself if we don't
get this back to Headquarters.

1414
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:04,667
Fast.

1415
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,208
How?

1416
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,583
Have a good game, Riley.

1417
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,083
You too.

1418
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,875
I'm not good enough.

1419
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,500
Yes! Go, go, go!

1420
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:29,875
Riley, I'm open. Pass it, pass it!

1421
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:31,333
I'm not good enough.

1422
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:38,333
Yeah, Michigan!

1423
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,333
Leave some for the rest of us, huh?

1424
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,458
Yes! One down, two to go.

1425
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:46,500
Okay, so how do we get our Sense of Self
from here to there?

1426
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:52,167
I have an idea, but I really don't like it.

1427
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,208
Anger, Riley needs us.

1428
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:59,042
Oh, Pouchy!

1429
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,333
Well, what are you waiting for?
Say the words!

1430
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,542
Oh, Pouchy!

1431
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,250
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1432
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:16,250
We know.

1433
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:17,958
Pouchy, we need to get back to Headquarters.

1434
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:19,708
Do you have anything that can help us?

1435
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,500
I have lots of items.

1436
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,875
Which one do you think will work the best?

1437
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,208
A roll of tape...

1438
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,458
- a rubber ducky...
- No time!

1439
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,208
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

1440
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:35,750
Don't you have, like, a jetpack or a plane
or something that's going to help us?

1441
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,625
What do you think, I have everything in here?

1442
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,333
I offered you the rubber ducky,
I offered you the tape.

1443
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,417
I know what to do.

1444
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,583
But we're gonna need a lot more dynamite.

1445
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,375
You know what? Good luck...

1446
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,583
Come on, Riley. Get the puck!

1447
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,292
Take it, take it!

1448
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,708
I'm not good enough.

1449
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:59,583
Michigan, what are you doing?

1450
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,875
We're on the same team!

1451
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,625
Yes!

1452
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:12,625
Well, Dani might be a little mad at us...

1453
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:14,625
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

1454
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:17,208
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

1455
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:23,417
Hold on, Joy.

1456
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,292
- We're gonna blow up this cliff?
- Yep!

1457
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:29,042
And then we'll ride an avalanche
of bad memories back to Headquarters?

1458
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:30,042
Yeah!

1459
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:33,167
And how do we keep the bad memories
from forming bad beliefs?

1460
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:34,750
I don't know.

1461
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:38,542
Yeah! What could go wrong?
I'm in!

1462
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:39,625
Ready?

1463
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:40,792
- For Riley.
- Let's do it.

1464
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,833
Here we come, Riley.

1465
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:57,667
Jump on!

1466
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,750
Come on!

1467
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:25,958
Man!

1468
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:29,125
I'm not good enough.

1469
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,042
You have to score!

1470
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,375
Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.

1471
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:44,417
No!

1472
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,792
Grace, are you okay?

1473
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,833
We hurt Grace.

1474
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,708
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

1475
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,708
I'm not good enough.

1476
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,458
Oh, no. What did I do?

1477
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,708
No, no.

1478
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,042
I can fix it, I can fix it.

1479
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:51,375
I expected better, Riley.

1480
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:53,500
Wait... No!

1481
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Come on.

1482
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,708
I'm not good enough.

1483
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:00,417
Come on, Riley.

1484
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:01,875
Get it together.

1485
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:03,458
Come on, Riley, get it together.

1486
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,167
I'm not good enough.

1487
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:08,375
You have to score, Riley!

1488
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:10,542
Or this will all have been for nothing!

1489
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,750
Anxiety, you're putting too much pressure
on her.

1490
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay, let's take a breather!

1491
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:46,250
- Sadness!
- Joy! Help!

1492
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,667
Come on! We can do this!

1493
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,000
It's not working!

1494
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:53,250
It's Anxiety.

1495
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,125
Anxiety, stop!

1496
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:21,125
You don't get to choose who Riley is.

1497
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,333
Anxiety...

1498
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:35,250
you need to let her go.

1499
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:01,292
I'm a good person.

1500
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:13,417
Joy.

1501
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,500
I'm sorry.

1502
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:19,625
I was just trying to protect her.

1503
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,625
But you're right.

1504
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:27,125
We don't get to choose who Riley is.

1505
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:35,708
We keep the best and toss the rest.

1506
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,208
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

1507
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,542
I'm a good person.

1508
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,458
Joy! What are you doing?

1509
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:37,208
I'm selfish.

1510
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,583
I'm kind.

1511
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,833
I'm not good enough.

1512
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,458
I'm a good person.

1513
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,625
I need to fit in...

1514
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:50,000
but I want to be myself.

1515
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,458
I'm brave, but I get scared.

1516
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,417
Success is everything.
I make mistakes.

1517
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:55,750
I'm nice.
I'm mean.

1518
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:56,750
I'm a good friend.

1519
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:57,833
I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.

1520
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,667
I'm weak.
I need help sometimes.

1521
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:01,208
Riley, you okay?

1522
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:10,500
Yeah.

1523
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:13,458
I mean no.

1524
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,417
I was such a jerk to you guys.

1525
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:24,792
When you guys told me you were going
to a different school, I freaked out.

1526
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,000
And...

1527
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,125
I'm so sorry.

1528
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,667
If you don't want to be friends anymore...

1529
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I get it.

1530
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,125
But...

1531
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:41,375
I really hope that you can forgive me.

1532
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:43,875
Someday.

1533
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:12,750
- Let's go, ladies!
- Come on.

1534
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:14,500
We've got a game to finish.

1535
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,458
Joy...

1536
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,917
Riley wants you.

1537
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,167
Riley!

1538
01:23:07,417 --> 01:23:08,458
Yes!

1539
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:32,917
Hey, Minnesota, how long are you gonna stare
at your phone?

1540
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:36,167
It's almost 2:00.
Coach is gonna post the list any minute.

1541
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:38,667
- Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in...
- Six minutes.

1542
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,125
And what happens
if we don't become a Fire Hawk?

1543
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,750
Well, thanks for asking, Joy. I'll tell you.

1544
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,917
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

1545
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:47,167
We don't go pro, and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist...

1546
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,458
even though we don't really know
what that is.

1547
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:50,792
We have no friends, and we die alone.

1548
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:52,167
Okay, okay.

1549
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:54,167
None of that is happening right now.

1550
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,333
- Is it?
- No.

1551
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,417
Great! So why don't we take a seat
in our special chair.

1552
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:00,625
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1553
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,542
See? Isn't that better?

1554
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,917
Yeah, that's the stuff.

1555
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,250
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

1556
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,875
But what can we control?

1557
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:10,083
Well...

1558
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,667
Riley has a Spanish test tomorrow.
We need to study.

1559
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:15,000
- You're right. We totally...
- Olvidamos!

1560
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,375
- What's that mean?
- "Forgot."

1561
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:18,333
- Someone paid attention in class.
- I never would've thought of that.

1562
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,708
- You're clearly an expert.
- Muchas gracias.

1563
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:20,917
Thanks, guys.

1564
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,333
Plus, we followed our new
varsity caliber training program.

1565
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:25,708
I wish I thought of that.

1566
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,333
Newsflash, you did!

1567
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,917
Wait, you're right, I did.

1568
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,625
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

1569
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:32,958
You're welcome!

1570
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:35,375
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

1571
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:37,417
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1572
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:39,167
Confetti if we make the team!

1573
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:40,458
Good idea.

1574
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:43,375
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

1575
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:44,875
Confetti if we don't!

1576
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:51,042
- Is it Coach's email?
- No. It's Bree and Grace.

1577
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,208
I miss those girls.

1578
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:57,000
Remember when Bree and Grace...

1579
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:58,417
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

1580
01:24:58,583 --> 01:24:59,958
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

1581
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,625
I'll just be downstairs if you need me.

1582
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:04,250
It's 3 minutes to 2:00.

1583
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:06,875
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

1584
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:12,375
Yeah! Right? 'Cause she's... Maybe?

1585
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:14,042
All right, Embarrassment.

1586
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:16,042
Everybody, look at Embarrassment!

1587
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:21,542
Hey, look, if you don't make it this year,
there's always next year.

1588
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:22,792
I know.

1589
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:25,625
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

1590
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,125
She's super smart.

1591
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:28,667
And great at hockey.

1592
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,125
She's really creative.

1593
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,583
She can be bored, but never boring.

1594
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,375
But she can be a little sarcastic
from time to time.

1595
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:38,542
She can have really bad ideas.

1596
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:41,417
Occasionally, she can do
the wrong thing.

1597
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,625
And sometimes,
she can be too hard on herself.

1598
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,708
But every bit of Riley makes her who she is.

1599
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:50,625
And we love all of our girl.

1600
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,833
Every messy, beautiful piece of her.

1601
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,042
So, Riley, how was camp?

1602
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,792
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

1603
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,417
- But what about sneaking into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

1604
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,500
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna tell her about the Fire Hawks?

1605
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:38,208
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

1606
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:39,375
Pardon. Excusez moi.

1607
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:41,667
It was good.

1608
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:46,917
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1609
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,208
And what about the red in her hair?

1610
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,375
Did she join a gang?

1611
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,000
Welcome back, Anxiety.

1612
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:56,500
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1613
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,458
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

1614
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,500
With a nice pass over to Reeves...

1615
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:03,125
comes across center ice.

1616
01:27:03,292 --> 01:27:05,708
Down to the line. Oh, what a move!

1617
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,250
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

1618
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:49,625
It's time.

1619
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:54,417
It's okay. Come on.

1620
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:59,000
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

1621
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:00,417
What's the secret?

1622
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:05,542
We burn hole in rug.

1623
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,708
Really? That's it?

1624
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,292
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

1625
01:35:11,417 --> 01:35:12,500
No, wait.

1626
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,708
And he's gone.
