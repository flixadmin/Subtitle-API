1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,269
Previously on Jackie chan
adventures...

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,006
The new year approaches.

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:11,443
It is essential that I have
all 12 talismans before then.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,479
Narrator:
When the talisman broke,

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:17,616
Jackie's yin was separated
from his Yang.

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,051
Bring me the talismans,

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,887
and I will make you
rich.

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,055
Works for me.

9
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,691
The bad me stole
the talismans!

10
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,192
Jade:
Most of 'em anyway.

11
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,495
Wait! If the dark hand
gets all the talismans,

12
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:32,064
then something really,
really bad's gonna happen!

13
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,732
Ooh!
Oh!

14
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,339
I...Live!

15
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,643
At long last,

16
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,179
my powers...Restored!

17
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,715
Speed, invisibility,

18
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,984
astral projection!

19
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,787
That thing's why
valmont wanted
the talismans?

20
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,089
And my personal favorite...

21
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,791
Combustion!

22
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,262
Aah!

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,365
Jackie!

24
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,934
Aah!

25
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,382
Aah--huh?

26
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,424
Whoa.

27
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,359
Oo-ooh! Ah-ha-ha!

28
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,662
Jacki-I-I-ie!

29
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,764
Grab my legs!

30
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,899
Whoo!

31
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,510
Call captain black!

32
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,178
Once I reach
the top,

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,714
you head
for the bottom.

34
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,350
Aw!

35
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,353
Whoa!

36
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,321
Shen-dude!

37
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,956
Uh...Welcome
to earth?

38
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,725
Good to see ya
up and around.

39
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,361
Well, the office
is a shambles,

40
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,197
but the lost treasure
of q'in shi'huang

41
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,200
should more than cover
the cleaning deposit.

42
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,469
Regrettably, valmont,

43
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,605
you did not provide me
with the talismans.

44
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,108
Jackie chan did.

45
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,409
A technicality.

46
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,811
Read my lips...

47
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,215
No treasure for you.

48
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:07,286
Tohru...Make this
deadbeat pony up.

49
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,587
You go, bro.

50
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,788
Yeah, we're
right behind ya.

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,856
In spirit.

52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,924
But master--

53
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:12,991
do it!

54
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,998
Hee-ahh--

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,133
w-uh!

56
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,734
Need I remind you

57
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,205
that I possess
the power of levitation

58
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,806
and super-strength?

59
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,007
Uhh!

60
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,816
All: Whoa!

61
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,087
(Huffs) Fine.
Treasure's yours.

62
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,295
Aah!

63
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,600
You...

64
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,502
All: He ain't even singed.

65
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:01,206
That, gentlemen,
would be our cue.

66
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,448
Too bad about
the lost treasure of...

67
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,849
You know,
whatchamacallit.

68
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,251
Will this affect
our bonuses?

69
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,019
You get a bonus?
Shut up!

70
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,022
Surprise.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,229
Come on!

72
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,932
Who--what are you?

73
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,736
I am...The keeper
of the talismans.

74
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:34,940
I am the apocalypse
of which legend speaks.

75
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,277
And I am...
For once and for all

76
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,847
your executioner!

77
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,315
Bad day, bad day,
bad day!

78
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,852
Aah!

79
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,554
Aah!

80
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,123
Uh--oof!

81
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,265
This way!

82
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,647
Jade...Please explain.

83
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,316
I think it used
the power

84
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,918
of the levitation
talisman combined
with the speed talisman

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,853
so it could fly.

86
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,790
What? What did all that
so it could fly?

87
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,124
Got me.

88
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,860
But it used to be
a statue.

89
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,000
Did the demon have
any specific markings?

90
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,935
Red eyes, great big claws,

91
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,872
and razor-sharp teeth
<i>isn't specific enough</i>
<i>for you?!</i>

92
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,274
(Growls)

93
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,543
Thousands
of demon sorcerers

94
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,545
have existed
throughout history!

95
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,447
I need more information--

96
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,682
a symbol, a name,

97
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,751
anything!

98
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,086
Chan!

99
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,990
Oh! Go away!
We have no more
talismans.

100
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,058
The demon's name...

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,128
Shendu.

102
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,568
Uncle: "Shendu was the evil
warlord of a vast kingdom.

103
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,570
"He was imprisoned
by his subjects,

104
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,973
"and the 12 talismans
from which he drew his powers

105
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,109
"were scattered
to the winds.

106
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,644
"He vowed to return one day,

107
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,646
"not only to resurrect
his palace

108
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,982
"but to conjure
dragon minions

109
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,718
"to wreak his vengeance
upon the descendants

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,987
"of those who rebelled
against him...

111
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,056
"By destroying...

112
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,692
All of Asia!"

113
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,926
(Gasps)

114
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,262
Mom...Dad.

115
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,670
Shendu's former palace

116
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,507
is located near
what is now Hong Kong.

117
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,744
His vengeance is to begin
at the toll of midnight,

118
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,214
ushering in
the Chinese new year.

119
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,050
Chinese new year?
That gives us only
a couple of days.

120
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,454
Less. Hong Kong
is 16 hours ahead
of San Francisco.

121
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,190
We'll take section 13's
fastest transport.

122
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,926
Finding the demon
is not enough.

123
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,928
One must have a means of...

124
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,197
Defeating it.

125
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,933
Thank you.

126
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,735
I will come with you.

127
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,603
I will come...(Grunts)

128
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,738
Too.

129
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,073
Um...That's ok.

130
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,776
Tohru...Why help us?

131
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:30,015
I am told section 13
serves donuts on Thursdays.

132
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,286
I am sorry,
but you must stay.

133
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,687
No.

134
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,124
Ow!

135
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,828
You stay here!
Someone must watch
the shop!

136
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,296
Good.

137
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,666
Now...Let me
gather some things.

138
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,871
Well...Whaddaya say
we save some lives?

139
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,442
Jackie, I <i> have</i>
àto come with you!

140
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,245
I'm an essential part
of the j-team--

141
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,247
the cunning one.

142
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,249
Jade, this
is not a movie.

143
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,852
You know that.
This time it is
too dangerous.

144
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,220
Hmmph!

145
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,858
(Jackie sighs)

146
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,793
Your mother and father
will be safe.

147
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,261
I will see to it.

148
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,531
And I will
see to it that
he sees to it!

149
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,936
Don't let your guard down.

150
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,906
Jade's, uh...Cunning.

151
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,644
Oh, guard!

152
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,280
Tell me, why hasn't
jolly captain black

153
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,849
graced us with
his presence of late?

154
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,552
I so miss his good humor.

155
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:45,023
Black's in Hong Kong
on a...(Laughs)
Demon hunt.

156
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,527
I see...

157
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,665
Big v, what--
what are you
doin'?

158
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,468
Raising cane.

159
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,055
(Water running)

160
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,057
What the--

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,834
I gotcha!

162
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,102
Huh?
Psst!

163
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,074
Guards: Hey! Let me out!
Open up! (Pound on door)

164
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,610
(Alarm)

165
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,951
Whoa. Jackie was serious
about me not going.

166
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,252
Valmont's escaped!

167
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,820
Seal all exits!

168
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,122
(Clanging)

169
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,431
Voice: This way,
I think.

170
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,234
Goin' to treasure
island.

171
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,004
Treasure island...
Hong Kong.

172
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,715
Uncle: Go away!
I am busy!

173
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:20,518
Uh...You've been
in the lavatory
since takeoff.

174
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,154
That is right!
Laboratory!

175
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,591
Do you want Jackie
to defeat the evil
demon? Yes?

176
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,228
Then go away!
Let uncle work!

177
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,073
Don't worry,
mom and dad.

178
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,142
I'm coming.

179
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,558
The palace!

180
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,763
Where?

181
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,166
Here...Where
the inscriptions
indicated.

182
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,235
Look...It's almost
midnight.

183
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,636
Oh!
Whoa!

184
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,972
What is it?
An earthquake!

185
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,490
Never question
the inscriptions.

186
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,532
Whoa!
What is that?!

187
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,405
What is shendu
doing, uncle?

188
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:52,644
Releasing his dragon minions.

189
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,995
Let's turn up
the heat.

190
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,966
No! Shendu is immortal!

191
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,703
Magic must defeat magic.

192
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,141
Men...

193
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,677
Jackie, this balm
will enable you

194
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,279
to penetrate
shendu's demon shell

195
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,448
and remove
the talismans.

196
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,017
Remove? All 12?

197
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,455
Not if you are cunning,
like Jade.

198
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:41,493
Certain talismans
offer shendu
not firepower

199
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,495
but sustenance.

200
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,498
For example,
without the reanimation

201
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,067
that the rat talisman
provides,

202
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,670
shendu would revert back
to being a statue.

203
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,411
Shendu: Soon, my warriors.

204
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,982
Midnight draws near.

205
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,321
What?

206
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,123
(Grunts)

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,995
The sheep talisman.

208
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,432
How many lives
do you possess?

209
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:25,136
Sheep, sheep, sheep.
Which power was that?

210
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,944
Huh?

211
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,949
Oh! The astral
projection talisman!

212
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:41,419
Of all the useless--
what am I supposed
to do with that?

213
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,890
He's out cold.
Men...

214
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,830
No! Magic must
defeat magic!

215
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,566
(Groans) Ah...

216
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,570
(Inhales)

217
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,706
Mmm. Fresh meat!

218
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,042
Huah! Huah!

219
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,413
My talismans!

220
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,101
You cannot harm me, chan.

221
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,737
The horse is the healer.

222
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,008
Ohh...Uhh...

223
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,877
And the rabbit is speed.

224
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,612
Buaah!

225
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,213
That tears it. Men!

226
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,148
Uh--ohh...

227
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,254
Who else wants
a piece of uncle?

228
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,112
Chan better keep
Rex the magic dragon busy

229
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,314
long enough for us
to line our pockets.

230
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,419
Jackie!

231
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,396
Monkey? I was hoping for--

232
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,032
rabbit!

233
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,870
Cute.

234
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,244
(Gasps) Invisibility!

235
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,419
It's the Chinese
zodiac hit parade!

236
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,058
Monkey see, monkey do!

237
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,672
The strength
talisman.

238
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,773
Good one.

239
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,108
I know, Jade.

240
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,177
Whaa--Jade!
How did you--

241
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,878
your hands!

242
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,114
I get it! That must be
some uncle magic!

243
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,215
(Gasps)

244
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,184
Ughh--talk later!

245
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,721
At last!

246
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,523
Well, boys.
Let's dig in.

247
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,898
The playing field...
Is almost even...Shendu.

248
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,134
You may have the ox,

249
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,136
but relative to me,

250
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,207
all that makes you
is a very strong
mouse!

251
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,146
No! Mom and dad...

252
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,282
All of Asia
are counting on you!

253
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,686
And me!

254
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,128
Pity you will not live
to witness my reign

255
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,729
over your world.

256
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,333
But you shall
be the first
to visit theirs.

257
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,036
Eee-yah!

258
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,705
What--da--

259
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,776
little Jade horner...

260
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,911
Pulled out a dog.

261
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,913
Rat!

262
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,517
No-o-o-o!

263
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,894
(Cheering)

264
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,562
What happened?

265
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,963
See?

266
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,698
What have we
learned?

267
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,969
All, annoyed:
Magic must defeat magic.

268
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,306
I <i> will</i> have my revenge,

269
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,110
if it takes another
900 years.

270
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,813
Tch. No rat means
you're just a statue.

271
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,882
And no dog means
you're not immortal.

272
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,135
But the talismans!

273
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,204
Never mind!

274
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,516
No-o-o-o!

275
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,328
Happy new year, Jade.

276
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,230
Happy new year, uncle.

277
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,331
Ow!

278
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,334
You destroyed
the demon yin and Yang.

279
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,269
Now the world
is out of balance!

280
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,205
Nobody told you
to destroy the demon!

281
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,540
Jade did it.

282
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,777
Now there is a void
for a new...

283
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,681
Stronger evil
to fill!

284
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,418
(Coughing)

285
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,290
I know how much
the treasure meant
to you, big v.

286
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,827
But how 'bout
a consolation prize?

287
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,499
You should visit
your parents.

288
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,435
They...Might want me
to stay with them.

289
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,304
Would that be so awful?

290
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,840
Tch...For you.

291
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,250
Uncle!

292
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,418
Come, Jackie!

293
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,353
Give tohru a hug!

294
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,955
Don't.

295
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,961
This...Will take
some getting used to.

296
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,131
Ahh...This and Jade
not being around.

297
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,768
(Sighs) I know.

298
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,870
Ah! That reminds me!

299
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,006
A letter from Jade's
parents arrived yesterday.

300
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:13,044
They are very pleased
with how much she has
learned in America. Ahh...

301
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,013
One <i> more</i> thing...

302
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,717
They're <i> so</i> pleased,
they want me to hang here
for another year!

303
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,985
Jade!

304
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,954
Jackie!

305
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,628
Jade: Hey, Jackie.
Do you think
you'll act

306
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,230
for the rest
of your life?

307
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,067
I know...I cannot always
on the...In front of screen,

308
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,669
but I can be a director,
a producer,

309
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,606
help the people how to editing
all the action scene.

310
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,141
A writer. Some other things
I really don't know.

311
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,044
Only thing I know is,
uh...Film.

312
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,681
I will be in the film industry
all my life.
