MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,337
AFTER 6 MONTHS IN HELL,

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,255
I HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON
AND RETURNED HOME

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,799
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL...

5
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,425
TO SAVE MY CITY,

6
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,927
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

7
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,762
INSTEAD OF OPERATING
OUTSIDE THE LAW,

8
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,973
I AM NOW WORKING
ALONGSIDE THE POLICE.

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,558
I AM NO LONGER INMATE 4587.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,143

THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA
BE ANOTHER DANTE.

14
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,734
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA
BE A LOGICAL REASON
TO COMPROMISE,

15
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,569
BUT I'M NOT DOING
THAT ANYMORE.

16
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,197
-WALKING WAY IS NOT THE ANSWER.
-WELL, I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.

17
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,824
I'M GONNA CALL
MY OWN SHOTS.

18
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,450
I WENT TO GO CHECK
YOUR MIDTERM RESULTS ONLINE,

19
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,827
AND I DIDN'T COME
ACROSS ANY TEST RESULTS

20
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,036
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
TAKE THE EXAMS.

21
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,205
-WHY?
-BECAUSE I GOT EXPELLED.

22
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,708

THIS PLACE BY WATCHING
THAT DOCUMENTARY?

THE DEATH OF STAR CITY,

AND THEY GOT EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DESERVED.

25
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,255
WE NOW HAVE
UNFETTERED ACCESS

26
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,550
TO THE ARCHER PROGRAM'S
ENTIRE SECURITY INTERFACE.

IN THE MORNING.

32

NOTHING.

PULLING A PRANK.

TROUBLE WITH YOUR PARENTS?

UH, YEAH.
ALL THE TIME. WHY?

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,056
BECAUSE WILLIAM DOESN'T
NEED PANCAKES.

37
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,767
WILLIAM NEEDS TO TELL US
WHY HE GOT EXPELLED

38
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,727
AND WHY HE'S BEEN
LYING TO US.

39
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,604
-AFTER PANCAKES OR...
-NO.

OK.

-READY TO TALK?
-ABOUT WHAT?

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,823
WHY YOU GOT
EXPELLED.

43
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,658
COME ON, WILL.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,743
TO US ABOUT
ANYTHING. PLEASE.

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,245
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
I JUST GOT INTO A FIGHT.

46
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,122

47
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,247
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
PROUD OF ME.

00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
I WENT FOR THE NOSE
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,668
WHEN DID YOU TELL HIM
TO GO FOR THE NOSE?

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,752
THAT WAS OVER
A YEAR AGO,

51
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,880
AND IT WAS A LESSON
IN SELF-DEFENSE,

THANK YOU.

53

YOU TO GET INTO A FIGHT.

EVEN CARE?

EVERY TIME THAT
WE SPOKE, YOU'RE

MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED HOW I FELT FOR ONCE,

60

BUT YOU DON'T ASK
OTHER PEOPLE FOR
THEIR OPINIONS.

YOU DECIDE EVERYTHING
ON YOUR OWN

62
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,731
JUST LIKE YOU DECIDED
TO GO TO PRISON

OF YOUR FAMILY!

THAT'S FAIR, BUT OK.

EXPELLED,

NEED TO UNDERSTAND

HAVE TO ACCEPT

HITTING THAT THING HARDER'S

BETTER, THOUGH.

SEE YOU, TOO.
GIVE IT TO ME.

ON FINDING THOSE BOMBS.

FEW DAYS SEARCHING
THE ENTIRE CITY,

HOW TO BE A GHOST.

OK. MY ALGORITHM
ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

92

THE ARCHER PROGRAM
WAS DESIGNED TO
MONITOR THE GLADES,

10 TIMES THE SIZE

WITH HALF
THE TECHNOLOGICAL

WELL, IT WAS ONE THING

153
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,709
WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE
IN OUR INNER CIRCLE

154
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,961
KNEW ABOUT MY
SECRET IDENTITY,

155
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,171
BUT NOW
EVERYBODY KNOWS,

156
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,841

EVERYBODY.

157
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,052
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
I'M JUST WORRIED

158
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,596
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY

159
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,390
NOW THAT
THE SECRET'S OUT.

160
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,225
YEAH. WELL, MAYBE IT'S
A GOOD IDEA THAT ME
AND THE TEAM

161
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,103
ARE GONNA BE HANGING OUT
AT THE SCPD FOR NOW

162
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,813
IN CASE I GOT TO
CRACK SOME HEADS.

163
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,315
OH. THANKS.

164
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,025
HEY. EVER SINCE YOU
BECAME CAPTAIN,

165
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,945
YOU'VE BEEN BUSTING YOUR
ASS TO EARN THEIR TRUST
AND RESPECT,

166
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,822
SO YOU KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

167
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,491
AND DON'T SWEAT THE HATERS
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HATE

-OH, DAMN.
-WHAT, DID YOU GET ONE, TOO?

173
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,508
AND SO DID LAUREL.
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO
TRACK DOWN WHO DID IT.

174
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,260
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
IT WAS ABOUT A CASE
WE WORKED TOGETHER,

175
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,928
BUT IF YOU'RE
GETTING THEM, TOO...

176
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,680
WHO KNOWS WHO HIS
NEXT TARGET IS?

[FLOORBOARD CREAKING]

178
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,700
OHH!

I CAN'T MOVE.

OH. STOP! PLEASE
JUST STOP.

I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

183
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,090
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

184
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,258
UGH!

185
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,641
WOW! THIS IS
A LOT OF BLOOD.

186
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,895
I THOUGHT KULLENS WAS
IN JAIL FOR HELPING DIAZ.

187
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,730
JOHN: YEAH. WELL,
APPARENTLY, HE HAD
A VERY GOOD LAWYER

188
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,940
BECAUSE HE GOT OUT
A MONTH AGO.

WITH THE TWO BODY DROPS

WE WERE LOOKING AT
LAST WEEK?

191
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,947
KULLENS DID HAVE HIS
THROAT SLIT, SAME
AS THE OTHER TWO.

192
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,741
I MEAN, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT KULLENS

193
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,702
WAS THE ONLY VICTIM TO
LEAVE BEHIND ONE
OF THESE NOTES.

194
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,204
LOOK FAMILIAR?

195
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,830
I SPOKE TO THE FAMILIES
OF THE OTHER VICTIMS,

196
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,374
AND THEY DID GET
NOTES, AS WELL.

197
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
-THEY JUST DIDN'T TURN THEM IN.
-RIGHT.

198
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,751
THIS IS TURNING OUT

199
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,545
TO BE ONE HELL OF
A FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.

00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
YEAH. LOOK AT US,
WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN,

201
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,382
BEING TARGETED
BY A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.

202
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,966
FEELS LIKE A MONDAY.

00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,468
WHAT ABOUT LAUREL?

204
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,387
YOU SAID THAT SHE
GOT A NOTE, TOO.

205
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,556
SHE DID, BUT SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S AT A CONFERENCE
IN D.C. ALL WEEK.

206

JOHN: OK. SO WAIT.
YOU, ME, LAUREL, RENE
ALL GOT NOTES.

207
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,602
-CURTIS AND OLIVER DIDN'T.
-OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

208
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,812
I'M DEFINITELY NOT
FEELING FOMO OVER IT.

209
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,356
WELL, WE ALREADY KNOW
THIS KILLER'S

210
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,982
NOT ONLY TARGETING
PEOPLE ON THE TEAM.

211
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,443
KULLENS WAS AGAINST

212
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,069
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THE OTHER TWO VICTIMS.

213
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,571
THERE HAS TO BE
A CONNECTION.

00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,197
WE JUST...BE PATIENT,
AND WE'LL FIND IT.

ISN'T A RED FLAG,
