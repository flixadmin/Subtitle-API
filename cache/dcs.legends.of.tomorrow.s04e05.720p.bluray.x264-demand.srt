00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,672
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,434
Your shapeshifting days are over,
sweetheart.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,837
You decided to exploit her
for information

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,560
<i>and to help us
track down other fugitives.</i>

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,872
I know you're writing a novel
and it's really good...

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,839
Taco delivery, my name's Mona.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,096
So what's a Time Bureau?

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
That was supposed to be top secret.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,673
I'm not losing another kid.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,117
<i>The magic you used
was pretty powerful.</i>

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,153
If magic has him on death's door,
then maybe magic can save him.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
I think I know someone who can help.

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,117
There's gotta be another way
to fix him, something Gideon missed.

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,796
John used magic to save
those kids at camp.

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,336
Magic's the only thing that can fix him.

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,750
And you really think
Nora Darhk is the answer?

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,960
She's the only witch I know.

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,560
Can we even find her?

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,996
That is the problem.
She has a time stone.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,151
She could literally be anywhere,
any when.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,073
The Bureau can't even seem to find her.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,674
When I was a kid,
there was this one escaped con

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,950
that my dad was after.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,835
And everyone assumed
that he had fled the country.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
You know where he found him?

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,632
Not a block from the police precinct.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,116
You really think she's hiding
in the Bureau's backyard?

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,080
Gideon, do a Nora Darhk
facial recognition scan in 2018.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,158
I have located
a potential match.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
That's her.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,558
Right in the Bureau's backyard.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,074
Great work, Detective Lance.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,856
Captain,
our systems have identified

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,314
the presence of a new fugitive.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,835
This one is in 1951, Tokyo.

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,832
All right, let's divide and conquer.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,674
I'll take care of Tokyo,
you go find our witch.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,353
Make her fix our warlock.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,874
<i>Everybody to the bridge,
we got a fugitive alert.</i>

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,030
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,315
<i>Hello?</i>

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
<i>Anyone hear me?</i>

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Drat.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,116
Hey.

45
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,794
Closed door means stay out.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,633
Sorry, Sara called a team meeting.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,752
- Were you...
- Yes.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,916
I was watching porn.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,150
On a typewriter?

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,280
Hey, no judgment here.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
All right...

52
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,756
Chop chop.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,956
Oi.

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,520
Enough shouting.

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,555
That my whiskey?

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,710
It was.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,638
Oh, well, look who finally
pried themselves away

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,479
from their important business.

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,314
Look, hobbies are very important.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,030
Right, Rory?

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,676
I take my porn very seriously.

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,359
Okay, back to work.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,751
In the summer of 1951,
a film crew shot footage

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,797
of a monster in Tokyo Bay.

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,951
Two days later, the city was destroyed.

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,757
We need to get that footage
before any panic sets in

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,117
and to capture that monster
before it can do any real damage.

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,353
And because we're short-handed,
you're up.

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,029
Time to earn your keep.

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,993
Well, I didn't ask to be here, ma'am.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,116
But you are a fugitive,

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,920
so your choices are help us out,

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,514
go back in your cage.

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,393
Bloody humans.

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
All right, fine.

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,955
But it's only to stop you blinkered lot

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,635
from giving a harmless monster
a one-way ticket to Hell.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,755
At least with me there,
the poor chap gets a fair shake.

79
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,871
I like her, yes, I like her.

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,149
As you can see, Mr. Heywood,

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,511
the Time Bureau is putting your money
to great use.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,496
We have multiple teams
deployed throughout history

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,976
tracking down and securing fugitives.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,514
All trained by your son.

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,195
And we only have the most highly
qualified Time Bureau personnel

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,475
dealing with... Oh, boy.

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,756
And here's Gary with a live one.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,150
Ah! Say hello to Baba-Yaga.

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,512
We caught her trying
to eat Chinese gymnasts

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
at the 2008 Olympics.

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,678
- Sorry about that, sir.
- What did she say?

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,275
Just a typical Russian greeting.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,336
Are you sure this room

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,856
is secure enough
to hold these creatures?

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,599
It's a temporary arrangement

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,456
until our containment facility
is up and running, sir.

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,631
And they are heavily sedated,
right, Gary?

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,474
Yeah, double doses
of elephant tranquilizer all around.

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,316
This way.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,776
Director Sharpe, it looks like you have
things under control here.

101
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,154
Yes, sir, we sure do.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,152
I'll be seeing you tomorrow
for Thanksgiving.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
Your mother's really
looking forward to it

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,350
and so am I.

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,156
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

106
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,296
What are you doing
for the holiday, Director Sharpe?

107
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,040
Me? Oh, well, I was planning
on spending it with my girlfriend,

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,474
but she's working overtime,

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,069
so I'll probably just
be sticking around here, I guess.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,296
You should join us.

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,800
It'll be fun, right, Nathaniel?

112
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
Absolutely.

113
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,034
Bye, sir.

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,476
Yeah, that is if you don't mind
starving all day

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,075
while your family slowly
gets loaded and starts fighting

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,760
and then your dad gets called
for a "work emergency."

117
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,198
Well, at least your family
are real people.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,589
Mine are actors.

119
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
According to historical record,
the director we're looking for,

120
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,157
Ishiro Honda, should be in this stage.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,712
Well, I'm feeling a little conspicuous.

122
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,110
Just act like you belong.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,680
- No one will question it.
- You.

124
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,989
Coffee. Now.

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,150
Yeah, see?

126
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
It's all about confidence.

127
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,639
All right, you guys know your cover?

128
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,756
Yeah.

129
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,435
I beg your pardon,

130
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,716
but this is a closed set.

131
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,071
Are you Ishiro Honda the film director?

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,079
- Huh.
- Honda-san, pleasure to meet you.

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,271
We're producers from K&G Pictures,

134
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,194
we got word of an unusual
animal sighting out in the bay.

135
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,856
We were told you might
have some footage suitable

136
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,916
for our news reel?

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,271
- How do you know about that?
- We're from Hollywood,

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,794
we know everything.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,070
<i>Gracias.</i>

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,719
You must have misheard.

141
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,193
We were out on location by the sea, yes.

142
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,354
And we saw a whale.

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,712
And that was it.

144
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,076
You're sure it wasn't something else?

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
Something strange?

146
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,030
Perhaps we could take a look
and see for ourselves.

147
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,230
Uh, I'm afraid the footage
was ruined during transport.

148
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,719
<i>It truly isn't possible.</i>

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,429
No, the bloke's lying.

151
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,830
Mm. Finally, something we agree on.

152
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,070
- Stay here.
- What?

153
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,277
- Where are you going?
- To find that film.

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,795
Oh, not if I find it first.

155
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,515
I have to go now.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,115
Mr. Honda. Mr. Honda.

157
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,391
Could we trouble you for a tour?

158
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,955
Of course.

159
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,156
Please.

160
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,472
When we are on a mission,
I give the orders.

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,909
Whose rubbish idea was that?

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
You are lucky
I am a reformed assassin.

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,313
It's quite a remarkable effect.

164
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,635
If we shoot at low angles
with a wide lens,

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,756
it feels as though
we are ants in this enormous city.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,433
That is fascinating.

167
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,599
It's gotta be in his office somewhere.

168
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,550
If I was hiding something, I would
put it where no one else would look.

169
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,436
Like under a bloody bomb.

170
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,115
Genius.

171
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,920
It'd look amazing on fire.

172
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,235
Thank you so much for the tour,
if you are ever in Burbank,

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,549
be sure to look us up.

174
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,296
I've successfully digitized
the film and it's ready for viewing.

175
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,515
Roll it, Ms. G.

176
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,478
What is that under the water?

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,157
Whoa.

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,996
Guys, I think we're gonna
need a bigger Timeship.

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,719
Okay, what is it?

180
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,757
You're supposed to be
the fugitive expert.

181
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,479
Oh, well, that's no fugitive.

182
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,756
So what? It's just some
other magical monster

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
that's not supposed to be here?

184
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,993
Maybe you just haven't met this one.

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Or maybe if you weren't so quick
to blame us fugitives

186
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
for everything, you'd see
the more likely scenario.

187
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
That creature is man-made.

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,632
It's probably a mutant or something

189
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,393
created by one of the countless nukes

190
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,280
you humans dropped
on the Pacific in this era.

191
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Or didn't you think of that?

192
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,793
Nice try, genius, but if that were true,

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
we wouldn't have gotten a magic alert,

194
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,954
so why are we here?

195
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,431
Ooh, you're the time traveler,
when don't you figure it out?

196
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,597
Okay, Gideon,

197
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,077
scan Tokyo Bay
for any unusual marine activity.

198
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,555
Right away, Captain.

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,677
Hopefully,
Ray's having better luck.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,954
Huh.

201
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,233
I had a dream like this once.

202
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,194
Maybe more than once.

203
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,871
More mead, wench.

204
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,996
As you wish.

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,110
Oh, a thousand pardons.

206
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Hmm.

207
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,536
Oh.

208
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,119
Ah.

209
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,070
Palmer Tech phone? Huh, great software.

210
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,636
Terrible hardware.

211
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,350
My phone.

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,237
Get ye out of my sight, scoundrel.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,229
- What are...
- Oh.

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

215
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,635
I need your help.

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,153
Chris and Tyson, you two
get back here right now.

217
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Hi, Nate.

218
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,679
- Hey, Patty, this is...
- Hi, uh...

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,516
Ava Sharpe. Um...

220
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,716
Hi, Grandma.

221
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,111
That's my grandma, Violet,
do not let her rope you

222
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,669
into playing cards,
it's a lose-lose situation.

223
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,636
And there's my Uncle Rich.

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,634
Don't mention Obama.

225
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
There he is.

226
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,833
- Hey.
- Good to see you, son.

227
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,416
Glad you could make it, Director Sharpe.

228
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,238
- Thanks.
- You must be Ava.

229
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,312
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

230
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,757
Thank you so much
for letting me join you.

231
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,436
Oh, of course, we wouldn't want you
all alone on such a special day.

232
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,960
He's into the good stuff.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,913
Nate, show her around,
make her feel at home.

234
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,198
- Wow.
- Wow.

235
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,119
Your family seems nice.

236
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,157
Oh, it's still very early.

237
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,197
Okay, everyone.

238
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,909
- The turkey is almost done.
- Wait for it.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,631
Brining. Yeah. It just has
to sit for another hour and a half

240
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,320
and then I'm gonna pop it into the oven.

241
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,233
So that means dinner is when?

242
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,193
Mm, give or take, six hours.

243
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,960
What?

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,878
Oh, my God.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,231
- Tyson.
- Buckle up, Ava Sharpe.

246
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,016
- I'm gonna tell on you.
- It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

247
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,076
No!

248
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,193
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Green.

249
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,794
Hi, Mona.

250
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,998
Thanks for bringing me food
on a holiday.

251
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,753
It's literally my job.

252
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,519
Why are you working on Thanksgiving?

253
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,437
What does the Time Bureau do anyway?

254
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,117
Oh, it's like Groundhog Day.

255
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,112
Uh, we regulate time zones.

256
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,352
So you got any plans for the big meal?

257
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,715
Heck yeah, I do.

258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,793
My family's in LA,
so it's just me, instant ramen,

259
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
and Bestflix bingeing.

260
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,236
Oh, well, if you want, you could...

261
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,917
Uh, have Thanksgiving with me.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,798
That's really sweet, Mr. Green.

263
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,599
But I don't wanna eat all your food.

264
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,754
Oh, I happen to have
ordered enough for two.

265
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,353
You're vegetarian, right?

266
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,872
Nora Darhk, what the bloomin' hell
are you doing here, eh?

267
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,874
I owed this guy a favor.

268
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,795
She shouldn't be here, mate,
I thought I warned you.

269
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,795
Can you help him?

270
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,878
Gideon's showing strange
marine activity in this area.

271
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,919
Fish disappearing en masse,
seismic tremors.

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,336
You need all that just to end up
back where the film was shot?

273
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Just being thorough.

274
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,151
Hm, using fancy toys
instead of your noggins, more like.

275
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,416
You know, I think I liked you
better when you were in a cage.

276
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
All right, enough.

277
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,957
All we gotta do is draw this thing out.

278
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,157
We shrink it down and we're good to go.

279
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,913
How do you expect us to do that?

280
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,920
What, just summon it
with a friendly call?

281
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,590
"Oi, monster, come up here.
Promise it's not a trap."

282
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,519
Or feed it like that guy.

283
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,391
Isn't that our friend,
the film director?

284
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,832
Feeding the whales, Mr. Honda?

285
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,277
You, what are you doing here?

286
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,430
You first.

287
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,795
Start talking.

288
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,789
What the hell is that?

289
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,914
It's evil.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,434
Truly evil.

291
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,918
I think we found our fugitive
and it's not a monster.

292
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,395
No.

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,557
This is something much, much worse.

294
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,914
This, chaps, is no ordinary diary.

295
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,634
It's an agent of Brigid.

296
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,355
Brigid.

297
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,035
The Celtic goddess
of art, creation and healing.

298
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,273
This book has the power
to make the imagination

299
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,159
a reality.

300
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,870
You're not film producers, are you?

301
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,158
No, we are not, but we saw
what was on that film, Ishiro,

302
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,714
and we're here to stop it.

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Tell us how you found the journal.

304
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,317
I was out scouting for my film.

305
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,116
- And I found this book.
- You didn't find the book,

306
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,270
it found you.

307
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,279
It's drawn to creative types.

308
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,755
Once I opened it,

309
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,711
I was flooded with inspiration.

310
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,518
An image that has haunted my nightmares

311
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,316
suddenly came to life on those pages.

312
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
And then,

313
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,114
to my horror,

314
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
in real life.

315
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
I told you,

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,230
- this book is evil.
- Whoa, hold on a tick.

317
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,520
Brigid created this book
as a gift to you humans,

318
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,798
to bring your dreams to life,
you turned it into a weapon.

319
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,760
She's right.

320
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,076
I did create something horrible.

321
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,920
- What is this thing?
- I call it Tagumo.

322
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,472
A giant land octopus.

323
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,999
Capable of destroying entire cities.

324
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,271
When I realized Tagumo had come to life,

325
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,511
I tried to destroy the journal.

326
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,558
But it always comes back.

327
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,439
Of course it does,
the power links you and this book.

328
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,232
It won't be released
until the story of your creation

329
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,879
is played out in full.

330
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,310
How did you end it?

331
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,198
You pushed the octopus in a volcano?

332
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,475
Nope.

333
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,152
Tagumo wins.

334
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,717
Tokyo is destroyed.

335
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh, brother.

336
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Richard.

337
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,079
You break it, you bought it, Rich.

338
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,312
Well, this is a disaster.

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,357
Hey, no one has killed each other, yet.

340
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,717
Chris, Tyson.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,151
- Dad, have you seen the boys?
- Oh, last I saw 'em,

342
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,515
they were down in the basement.

343
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,598
Playing with Nate's old air rifle.

344
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,274
Ooh!

345
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Mom!

346
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,080
Guess they know how to load it.

347
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,714
Okay, if we can't stop Tagumo,

348
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,155
then draw a new ending.

349
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,074
Preferably one where no one dies.

350
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,794
It's not working.

351
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,634
Like I said, Brigid created that book
to help artists express themselves.

352
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,816
You can't expect him to write
a happy ending

353
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,240
if he ain't had a happy life.

354
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,359
Ain't that right, Ishiro?

355
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,635
You're right.

356
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,029
Every night,

357
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,477
before this journal came to me,

358
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,153
I'd close my eyes,

359
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
and be back

360
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,277
in the ruins of Hiroshima.

361
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,595
Choking on ash,
wondering where all the people went.

362
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,237
Not realizing they were all around me,

363
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
in my hair,

364
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,120
on my clothes,

365
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,035
in my lungs.

366
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,833
They turned to dust.

367
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,272
Drawing Tagumo

368
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,510
helped me

369
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,672
turn the nightmares
into something I could understand.

370
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
A monster.

371
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,355
But now,

372
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
I am the monster.

373
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,873
Ishiro, you went through
something truly unimaginable.

374
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,879
We all deal with our pain
in different ways

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,155
and you chose art.

376
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,434
And that's beautiful.

377
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,794
Don't blame yourself.

378
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,914
This is not your fault.

379
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,919
So, can you save him?

380
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,439
Life force is the most potent
form of energy in the universe.

381
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,194
And you're like a battery
about to run out of charge.

382
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,399
But you already knew that, didn't you?

383
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,914
Oh, aye.

384
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,719
Then why didn't you say anything?

385
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
What?

386
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,078
And help push you off the wagon?

387
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,194
You're clean, Nora,
it's best we keep you that way.

388
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,949
You can recharge him, right?

389
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,554
You don't want me to do that, Ray.

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,240
Yes, I do.

391
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,277
- Otherwise, he's gonna die.
- Ray!

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,638
My power comes from my father.

393
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
It's in my blood,

394
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,216
it's always going to be calling me,
wanting me to give in

395
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,072
and be consumed, but I can't give in.

396
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I won't.

397
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,030
Now, this is where
we monitor timezone infractions.

398
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,430
Isn't that a little overkill?

399
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,150
Now here at the Time Bureau,
there's no such thing as overkill.

400
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,511
You need to come with me.
Come, come, come.

401
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,752
There's something else
amazing to see right in here.

402
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,994
- Um, why are you...
- Yeah.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,390
Oh! Uh, Mr. Green?

404
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,076
Hello? I think you forgot
to unlock the door.

405
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,074
I'm so fired.

406
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,481
Sorry to bother you but we have
a bit of a situation here.

407
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,757
<i>The prisoners are loose.</i>

408
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,036
- What? How the hell did that happen?
- Oh.

409
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
The tranqs must have worn off.

410
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,392
- Okay, we need to go.
- No, if we leave,

411
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,616
Hank will know something's wrong.

412
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Something is wrong, Nate.

413
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,236
So you want our liaison to the DOD
knowing that we messed up?

414
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,357
- No, I don't.
- What do I do?

415
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,954
- Shut up, Gary.
- Shut up, Gary.

416
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,031
I got a plan. I'll be back.

417
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,998
No, your family's gonna notice
if you're gone.

418
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,560
Not if I courier back ASAP.

419
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,438
- No.
- Just stall.

420
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,473
- Stall.
- No, I don't even know...

421
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,634
Hey, buddy, you okay?

422
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,136
This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

423
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,799
Yeah, it's scary stuff.

424
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,673
- Yeah.
- But like I said, I have a plan,

425
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,831
so let's go get our hands
on some tranq guns.

426
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,317
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

427
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,078
- Is that a Kaupe?
- No.

428
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,216
What the hell is she doing here?

429
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,016
She was supposed to stay
locked in the closet,

430
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,096
I was gonna flash her later.

431
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,032
- Do what?
- That didn't sound right.

432
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,190
Oh, for the love of...

433
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,919
Excellent hiding spot.

434
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,719
Yeah, well, I'm not hiding.

435
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,716
My father sacrificed himself
to give me a second chance.

436
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,756
I don't wanna ruin it
by backsliding into dark magic.

437
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,879
Who says it has to be dark?

438
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,391
John needs a magical transfusion.

439
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,511
Normally, I'd have to drain
someone's life to save his.

440
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,396
Life force is essentially energy.

441
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,433
- Right?
- Yeah.

442
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
Well, then I have an idea.

443
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Yes.

444
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,879
Oh, Dot, you have outdone yourself.

445
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,395
I hope you all built up an appetite.

446
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,630
Uh...

447
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,117
Care to do the honors
this year, Nathaniel?

448
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,234
- Nathaniel?
- Oh, he's probably just in the restroom.

449
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,795
We should wait for him.

450
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,151
Mom, I'm hungry.

451
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,709
- Me, too.
- Just a little bit longer, boys.

452
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Yeah, I'll go check on him.

453
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,031
Oh, wait, uh, sorry, sir.

454
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,656
- You know what we would do?
- In my family,

455
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,416
we'd actually go around
and list all the things

456
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
that we're thankful for.

457
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,318
What a lovely idea.

458
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,551
I'm thankful I'm still breathing.

459
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
Well, I'll go first then.

460
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,399
Uh, I am thankful for so many things.

461
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,678
So many, many things.

462
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,195
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here,

463
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,033
this is like the coolest place ever.

464
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,910
Wait.

465
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,074
I've seen this before.

466
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,994
They're hangry. Those poor creatures
are starving to death.

467
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,710
What does a Kaupe, chupacabra
and a Baba-Yaga eat?

468
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,235
That'd be Hawaiian barbecue,
birria, and veal.

469
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,516
Babies more precisely,
but veal will do in a pinch.

470
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Really?

471
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,796
- I read a lot.
- Wow.

472
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,696
Where are we going to get
all those things on Thanksgiving?

473
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,816
- Everything's closed.
- I'm on it.

474
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,069
No, get back here.

475
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,472
Ishiro can't change the story.

476
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,195
Plan C, it is.

477
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,511
What if we got the book
to bond with another artist?

478
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
We could change the story altogether.

479
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
Do you see another artist around?

480
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,149
It's not like we can just find
some rando with a paintbrush.

481
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,754
Who knows what they could unleash?

482
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,760
And we're sure there's not
a single artist amongst us?

483
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,832
Why don't we just burn the damn thing?

484
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,080
Hey, why don't you tell
Sara you're a writer?

485
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,276
Because I'm not.

486
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,073
Rory, I read your novel,
as much as it pains me to say it,

487
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,553
you are very, very talented.

488
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,196
Well, it doesn't matter,
I can't write anymore.

489
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,109
Nothing comes out.

490
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,470
You have writer's block.

491
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,029
No, I dropped a deuce this morning.

492
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,793
Ugh.

493
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Um, guys...

494
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,549
What is happening?

495
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,911
The Tagumo, it's headed straight for us.

496
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,712
It's moving fast. It's getting closer.

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,553
- By land?
- It's in the sewers.

498
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,756
Like an octopus.

499
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,355
Tagumo can squeeze through
the tiniest opening.

500
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,550
It's coming for me.

501
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,633
We're not gonna let that happen.
Rory, Z, keep him safe.

502
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,949
Charlie, with me.

503
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,916
Well, what's the plan?

504
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,376
You distract it, I'll shrink it down.

505
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,393
What? You want me as bait?
Not bloody likely.

506
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,039
Charlie! Damn it.

507
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,636
Oh.

508
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,679
Get your slimy mitts off of her,
you wanker!

509
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,076
Yeah!

510
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,595
Come on over here, you muppet,
come and get me.

511
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,915
Yeah!
Bloody brilliant!

512
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,192
Aren't you glad that I came back?

513
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,076
Where'd it go?

514
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Sara, how's it going out there?

515
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,313
<i>Good news, we shrank Tagumo.</i>

516
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,710
Bad news, we have no idea where it went.

517
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,596
Des...

518
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,476
Nora, don't.

519
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,016
- Don't talk, save your strength.
- No, listen to me, listen to me.

520
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,556
As smart as Ray is, he doesn't
understand what you're about to do.

521
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,152
Choosing a life of magic,
you're either all in

522
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,776
or you're not, there's no half measures.

523
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,476
And you and I both know,
it never leads to a happy ending.

524
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,513
So if you're gonna do this,

525
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,399
you don't do it for Ray,
you don't do it for me,

526
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,199
you do it for yourself, all right?

527
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,999
It's your choice.

528
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,158
It's your choice. It's your choice.

529
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,317
And I am thankful for
the Whole Paycheck Grocer by my work.

530
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,834
Did you know they have a full bar?

531
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,596
And I think you mentioned everything
the rest of us are thankful for.

532
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,478
So everyone please grab a plate.

533
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Oh!

534
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,192
- We should say grace, right?
- Grace!

535
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,798
- I'll check on Nathaniel.
- That... Just...

536
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,552
Why couldn't I just tell sober,
grounded stories

537
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,997
instead of indulging in silly monsters.

538
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,633
Sober and grounded is boring.

539
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,536
You had a story to tell and you told it,

540
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,279
you brought that monster to life.

541
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,036
Don't pretend for a second
you're not a little bit proud.

542
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,354
I was so afraid of what people
would think of my creation.

543
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,315
And now that it's here in the flesh...

544
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,394
Story complete.

545
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,277
And I no longer have to fear

546
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,310
what was locked inside my head.

547
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,436
No.

548
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,269
No, you don't.

549
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Pen.

550
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,155
The ink. It's not disappearing.

551
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,435
Are you ready?

552
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,476
Yes.

553
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,114
I wanna do this.

554
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Oh, what a rush.

555
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,136
Mona's here with the food.

556
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,719
Listen...

557
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,679
Oh, crap.

558
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Come on out, son, time to eat.

559
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,856
You know, maybe we should
start without him,

560
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm sure he'll be out soon enough.

561
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,720
Ha, look at that, maybe he went
to the store to grab some Pepto

562
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,836
for, you know...

563
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,350
I'm going to ask you this once,
Director Sharpe,

564
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,954
what are you hiding from me?

565
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,200
The prisoners have escaped, sir.

566
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,870
My son is alone with those
creatures on the loose?

567
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,917
- You take me there now.
- Sir, it's not safe.

568
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,231
My son is not safe, Director Sharpe.

569
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,471
We're going, end of discussion.

570
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,393
What the hell is this?

571
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,840
Uh, dinner, the key
to any hangry creature's heart.

572
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,400
We let them fill up and then it's...

573
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,358
Night-night again.

574
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,080
This time without
the life-threatening shenanigans.

575
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,989
<i>Senor,</i> I couldn't find the Tapatío,

576
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,560
but here's some Sriracha.

577
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,199
- What are you doing?
- Quiet. I'm concentrating.

578
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,078
Mick is a writer,

579
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,753
the journal has bonded with him.

580
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,797
Bloody hell! That's it, we're doomed.

581
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,519
We cannot stay here.

582
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,200
Tagumo will find us.

583
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,996
Ishiro!

584
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,951
Meet Garima.

585
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,470
Queen of Thanzanon.

586
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,196
- Should we help her?
- No, I think she's got it.

587
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,035
Get it, girl!

588
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,319
- Whoo!
- Wow.

589
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,550
Yeah!

590
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,549
It's beautiful.

591
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,919
Hi, I'm Mick.

592
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,870
"With the monster vanquished,
Garima and her beloved Buck

593
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,476
"made passionate love
in the ruins of the city."

594
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,797
Okay, let's go, now.

595
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,636
Where is everyone?

596
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,396
Your compatriots grew tired of waiting.

597
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,317
Hm, sorry about that,
got a bit messy in there.

598
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,752
I'm gonna take this with me.

599
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,069
Oh, please.

600
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,353
It clearly likes you.

601
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,238
Your creation was magnificent.

602
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,312
I was thinking about a fourth boob.

603
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,674
Three was plenty.

604
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,035
Huh. Listen, Honda-san.

605
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,952
Forget about the octopus.

606
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,792
Lizards. Lizards are king.

607
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,473
This girl can drink.

608
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,875
Care for a nip?

609
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,557
I know it won't quite
make up for the bottle...

610
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,479
Bottles that I pillaged.

611
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,951
- It's a start.
- Look,

612
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,677
wasn't too keen on what
you were doing out there.

613
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,873
Hunting fugitives,

614
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,272
but if someone's got to play copper,

615
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,990
it is a small comfort
knowing that she has a heart.

616
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,871
Don't tell the others,
they'll never listen to me again.

617
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,710
I should've known you'd have
an eye for talent.

618
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,075
Just like your old man.

619
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,994
Your creature handler, she's great.

620
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,197
Oh, yeah, she's gonna...

621
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,120
She's gonna fit right in.

622
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,796
Hey, look, Nate.

623
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,077
I just wish you'd
told me what was going on.

624
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,800
Honestly, I thought I could put out
the fire before anyone noticed.

625
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,554
Ah. Now I know how you must've felt
all those times

626
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,240
you had to duck out of
family gatherings.

627
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,229
You're the guy they called
if there was a disaster.

628
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,599
And I may have also been looking
for a way to get out of the house.

629
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,000
You old so-and-so.

630
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,310
Sir.

631
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,757
I know what you're thinking,
but I can assure you

632
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,354
that this will never happen again.

633
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,910
You're damn right it won't.

634
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,080
I'm gonna green light additional funding

635
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,755
to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.

636
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,235
Well, thank you so much, sir,
that will help a lot.

637
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,232
And your mother is gonna kill us.

638
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,510
Not necessarily.

639
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Perks of time travel.

640
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,555
We can portal back into
the second after we left.

641
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,035
That's fantastic.

642
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,589
Yeah.

643
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,433
Let's make like a tree and leave.

644
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,716
Hm, not sure that's how it goes, but...

645
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,350
How are you feeling?

646
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,920
Hunky-dory, love.

647
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,232
Hell, in fact I feel like
I have a new lease on life.

648
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,635
How are you feeling?

649
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Better.

650
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,070
Huh.

651
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,720
You know, my whole life,

652
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,951
I always believed my power was evil.

653
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,797
And then my dad died,
and I feared using it.

654
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,875
But...

655
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,513
I saved you, and for
the first time in my life,

656
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,679
my magic doesn't scare me.

657
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,315
Good.

658
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,755
John,

659
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,875
that man I saw.

660
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,314
Who was he?

661
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,789
The past.

662
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,440
Ray.

663
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,716
Hey, cheers, big man.

664
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,437
And now I'm gonna go and satiate
my most wonderful habit,

665
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,670
and have a smoke.

666
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
What?

667
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,714
No, no, don't ruin it.
We just cured you.

668
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,275
I can't believe that worked.

669
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,236
- Well, I, for one...
- Always wanna see the best in people.

670
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,709
Even me.

671
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Yeah.

672
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,240
I should be on my way.

673
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,676
Yeah.

674
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,229
- Okay.
- Okay.

675
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Um...

676
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,150
Run as far as you can,
don't tell me when or where,

677
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,277
just go and stay hidden.

678
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,952
But your team will know you let me go.

679
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,232
- Again.
- I don't care about that,

680
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,959
I care about you.

681
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,560
And I want you to be free.

682
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,416
This is the Time Bureau.
Nora, what are you doing?

683
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,760
You gotta get of here.

684
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,990
I can't keep running.

685
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,679
You want me to be free?

686
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,194
Repentance is my path to freedom.

687
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,158
It's time for me to pay for my past.

688
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,271
Nora Darhk, hands up.

689
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,309
Get on the ground.

690
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,955
Get on the ground!

691
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,352
"Garima was as strong
as she was stunning,

692
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,917
"and with her by his side,

693
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,831
"Buck had at last
vanquished his true enemy.

694
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,835
"Fear."

695
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Huh.

696
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,197
It's okay, Dad, take it.

697
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,630
Take it.

698
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,437
Look at this.

699
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,999
Thanks for getting back to me.

700
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,072
I know it's hard to get away
during the holiday.

701
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,238
These creatures are controllable,
I've seen it.

702
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,071
I don't care how much it costs,
we're going to make this happen.

703
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,835
Project Hades is go.
