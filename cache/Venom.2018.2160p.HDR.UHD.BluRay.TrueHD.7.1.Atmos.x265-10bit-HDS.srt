1
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,707
Life Foundation Control, this is LF1.

2
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,344
The specimens are secured,
and we're heading home.

3
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,763
Roger, LF1.
You are a go for reentry.

4
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,641
Copy that.
Initiating reentry sequence.

5
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,726
Point-four by 103-point...

6
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,478
- Oh, shit.

7
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,063
Seal it off. Seal it off!

8
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,290
LF1, Mission Control.

9
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,691
You're breaking up. Please repeat.

10
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,526
Mayday, Mayday, LF1!

11
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,736
- Mayday!
LF1, Mission Control.

12
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,530
Please repeat.

13
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,032
LF1, Mission Control. Please repeat.

14
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,518
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

15
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,894
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

16
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,087
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

17
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,811
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

18
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,608
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

19
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,010
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

20
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,555
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

21
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,557
It's 20 kilometers west of Sibu.

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,809
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

23
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,519
No. We have three of them.

24
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,521
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

25
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,691
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

26
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,617
What is she saying?

27
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,917
One of the astronauts is still alive.

28
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,840
That's Jameson.

29
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,176
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

30
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,552
I'm awake.

31
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,013
Missed me.

32
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,473
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

33
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,236
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

34
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,978
Oh, wow, you're wearing a suit. Yes!

35
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,355
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,733
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

37
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,068
Hey, let me know how your meeting goes.

38
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,612
My meeting?

39
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,447
Oh, shit. Yeah.

40
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,407
My meeting.

41
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,955
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

42
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,832
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,709
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

44
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,503
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

45
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,422
Mmm-hmm.
So, I will pick you up around, uh, 6:00.

46
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,966
And please do not forget your helmet.

47
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,426
Oh, I'm glad that you like it,

48
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,112
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

49
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,721
That's hot.

50
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,598
Feed the cat.

51
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,974
I will.

52
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,392
I love you!

53
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,144
Love you, too. Feed the cat.

54
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,399
I be the realest one alive

55
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,193
You don't want no problem

56
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,571
Take you down, it ain't
gonna be no problem, yeah

57
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,991
I get to feeling
like I'm high all my life

58
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,202
You ain't gonna want
these problems

59
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,080
Take you down,
ain't gonna be no problem...

60
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,957
Eddie Brock
with boots on the ground

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,417
today in the Mission District,
chasing a lead into some...

62
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,187
Everybody knows how
our Silicon Valley overlords

63
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,356
- at Google and Facebook...
- Last time, I was poking around

64
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,923
asking uncomfortable questions...

65
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,093
Homelessness is only increasing
into the thousands...

66
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,096
Eddie Brock here reporting
today from downtown Oakland,

67
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,224
where massive demonstrations
have taken over the streets.

68
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,685
I've been chasing
this real-estate bribery story

69
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,478
for a few weeks now.

70
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,843
- This is gonna piss you off.
- All being strong-armed...

71
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,066
Medical examiner has yet
to determine cause of death,

72
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,526
due to the condition of the body,

73
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,362
but you don't wind up
at the bottom of a landfill

74
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,532
due to natural causes,
so it seems that the city

75
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,119
doesn't care about these people
any more than the Killer does.

76
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,038
I'm Eddie Brock,
and this is The Brock Report.

77
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,790
Hey, Richard!

78
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,376
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

79
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,461
Come on, man.
There's no such thing as can't.

80
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,838
How'd she do?

81
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,757
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

82
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,819
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

83
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,386
You told me what?

84
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,388
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

85
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,765
The bike.

86
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,226
MIT! Whoo!

87
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,606
You know what I love about this view?

88
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,400
- It never gets old.
Yeah, well, uh...

89
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,236
Height's not really my thing.

90
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,697
But, uh... What's the deal?

91
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,158
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

92
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,701
Carlton Drake.

93
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,703
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

94
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,997
He wants to talk about his rockets,

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,625
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

96
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,084
Uh...

97
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,086
He's... He's seriously off.

98
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,713
I'm gonna level with you.

99
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,215
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

100
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,510
turn this building into his own garage
if he so wished.

101
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,513
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

102
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,099
you're gonna thank him,
and you're gonna bid him a nice day.

103
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,311
He's a crook.

104
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,191
Eddie, when you had nowhere to go,
we gave you a home.

105
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,443
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

106
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,321
There isn't a better
investigative reporter working today,

107
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,781
but no one is above the network.

108
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,117
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

109
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,744
All right, all right.

110
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,664
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

111
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,851
I don't know why he gave me
this assignment, Annie.

112
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,543
It's not... It's not what I do.

113
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,771
Well, my mother always told me

114
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:26,173
that anything in life worth having
would take sacrifice...

115
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,466
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

116
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,551
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

117
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,261
- Oh.
- That's you...

118
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,905
- That's not.
- That I'm talking about.

119
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,972
- Nah.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,349
Well, you're lucky to have me.

121
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,351
To be fair, I'm quite a catch.

122
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,645
That's what my mom told me.

123
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,730
Are you gonna behave yourself tomorrow?

124
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,025
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

125
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,111
I can't, you know, not do my job.

126
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,946
The guy you work for is a complete...

127
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,031
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

128
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,574
and my firm works for him.

129
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,160
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

130
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,288
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

131
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,999
- A repeat?
- Of the Daily Globe incident.

132
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,584
Ow! Really?

133
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,354
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

134
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,855
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

135
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,357
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

136
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,717
No, I still have currency in New York.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,094
I was going places.

138
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,178
I wasn't running.

139
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,930
I was going places.

140
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,724
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

141
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,560
- Me?
- You are my home.

142
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,563
You're not so bad yourself, champ.

143
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,068
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

144
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,403
Let's just get the check.

145
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,739
You

146
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,157
Oh

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,492
You are my lady

148
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,077
Ooh, ooh

149
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,788
I am your man

150
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,126
Some call it crazy

151
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,711
Ooh, ooh

152
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,297
They don't understand

153
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,175
Our love...

154
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,141
I'm gonna get a drink.

155
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,728
- Shh.

156
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,372
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

157
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,833
will be sent on an exploratory mission.

158
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,169
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

159
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,797
- Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

160
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,966
some of the cool stuff that we do here,

161
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,301
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

162
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,554
to go out there
and create things that others

163
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,806
- have only dreamt of.
Mr. Drake?

164
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,892
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

165
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,811
Come here. What's your name?

166
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,813
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

167
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,606
You know,
sometimes that's what people do.

168
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,192
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

169
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,278
But you know what? In the end,

170
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,197
we're the ones who change the world.

171
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,117
Take good care of that, Allie.

172
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,827
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

173
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,287
- Say hi.
Hi.

174
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,538
Hello, kids.

175
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,582
Um, sorry to interrupt,

176
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,792
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

177
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,044
Yeah. Uh, kids, sorry to leave you.

178
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,422
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

179
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,758
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's question,
and any others.

180
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,695
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
Bye!

181
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,637
What do you say, Mr. Drake,

182
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,598
we just start at the beginning?

183
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,683
- Born to British parents.
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,061
And then at 19,
you discovered a gene therapy

185
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,814
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

186
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,500
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

187
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,526
it tripled their life expectancy.

188
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,111
But it's okay.

189
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,156
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

190
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,158
All right, you create

191
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,844
- The Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

192
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,620
And then... Rockets.

193
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,663
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

194
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,665
that you're gonna go and explore space.

195
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,043
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

196
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,794
- Uh-huh.
- That space exploration

197
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,588
is crucial in our quest to cure

198
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,506
everything that ails us here on Earth.

199
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,026
But if you think about
everything we've found...

200
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,569
- Uh-huh.
- In the oceans and on land,

201
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,428
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

202
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,805
To this plethora of untapped resources?

203
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,491
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

204
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,184
from your pharmaceutical companies

205
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,037
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

206
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,288
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

207
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,647
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

208
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,774
So, I have to ask, how does that work,

209
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,585
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

210
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,527
How does it... How does it, um...

211
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,404
I don't know, how does it go about,

212
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,532
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
Eddie, we're talking

213
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,385
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

214
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,328
I'm talking about the allegations.

215
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,889
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

216
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,456
your entire empire has been built

217
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,541
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

218
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,835
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

219
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,088
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

220
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,506
- Hmm.
- That more often than not

221
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,590
end up killing people.

222
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,300
Yeah, I'm aware of these rumors online.

223
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,861
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

224
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,345
Right. What about the legal cases?

225
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,596
Sorry?

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,974
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

227
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,743
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
That's it. Time to go.

228
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,370
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

229
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,621
And they're just some
of the people who walked

230
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,872
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

231
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,207
- Cut the camera off, please.
Thank you very much.

232
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,500
Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

233
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,960
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

234
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,461
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

235
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,545
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

236
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,196
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

237
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,531
Is that a threat?

238
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,741
Have a nice life.

239
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,163
I know what you're going to say, but...

240
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,749
This guy, he is all the way bad, Jack.

241
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,793
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

242
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,546
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

243
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,845
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

244
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,805
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

245
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,725
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

246
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,184
We do the work.

247
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,812
We substantiate our accusations.

248
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,897
We provide evidence.

249
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,317
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumb-ass.

250
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,242
You're fired, Eddie.

251
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,244
I can't trust you.

252
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,788
Have a nice life.

253
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,832
Will just take a second.
Okay.

254
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,418
Hey.

255
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,004
You are pathologically self-absorbed.

256
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,065
- Annie. Annie, can you talk to me first?
- Your ego requires constant attention,

257
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,549
and you're stubborn as hell.

258
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,427
But I was willing to roll with it,
Eddie, because I loved you.

259
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,721
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

260
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,767
What you did got me fired.

261
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,561
You used me.

262
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,613
Annie? Annie.

263
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,147
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,319
You're beautiful.

265
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,271
Test 36.

266
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,814
Biological interactions

267
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,108
- between two different organisms.

268
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,861
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

269
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,905
in order to survive
for any amount of time

270
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,698
in an oxygen-rich environment.

271
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,991
Well, why are all these hosts

272
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,660
showing this hyper-acute rejection?

273
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,703
That's what
we're trying to find out.

274
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,999
The bonding process is starting.

275
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,381
It's equalizing.

276
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,390
But why? Why this rabbit?

277
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,017
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

278
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,937
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

279
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,398
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

280
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,235
If we do achieve symbiosis,
they should be able to survive here,

281
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,446
but also we would
be able to survive there.

282
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,241
_llWell?

283
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,410
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

284
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,971
to even begin to think
about something like...

285
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,973
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

286
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,291
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

287
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,054
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

288
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,006
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

289
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,879
Hey, how are your kids?

290
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,216
Let's begin human trials.

291
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,467
Good work.

292
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,033
Hey, Jack.

293
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,911
Do you ever feel like your life

294
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,457
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

295
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,976
Here at the Life Foundation,

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,169
- we've always believed...
- Isn't that your buddy?

297
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,604
In finding the lessons
in our disappointments.

298
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,380
In the months since our rocket failed,

299
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,049
we've learned so much.

300
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,384
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

301
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,678
Some people are trying to watch that.

302
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,096
Oh, you are, are you?

303
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,640
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

304
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,518
I used to be.

305
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,312
We take the same view
of progress.

306
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,482
Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation

307
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,443
has now begun preparations
on its next launch.

308
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,944
All right, Jack, this is for you.

309
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,905
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

310
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,008
I'm going to go home
and chase myself around the room,

311
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,450
playing hard to get.

312
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,289
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

313
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,833
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

314
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,169
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

315
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,298
Cost you $5.

316
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,467
$5 for a paper that's free?

317
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,470
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

318
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,222
got the papers out
and brought 'em back over here,

319
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,808
SO you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

320
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,892
You did that for me?

321
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,477
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

322
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,189
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

323
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,025
Tell you what,
you give me a dollar for a song,

324
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,151
I'll throw in the paper.

325
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,279
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

326
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,948
but not to sing, all right?

327
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,491
Deal.

328
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,451
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

329
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,912
- No. You're welcome.

330
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,624
- Hey, Mrs. Chen.

331
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,960
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

332
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,420
you know, aches and pains.

333
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,255
You look like shit.

334
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,424
Excuse me?

335
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,967
You look like shit.

336
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,138
And you look as beautiful as ever.

337
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,807
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

338
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,535
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

339
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,703
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

340
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,872
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

341
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,066
because I bought a DVD off your cousin,
and it was in Mandarin.

342
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,819
- Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

343
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,547
See, that right there,
I don't understand what you just said.

344
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,697
That is the problem.

345
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,538
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

346
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,540
Please.

347
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,167
Let's go.

348
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,930
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

349
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,047
The full payment is due.

350
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,257
Now.

351
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,177
Make sure you have my money ready, Chen.

352
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,887
I don't like to wait.

353
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,239
Life hurts, Eddie.

354
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,241
It just does.

355
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,135
I gotta go.

356
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,515
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

357
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,936
And the state it put him in

358
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,229
What a dick.

359
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:38,775
To hold his head high

360
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:43,571
When he really wanna die

361
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,282
And you know

362
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:52,580
The difference it makes

363
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,710
And you know

364
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,714
All that it takes

365
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,633
Is love...

366
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,426
I'm not even asking to staff there.

367
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,110
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

368
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,346
I can use a pseudonym.

369
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,931
Any name. Think... You pick a name.

370
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,016
I could be a woman.
Have you seen Tootsie?

371
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,142
He won't break

372
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,063
Won't break...

373
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,898
I'll call you back.

374
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,817
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

375
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:31,202
Realize deeply that
the present moment is all you ever have.

376
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,331
Make the now
the primary focus of your life.

377
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,418
Any action is often better
than no action,

378
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,211
especially if you have been stuck

379
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,172
in an unhappy situation for a long time.

380
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,884
If it is a mistake,
at least you learned something,

381
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,428
in which case it's no longer...

382
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,276
Thank you all
for bringing us to this moment.

383
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:14,662
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

384
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,956
History starts now.

385
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,292
This is day one.

386
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,419
This is first contact.

387
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,006
- Let's get to work.

388
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,355
Establishing subject baseline.

389
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,525
All vital signs are normal.

390
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,950
- Put me through.

391
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,244
There's no need to be frightened, Isaac.

392
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,915
There's no need.

393
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,959
Isaac. You know that's a biblical name?

394
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,544
Yes, sir.

395
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,172
God said to Abraham, "Give me your son,

396
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,841
"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing

397
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,053
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

398
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,198
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

399
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,308
It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.

400
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,649
Now, I don't know what kind of God
would ask that of someone,

401
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,001
but it doesn't change anything for me.

402
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,862
Isaac is still the hero of this story.

403
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,074
Look around you. Look at the world.

404
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,284
What do you see? War, poverty,

405
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,495
a planet on the brink of collapse.

406
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:40,123
I would argue that God has abandoned us.

407
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,226
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

408
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,585
So now it's down to you and me
to put this right.

409
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,922
And this time, Isaac, we can.

410
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,678
We will.

411
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:57,014
This time, I will not abandon us.

412
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,518
Yes.

413
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,397
Open it.

414
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,412
What the hell is that? What? No, what...

415
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,080
Please let me... No.

416
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,582
Oh, please, please, please!

417
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,363
His vitals are holding steady.

418
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,730
Where the hell did it go?
Incredible.

419
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,648
Where did it go?

420
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,780
Where is it?

421
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,236
Bring in the next volunteer.

422
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,851
You know, I used to be a reporter.

423
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,352
I was...

424
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,980
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

425
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:13,234
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

426
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:18,406
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

427
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,824
I mean...

428
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,201
You have to know how to disappear.

429
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,372
I was pretty good, but, you know, you...

430
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,208
Whoever you are, you suck.

431
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,419
Okay.

432
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,171
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

433
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,298
I need your help.

434
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,216
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

435
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,885
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

436
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,136
We're done.

437
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,179
- No...

438
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,808
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

439
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,894
Everything that you accused him of,

440
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,177
you were right. It's all true.

441
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,521
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

442
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,815
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

443
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,234
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

444
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,028
and he's using them like guinea pigs,

445
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,529
and they are dying.

446
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,157
They are all dying.

447
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,783
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

448
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:04,994
Come here.

449
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,205
Why would I believe you?

450
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,415
Because it's true.

451
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,125
I believed in him, and I...

452
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,044
I told myself that it was worth it

453
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,272
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

454
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,714
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

455
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,049
I can't do that.

456
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,693
I'm afraid of what will happen
to my family.

457
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,695
He's a very dangerous man,
and he's a very powerful man...

458
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,137
I know, I know how dangerous he is,

459
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,865
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

460
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,058
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

461
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,518
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

462
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,229
I lost my apartment,
I lost everything I ever cared about.

463
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,690
You know why?
Carlton Drake ruined me. Finished.

464
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,027
Now, if you are who you say you are,

465
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,695
genuinely, and you have proof,

466
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,074
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

467
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,700
I am.

468
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,596
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

469
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,704
because I am done.

470
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,414
I am done with all of this shit.

471
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,249
What shit?

472
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,586
All of this "saving my fellow man" shit.

473
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,129
All right? Good night.

474
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,358
Eddie?

475
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,777
Well, hey. Whoa.

476
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,822
Anne, I was just walking by, and, uh...

477
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,198
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

478
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,950
I felt concerned for his welfare, so...

479
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,368
Eddie...

480
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,120
This is Dan.

481
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,539
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

482
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,207
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

483
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,851
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

484
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,876
- Really?
- Yeah.

485
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,878
I'm a big fan of your work.

486
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,505
- Thank you.
- Really?

487
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,633
It's pretty cool,
all the people that he took down.

488
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,927
Yeah, I was one of them.

489
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,573
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

490
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,317
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

491
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,978
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

492
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,237
- He has a key. You know he has a key?

493
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,948
Yeah. How else would he get in?

494
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,328
Yeah. Well, uh...

495
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,831
So, uh, what you up to?

496
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,710
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

497
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,837
Hey, well, just asking, you know.

498
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,215
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

499
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,467
No, he's a doctor.

500
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,303
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

501
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,222
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

502
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,825
I would say that he misses you,

503
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,329
but that would be bullshit, 'cause...

504
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,162
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

505
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,621
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

506
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,814
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

507
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,125
What are you doing here, Eddie?

508
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,233
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

509
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,611
A lot.

510
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,676
You know, we were gonna get married.

511
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,823
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

512
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,079
I can't really believe
that we're not...

513
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,580
Are we gonna try and find our way back?

514
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,957
No, we can't.

515
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,128
You did this, Eddie.

516
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,758
Not Carlton Drake, not the network.

517
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:06,926
You.

518
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,036
Uh, hello. This is Dr. Skirth.

519
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,621
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

520
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,416
Talk to me.

521
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,046
Are you sure this is gonna work?

522
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,147
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

523
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,803
53.5, win-909 RPM.

524
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,518
Whew.

525
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:42,229
Overpopulation and climate change.

526
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,440
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

527
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,584
Yeah, got it, right.

528
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:49,445
We are literally a generation away
from an uninhabitable Earth.

529
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,239
Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

530
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:54,366
to scout real estate.

531
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,844
You know,
it's a really interesting story,

532
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,308
but we need to just get to the part
where he's killing people.

533
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,457
Drake sent a ship
oh a recon mission.

534
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,251
On the way back, they found a comet.

535
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,544
A comet?

536
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,715
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

537
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,693
Wait, wait, wait, when you say
"millions of organisms,”"

538
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,445
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

539
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,970
You're talking about aliens?

540
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,513
Like, aliens?

541
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,933
E.T. phone home.

542
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,017
Aliens, yeah.

543
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,977
- Yes.

544
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,355
But we don't call them that.

545
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,108
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

546
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,945
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

547
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:35,282
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

548
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,660
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

549
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:42,206
Drake is trying to put human beings
and aliens together?

550
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,083
So they can live in space?

551
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,626
We call them hosts.

552
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,379
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

553
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,506
Yes. There's no protocol for this thing.

554
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,840
He's just feeding them in.

555
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,676
If the match isn't exact...

556
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,484
Elevators patrol check.

557
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,391
Please, just go in.
Don't touch anything.

558
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,674
- I won't. I won't.
- Go, go, go. I'll take care of him.

559
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,438
Dr. Skirth.

560
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,898
I thought you'd all gone home.

561
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,401
Oh, yes. Well, you know what they say.

562
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,945
Science never sleeps.

563
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,515
- Eddie! It's me. Let me out!
- Maria? Maria?

564
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,285
- Please! Let me out!
- I don't know how to get you...

565
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,269
- Let me out. Out.
- I don't know how.

566
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,581
Oh, my God.

567
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:46,121
Oh, God! Maria, no! Maria!

568
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,374
Maria! No, Maria, no!

569
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,678
There has been
a security breach in Lab Sector 3.

570
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,097
Oh, no. Maria?

571
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,973
Maria! Oh, shit.

572
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,894
Repeat, this is
a Code Silver security breach.

573
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,317
Freeze!

574
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,475
Got eyes on!

575
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,741
Go!

576
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,076
Go! Go!

577
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,297
Where the hell'd he go?

578
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,980
I'm not seeing him.
- Fan out.

579
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,768
- Find him.
Nothing. Nothing yet.

580
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,887
Search Team 4, Search Team 4.

581
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,190
Backtrack 200 feet east.

582
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,088
This is Dora.
Leave a message.

583
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,198
Skirth, yeah, it's me. I just got back.

584
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,909
Are you all right?
I haven't heard from you,

585
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,535
so I want to know if you're all right.

586
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,370
But, yeah,
that was a great call on the lab.

587
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,830
You're absolutely right.

588
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,790
Yeah. Listen.

589
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,751
I got a... I got a guy.

590
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,003
I'm gonna call him and, uh...

591
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,714
Mmm. Oh...

592
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,175
Oh, I got a bunch of photographs.

593
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,653
He will publish those photographs,
but I need you to come with me.

594
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,721
Uh, could you just call me back?
Call me back.

595
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,394
Whoa.

596
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,080
- Yeah.

597
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,374
Mmm.

598
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,142
What is wrong with me?

599
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,543
Eddie.

600
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,203
How bad?

601
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,163
It's bad.

602
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,415
How bad?

603
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,209
Well, we assume the intruder took it.

604
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,088
Took it? Took it?

605
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,049
We don't know what happened.

606
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,903
I want to speak to every man
who was on duty last night.

607
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,071
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

608
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,263
Get it out of my sight.

609
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,974
- Carlton, you need to see this.
What now?

610
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,868
His blood pressure's
back to normal.

611
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,227
Liver functions, too.

612
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,440
I knew it.

613
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,984
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

614
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,965
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

615
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,449
- Okay?
Yeah.

616
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,660
Come on.

617
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,954
You're fired.

618
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,914
Find my Symbiote.

619
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,750
Now!

620
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,605
Jesus.

621
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,004
Attention,
passengers for Flight 2517

622
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,465
to San Francisco via Hong Kong.

623
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,719
We will be boarding
at gate 9 in 15 minutes.

624
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,721
Please have your boarding passes...

625
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,682
Suzy. Come on, over here.

626
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,026
May I speak to Annie Weying, please?

627
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,070
Can you tell her that it's an emergency?

628
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:11,613
Food.

629
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,615
Who said that?

630
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,701
No, I'm not talking to you.

631
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,453
Can you please tell me where she is?

632
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:22,040
Great. Thank you.

633
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,255
Okay...

634
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,052
Yes, Lana for two?

635
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,155
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

636
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,222
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.

637
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,783
Oh, my God, Eddie.
What are you doing here?

638
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:39,975
- Annie...
- No, no, no...

639
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,327
No, I have to tell you something.

640
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,829
- No, no, no. Please.
- No, now. I have to.

641
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,664
Work told me you were here.
You're the only person that I trust.

642
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:45,772
Are you drunk?

643
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,536
Yeah. No,
I broke into the Life Foundation.

644
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,085
- Eddie, you did what?
- Yeah, but I may...

645
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,378
I think I may have been infected.

646
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,546
He's burning up. You're really hot.

647
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,714
Eddie, you look like
you're in a bad way.

648
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,322
I am. I am in a bad way.

649
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,146
- Eddie, Jesus!

650
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,204
This is dead.

651
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,831
Dead.

652
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,499
Eddie, sit down.

653
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,585
- Okay, all right. Okay.

654
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:07,854
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

655
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,313
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

656
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,777
- Put it down. Eddie!

657
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,133
- Snap out of it!

658
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,011
No.

659
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,804
All right. It's no good.

660
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,347
Bobby, are you all right?

661
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,432
- Hey!
Whoa!

662
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,392
Hey, hey, hey.

663
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,556
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

664
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,938
I'm hot. Is anyone else hot?

665
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,190
Are you hurt?

666
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,483
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

667
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,918
Wait, where are you going? Eddie?

668
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,670
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

669
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,174
What are you doing? No, please don't.

670
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,614
- No.
- Eddie, please.

671
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:36,740
Oh, my God.

672
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,533
Ah.

673
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,682
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

674
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,066
Here, call an ambulance.
I'm a doctor. This man is my, um...

675
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,710
Patient.

676
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,629
Oh, it's much better.

677
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:51,814
You are insane.

678
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,608
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

679
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,008
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

680
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,235
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

681
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,470
- And I have proof!

682
00:43:58,762 --> 00:43:59,930
Ugh.

683
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,939
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

684
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,362
Eddie.

685
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:17,864
Eddie?

686
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,450
Eddie, can you hear me?

687
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:22,905
This is Dan speaking to you.

688
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:26,122
Hey, Dan.

689
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,333
- Welcome back.
Where am I?

690
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,668
Uh, you're in the MRI.

691
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,378
Okay, we've given you a little sedative.

692
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,089
- Where is Anne?
- Anne is not here right now.

693
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,632
We're gonna run some tests, okay?

694
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,026
It's gonna be completely painless.

695
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,530
So, you know, just try to stay still.

696
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,679
Uh, relax, and, um...

697
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:42,722
Yeah, here we go.

698
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,397
Eddie, what's happening in there?

699
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,606
Eddie, you okay?

700
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,571
Shut it down.

701
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,866
- Hey, hey, hey.

702
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,242
You're okay. Yeah.

703
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,035
Coming out. You all right?

704
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,972
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

705
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,414
- You okay?
- Yeah.

706
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,517
All right. Just take a deep breath.
Okay? You're okay.

707
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,001
- Yeah.

708
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,271
Now, listen, you're not
the first person to freak out in there.

709
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:15,005
I get claustrophobic, too.

710
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,423
Dr. Lewis?

711
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,842
Oh, boy. Hey, Mrs. Manfredi.
How are you?

712
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,552
- Oh, I just saw Morris.

713
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,680
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

714
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,700
Oh, good.
Oh, thank you so much.

715
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,726
Yeah, my pleasure.

716
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,603
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

717
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,163
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

718
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,772
- Sorry. Gemini.

719
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,625
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

720
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,335
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

721
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,503
I'll call you when your tests are in.

722
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,880
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

723
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,544
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

724
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,284
Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

725
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,678
Did you have the same reactions

726
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:47,162
regardless of the temperature...

727
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,791
Good afternoon, Dr. Skirth.

728
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:59,132
The creature
and the host are one.

729
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,216
Everything was fine.

730
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,470
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

731
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:06,473
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

732
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,891
But the organism is unaffected?

733
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,351
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

734
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,603
But once again, it's Killing the host.

735
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,729
It's consuming his organs.

736
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,315
Oh, watch this.

737
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:22,056
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

738
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,117
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

739
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,703
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
Okay.

740
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,790
He was stabilizing. What happened?

741
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,353
He's approaching acute liver failure.

742
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,460
We're gonna need another host.

743
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,545
Such poor design.

744
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,256
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

745
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,342
Sorry to interrupt.

746
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,763
Thought you'd like some good news.

747
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,723
I'm sorry.

748
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,777
Hungry!

749
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,237
Oh, goddamn.

750
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,823
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

751
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,908
Can I get through, please? Excuse me.

752
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,201
Thank you.

753
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,953
I'm just gonna stay here, all right?

754
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,747
Until the cable car stops.

755
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,713
We're good. All right. Thank you.

756
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,798
- Excuse me.

757
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,971
Oh, hey, Anne.

758
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,306
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

759
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,809
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

760
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,353
Well, Eddie, you have a parasite.

761
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,772
They're not exactly sure how you got it,

762
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,691
but it would explain the fever.

763
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:40,775
That would make sense.

764
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:44,821
Also, I'm hearing, uh, a voice.

765
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,966
Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.

766
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,366
Oh, hey, Dan. How you doing?

767
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,969
I didn't realize
that you were on the call, too.

768
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,786
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

769
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,580
Hey, Dan, would this parasite...

770
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,999
Would it, like, be able to make me,
I don't know...

771
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,169
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

772
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,212
but super, super fast?

773
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,922
Yes. We just did.

774
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,066
Uh, well, Eddie, it sounds like

775
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,134
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

776
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,487
that are making it hard
for your body to maintain homeostasis.

777
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,264
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

778
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,325
Listen, Eddie, um,
we are gonna get you on some meds,

779
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,410
and we are gonna clear that out.

780
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:16,144
- Yes.
Never gonna happen.

781
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,813
Will you stop doing that now. Not now.

782
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,708
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- I know.

783
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:23,068
I know. I'm just,
I'm not actually talking to you, Annie.

784
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,652
Who are you talking to?

785
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,529
I'm just gonna call you back, all right?

786
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,907
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

787
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,840
Yeah?

788
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,842
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

789
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,761
"Cause I'm having a really hard time.

790
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,137
Whatever.

791
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,350
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

792
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,873
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,066
I was troubled by

794
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,777
what we've been doing.

795
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,112
I get it.

796
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:08,947
I get it.

797
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,491
We've all been troubled.

798
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,035
It's the nature of what we do.

799
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:18,915
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

800
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:21,918
I need that from you.

801
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,297
I can't do that.

802
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,885
We can't fix things unless we begin with

803
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,012
your friend.

804
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,431
The person who was here.

805
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,515
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

806
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,853
You know that, right?

807
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,064
They're gonna die
unless we bring them back here,

808
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,483
where you can help to keep them alive.

809
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,071
Hey. Dora.

810
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,659
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

811
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,114
Will you trust me?

812
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,046
Eddie Brock.

813
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:08,965
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

814
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,143
You were our best.

815
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,187
Open it.

816
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,901
No! No!

817
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,944
No! No! No!

818
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,492
Do not open that door.

819
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,204
Huh?

820
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,259
Stay put.

821
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,779
- Hey, Eddie.
Who the hell is this guy?

822
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,555
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

823
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,641
- Whoa.

824
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,851
What are you doing?
- I'm, uh...

825
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,853
I'm putting my hands up.

826
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:06,147
You are making us look bad.

827
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,234
I... No, I am not.

828
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:10,735
Yes, you are.

829
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,487
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

830
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,113
- No, I'm not.
- Why would you do that?

831
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,865
"Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

832
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,368
- Eddie...
I will take care of this myself.

833
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,245
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

834
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,081
Take him down.

835
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,802
I'm so sorry about your friends.

836
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:47,063
- What is that?
Not "what." Who.

837
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,857
Oh.

838
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,243
Shit.

839
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,808
Outstanding.

840
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,519
Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.

841
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,645
Why would we do that?

842
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:30,481
Pile of bodies, pile of heads.

843
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,282
What the shit, man?

844
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,040
No! No, no, no!

845
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:55,715
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

846
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,842
Apparently, I have a parasite.

847
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:09,103
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

848
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,730
Connecting you to the feed now.

849
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,487
He's achieved symbiosis.

850
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,672
Are you seeing this?

851
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,115
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

852
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,951
Treece...

853
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,120
Treece, bring me back my creature.

854
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:35,755
Eddie.

855
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,725
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

856
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,394
It's not real. You're in my head.

857
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,312
"Cause you're just a parasite.

858
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,438
"Parasite"?

859
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,781
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

860
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,721
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

861
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,414
I am sorry that I called you a parasite.

862
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:11,457
We can discuss this like two men.

863
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,376
What is that? What is that?

864
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,219
What?

865
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,264
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

866
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,507
Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.

867
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,143
Launch the drones.

868
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,923
Duck.

869
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,302
Whew!

870
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,387
- Thank you.
You are welcome.

871
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,645
- Oh!

872
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,299
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

873
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,748
- Oh, God, no!

874
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,188
Holy shit!

875
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,781
Treece, do not let him get away.

876
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,450
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

877
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,750
Target is now eastbound on Grant.

878
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,503
Oh, God! Do something!

879
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,178
What the...

880
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:38,145
Oh, yeah! We got more friends. Awesome.

881
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:43,359
No, no, no! No, no!

882
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,691
No! You're out of your mind!

883
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:52,076
No!

884
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,848
- That is a dead-end!
Not for us.

885
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,602
Whoa!

886
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:24,817
- Yeah!

887
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:55,973
Whoa!

888
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,231
I am going to die!

889
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,608
You are not going to die!

890
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,081
Whoa! That was pretty cool, actually.
I'm not gonna lie...

891
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:30,508
I got him.

892
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,693
Bring him home.
- Copy that.

893
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,844
This is incredible.

894
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,020
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

895
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:46,148
Well, you know, I aim to please.

896
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,996
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

897
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,458
So many snacks, so little time.

898
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,679
SFPD. Don't move!

899
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,139
Get off the car!

900
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:35,906
My legs.

901
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,994
Oh, my God, my legs were broken.

902
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,580
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

903
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,597
What the hell are you?

904
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,640
I am Venom.

905
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,435
And you are mine.

906
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,354
You bit somebody's head off.

907
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,023
Fuel in the tank.

908
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,025
Listen carefully, Eddie.

909
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,819
You did not find us.

910
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:16,572
We found you.

911
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,616
Think of yourself as my ride.

912
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,700
Where are you going?

913
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,661
We need Carlton Drake's rocket.

914
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,413
You remember him.

915
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,499
How do you even know about that?

916
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,918
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

917
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,711
- Everything about you.
- How?

918
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,922
- I am inside your head.

919
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,299
You are a loser, Eddie.

920
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:43,140
Are you gonna eat anybody else?

921
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,517
Most likely.

922
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,851
Oh, God.

923
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:48,395
That is why we are here.

924
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,316
Cooperate, and you might just survive.

925
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,653
That is the deal.

926
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,425
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

927
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,909
Welcome to San Francisco.

928
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,203
For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...

929
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:26,851
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

930
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,734
Where's Eddie?
- Why? What's happening?

931
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,855
I got Eddie's labs back,

932
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,556
and it's worse than I thought.

933
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:37,403
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

934
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,547
I've never seen anything like it.

935
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,531
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

936
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,491
- You need to get him here.
- My God.

937
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,455
- Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.
- Shit.

938
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:57,840
Where were you
when it left Dr. Skirth's body?

939
01:01:58,299 --> 01:01:59,633
- Where was he?
- I was...

940
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:04,513
This is the higher life-form.
You stood by and watched while it died.

941
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:06,599
The arrogance.

942
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:16,483
Treece, listen to me.
After this, we can't risk killing Brock,

943
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,694
not until we find another suitable host.

944
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,239
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

945
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:30,039
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

946
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,392
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

947
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,476
It's not safe for you to be here, ma'am.

948
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,740
Found another one, Bill.

949
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,212
Get off the streets. Go home.

950
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:38,857
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

951
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:39,965
Bodies?

952
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,469
My God, Eddie, where are you?

953
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,223
Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.

954
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,225
That is none of your goddamn business.

955
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,728
Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.

956
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,104
We have no secrets.

957
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:56,041
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

958
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:57,425
before we get to your rocket, huh?

959
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,778
Sure. I'm not unreasonable.

960
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,780
Shit. Yeah?

961
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,799
Eddie. Thank God.
Where are you? I need to see you.

962
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,617
No, no, you can't see me.

963
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,845
Eddie, I need you to tell me
where you are. I'm coming to get you.

964
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:12,289
No, you cannot come anywhere near me.
You cannot come near me right now.

965
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,517
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
No!

966
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,602
- Eddie?
No, I gotta go up there.

967
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,853
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

968
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:17,957
I got to get up there, man.

969
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,339
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

970
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:23,592
- There's no such thing as can't.
- I'm sorry, man.

971
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,470
Okay, okay... Uh...

972
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,889
Can you, uh, just give him this?

973
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:32,101
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

974
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,478
Let's eat his brains.
- No! You do not touch him!

975
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:35,956
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

976
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,565
He works three jobs just so that
he can support his family.

977
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:39,876
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

978
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,026
"We"?
Yeah.

979
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,190
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

980
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:47,199
Yeah.

981
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,582
- Shit.
You want up?

982
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,714
Well, why didn't you just say?

983
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:13,809
Hmm.

984
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:17,479
- It is peaceful up here.
I'm not very good with heights.

985
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:21,692
Your world is not so ugly after all.

986
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,778
I'm almost sorry to see it end.

987
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:25,988
What does that mean?

988
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:35,956
Where'd you go? Where did you go?

989
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:48,135
I got us.

990
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:49,553
Whoa.

991
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:58,312
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

992
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,689
You die, I die.

993
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:02,941
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

994
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,569
and exchange it for another one
whenever you need.

995
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,237
Why would I do that?

996
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:10,032
You are far too good of a match
to throw away so soon.

997
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,659
Plus, I am starting to like you.

998
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:14,078
You and I are not so different.

999
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:15,913
Thank you.

1000
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,793
Okay.

1001
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,129
Here's your evidence.

1002
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,301
Jump.

1003
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,097
Pussy.

1004
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:44,817
Hands!

1005
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,403
On the ground! Now!

1006
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,619
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

1007
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,121
- Mask!
- Copy!

1008
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,331
All right, have it your own way.

1009
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,542
- Mask!
Copy.

1010
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,585
What the hell is that thing?

1011
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,384
What the hell?

1012
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:12,886
Hold your fire!

1013
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,346
Flares!

1014
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:16,449
He's there! He's there!

1015
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,724
Reload!

1016
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,394
Anybody see him?

1017
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:33,005
Does anyone have eyes on him?

1018
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:37,119
Switching to thermal.
Seeking target.

1019
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:52,426
I don't have eyes on him.

1020
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,262
Where is it?

1021
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:03,312
Flash grenade!

1022
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,814
- Throw them!

1023
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:06,899
Flash grenade!

1024
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,679
He's in the rafters!

1025
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:20,704
Above!

1026
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,127
There he is!

1027
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,217
Move, move, move!

1028
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,957
No! We do not eat policemen!

1029
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:12,798
- Annie! Annie, wait!

1030
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,601
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1031
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:17,177
That's not me. I've been infected.

1032
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,638
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1033
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,847
- "He"?
- Yes.

1034
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,225
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1035
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:26,520
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1036
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:31,608
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1037
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,321
Right now.

1038
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:42,244
I can't go with you. It's not safe.

1039
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,412
Get in the car, Eddie.

1040
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:48,625
- In the back.
I like her. Get in.

1041
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:57,843
I'm out of control.

1042
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:00,988
Dan just needs to do another MRI.

1043
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,848
No MRI.
- No. No. No MRI.

1044
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:04,558
What? Why?

1045
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,185
Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.

1046
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:12,065
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1047
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,360
What, so, sound is like his kryptonite?

1048
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:17,529
- Not all sounds.
And fire.

1049
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,241
- Fire. And fire.
- He's talking to you?

1050
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,286
Always.

1051
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,372
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1052
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,167
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1053
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,044
I'm hungry all the time.

1054
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:36,048
And you feel sad, do you not,
Eddie, when you are with her?

1055
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,675
Get out of my head, man.

1056
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,761
You never apologized.

1057
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,139
You might not live
to get another chance.

1058
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,104
Annie.

1059
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:55,108
I just want to say that
whatever happens,

1060
01:09:55,359 --> 01:10:01,114
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1061
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,116
I am truly, truly sorry.

1062
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:06,453
And that I love you.

1063
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:08,705
Oh, Eddie...

1064
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,751
Now's really not the time.
Let's just keep you alive, okay?

1065
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,295
Aw, that's nice.

1066
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:23,261
You know, I'm really wet and cold.
Can I, uh, wear this?

1067
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:26,348
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1068
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:27,849
Thank you.

1069
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:47,411
Hello?

1070
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:00,090
What are you doing here?

1071
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:04,719
Are you lost?

1072
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,932
I'm not lost.

1073
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:17,438
Thanks for coming in.

1074
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,110
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
What?

1075
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:24,197
Eddie, I got your labs back,
and your heart has atrophied severely.

1076
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,825
Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.

1077
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,243
I don't want you to fix it.

1078
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,661
I can heal you.

1079
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,457
Can you fix it?

1080
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,459
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1081
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,770
- This parasite, whatever this is...
"Parasite"?

1082
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,398
- It's eating you from the inside.
- Not a parasite. He's not.

1083
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:42,757
- You're using him up.
No. She is wrong.

1084
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:45,218
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1085
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:48,305
- 1, Eddie, am I dying?
No!

1086
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,431
You're killing him.

1087
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,367
They do not know
what they are talking about.

1088
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,743
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1089
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,579
- Oh, God!
We have to get out of here.

1090
01:11:55,687 --> 01:11:56,873
Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1091
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,231
I'm killing you. I'm so sorry.

1092
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,737
No! Don't do that!

1093
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,520
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1094
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,298
What is that?

1095
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,932
You were killing me?

1096
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,353
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1097
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:42,734
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1098
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,195
We're done.

1099
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,842
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1100
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,385
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1101
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,578
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1102
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,142
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1103
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,962
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1104
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,256
but I don't know much more than you do.

1105
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:07,217
I guess he had no one else to turn to.

1106
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,679
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1107
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,615
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1108
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,724
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1109
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:16,142
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1110
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,897
Dan.

1111
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:28,989
Where is it?

1112
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,891
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1113
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,211
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1114
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:30,717
I'm not just gonna Kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1115
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:35,263
No, no, no. I'm gonna
rip your tongue out of your face.

1116
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,515
- Whoo!

1117
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:43,063
Stop. You're bleeding all over my lab.
Go. Go!

1118
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,240
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1119
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:57,827
And you know what? Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1120
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:01,581
I don't trust you, and you're insane.

1121
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,625
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1122
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,228
Long journal entry about that tonight.

1123
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:06,812
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1124
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:10,131
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1125
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:12,592
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1126
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:13,885
It can't go on.

1127
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,554
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1128
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,473
We're parasites. You're a good example.

1129
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,433
Think about it. All you do is take.

1130
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:24,312
You took my Symbiote.
You take potshots at a great man

1131
01:15:24,396 --> 01:15:26,064
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1132
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:30,318
Didn't you take from the person
you loved the most,

1133
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:32,696
who trusted you the most? That's insane.

1134
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,866
What I've initiated
is a whole new world, a new species.

1135
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:39,619
Man and Symbiote combined.

1136
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:42,330
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1137
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:45,417
Because I have spent
a significant amount of time, all right,

1138
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,336
with one of these creatures up my ass.

1139
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,046
It's not a lot of fun.

1140
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:54,050
And then I find out, all along,
that they're killing you.

1141
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,719
This is the last time I'm asking you.

1142
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,929
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1143
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,765
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1144
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,392
Where's Venom?

1145
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:06,187
That is the ugliest-looking thing
I have ever seen.

1146
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,572
You know, Brock, I have no use for you.

1147
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:18,408
Treece! Come and clean up your mess.

1148
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,912
Whoa, he has one up his ass, too.

1149
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:35,925
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1150
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:39,721
There are more of us. Millions more.

1151
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,348
They will follow wherever I lead.

1152
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:45,477
Where we lead.

1153
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,312
Yes,"
, "'we."

1154
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:51,107
But first, we must retrieve them.

1155
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:54,027
I can take care of that.

1156
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,993
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1157
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,077
Shut up.

1158
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,583
Not so tough without your friend.

1159
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:15,089
Did your mama not love you?

1160
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,469
God damn it!

1161
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:24,182
I guess it pays to be a specialist, huh?

1162
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,559
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1163
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:28,241
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1164
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,511
in this world than you and me.

1165
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,523
Much bigger than me.

1166
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:36,986
And it's much, much bigger than you.

1167
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:40,573
Karma's a bitch.

1168
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,534
I don't believe in karma.

1169
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:46,204
- Oh! Ooh!

1170
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:51,835
Hi, Eddie.

1171
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,545
Whoa. Whoa...

1172
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:56,214
Oh...

1173
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:57,757
Mmm...

1174
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,051
Mmm!

1175
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,569
Oh, no.

1176
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,947
I just bit that guy's head off.

1177
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,867
I know, I know.
I've been there, too. It's not fun.

1178
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,661
The one with Drake is Riot.
- Who's Riot?

1179
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,289
Riot is what you would call
a team leader.

1180
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,374
He has an arsenal of weapons.

1181
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,727
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
He is unstoppable.

1182
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,378
- Oh, great.
We have got to go!

1183
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,671
Go where? Where we going?

1184
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:38,563
- Well, I'm coming with you.
No!

1185
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,799
It's going to get ugly.

1186
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:42,635
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1187
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:45,805
Not today.

1188
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,892
Oh, that's bullshit!

1189
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:52,687
This is not a simulation.

1190
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,370
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1191
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,816
I'll be piloting the spacecraft.

1192
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:59,110
- You?
- Yes, me.

1193
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:00,194
How long?

1194
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,238
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1195
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:05,909
But even fully automated,
you can't pilot that craft all alone.

1196
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,329
I'm not alone.

1197
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:16,169
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1198
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,670
It is not safe for her.

1199
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,631
If we do not stop Riot,

1200
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,842
he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.

1201
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:27,472
Millions? What, you were gonna
take the rocket,

1202
01:19:27,722 --> 01:19:29,783
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1203
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,660
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1204
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,311
- on a whole planet?
Yes!

1205
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,563
But it is different now, Eddie.

1206
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:38,024
- I have decided to stay.
- Wow!

1207
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:41,069
On my planet,
I am kind of a loser, like you.

1208
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,738
- But here, we could be more.
- Excuse me?

1209
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,657
And I'm getting to like it here.

1210
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,325
Oh, you like us now, do you, huh?

1211
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,787
However, there will be nothing left
to like if we do not stop that rocket.

1212
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,749
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes to
being completely annihilated,

1213
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,918
- then it's back to "we."
It is "we."

1214
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:59,420
Like it or not,
it is going to take both of us.

1215
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:01,047
Cut the bullshit.

1216
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,715
What really made you change your mind?

1217
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,430
You. You did, Eddie.

1218
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:12,850
Scrub diagnostics.

1219
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,479
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1220
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:25,613
T-minus five minutes to launch.

1221
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:28,616
Auto sequence has been initiated.

1222
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:42,714
Oh, shit.

1223
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,101
T-minus four minutes, 30 seconds.

1224
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:05,903
Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?

1225
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,948
He has got shit you have never seen.

1226
01:21:09,032 --> 01:21:11,034
What does that mean?
What are our chances?

1227
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,995
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1228
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,582
Oh, fuck it.
Well, let's go save the planet.

1229
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,712
T-minus four minutes.

1230
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,093
Initiate orbiter aerosurface profile.

1231
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,724
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1232
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,853
No. We won't let you destroy this world.

1233
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,730
Then die.

1234
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,201
Holy shit!
- Told you.

1235
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:55,053
T-minus three minutes.

1236
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,008
You have a strong host.

1237
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,762
But not strong enough.

1238
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,053
T-minus two minutes, 30 seconds.

1239
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:57,557
Eddie.

1240
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,437
Drake, stop!

1241
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:12,089
Told you I could fight ugly.

1242
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,641
T-minus one minute.

1243
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:40,618
You're too late.

1244
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:42,245
This is the next stage...

1245
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,624
- You talk too much.

1246
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,010
T-minus 30 seconds.

1247
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,887
You are nothing.

1248
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,834
Ten seconds.

1249
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:31,711
Nine...

1250
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:33,587
Eight...

1251
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:35,506
Seven...

1252
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,216
Six...

1253
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:38,926
Five...

1254
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:40,678
Four...

1255
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,221
Three...

1256
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,640
- Two...

1257
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:46,726
- One...

1258
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:49,687
Liftoff.

1259
01:25:57,111 --> 01:25:58,279
Traitor!

1260
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,364
Have a nice life.

1261
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:28,184
Goodbye, Eddie.

1262
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:30,811
Venom, no!

1263
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:21,821
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1264
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,299
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1265
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,033
I feel great. Awesome.

1266
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:27,368
Wow.

1267
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,829
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1268
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,790
Hmm. You're in luck.
I've decided to work pro bono.

1269
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:35,099
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1270
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:37,378
You're a good person, Annie.

1271
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,004
What about you? What are you gonna do?

1272
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,857
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1273
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,800
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1274
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,969
Oh, wow, really? So, what did you say?

1275
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:49,265
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1276
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:51,142
I scored the interview of a lifetime.

1277
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,811
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1278
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,938
Oh! Like everyone else.

1279
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,440
Yeah.

1280
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:02,278
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1281
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,156
Hey, um...

1282
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,452
Do you want to talk about that kiss?

1283
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:12,788
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1284
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:18,085
Uh, that was your buddy's idea.

1285
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,504
Oh, right. Well, that is good to know.

1286
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:25,342
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1287
01:28:26,093 --> 01:28:27,219
I mean, the...

1288
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:30,848
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1289
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:32,534
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1290
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:33,684
Okay.

1291
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,395
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1292
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,772
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1293
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:42,026
Look at her. She has no idea
we are going to get her back.

1294
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,362
No, I don't think so.

1295
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:47,948
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1296
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,759
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1297
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,244
- Nope.
You belong with us, Annie.

1298
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,913
Eddie, are you sure?

1299
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:55,915
Good Lord, look at that.

1300
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:58,167
Look at the time.
I have to go.

1301
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,004
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1302
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,714
You take care, all right?

1303
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,342
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1304
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,932
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1305
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:14,767
Either of you.

1306
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:16,519
We won't.

1307
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:17,937
Who is that guy?
- Okay.

1308
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,147
Wait. This thing looks delicious.

1309
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:23,692
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1310
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:26,654
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1311
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:30,366
You cannot just go around
eating anybody that you want to.

1312
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:32,326
I cannot?
- No, you cannot.

1313
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,262
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1314
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,665
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1315
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:39,792
And then there are bad people.

1316
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,186
You have to tell the difference.

1317
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:45,297
The deal is, you will only ever
be allowed to touch,

1318
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:49,176
harm, hurt, possibly, very possibly,

1319
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,470
eat very, very bad people,

1320
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:54,139
but never, ever, ever good people.
All right?

1321
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:56,475
Fine.
- Good.

1322
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,578
But how does one
tell the difference?

1323
01:29:58,602 --> 01:29:59,603
Well, it's super simple.

1324
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:03,440
I mean, you just have to...
You can intuit it, you can sense it.

1325
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,150
Sometimes you can even feel it.

1326
01:30:05,693 --> 01:30:07,027
Whatever you say.

1327
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:08,862
But can we get something to eat now?

1328
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:14,076
Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.

1329
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,996
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1330
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,833
- Hey, Mrs. C.

1331
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,127
How you doing, Eddie?

1332
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:25,170
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1333
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:26,547
No.

1334
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,343
So, what culinary delights
will tickle the pickle tonight?

1335
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:33,178
Tater tots and chocolate.

1336
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:34,763
Right. Okay, no problem.

1337
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,641
The payment's due, Chen.

1338
01:30:39,268 --> 01:30:41,186
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1339
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,271
Now.

1340
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,440
Bad guy, right?
- Yep.

1341
01:30:51,864 --> 01:30:53,657
You come in here again...

1342
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:58,454
In fact, you go anywhere in this city,
preying on innocent people,

1343
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:02,082
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1344
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,476
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1345
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,879
And then we will eat your face
right off your head. Do you understand?

1346
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:08,255
- Please...
- Yes.

1347
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:12,926
So, you will be this armless, legless,
faceless thing, won't you,

1348
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:17,473
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1349
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,184
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1350
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,521
We are Venom.

1351
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,275
- On second thought...
- Please.

1352
01:31:35,366 --> 01:31:37,534
Eddie? What was that?

1353
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:38,619
Oh...

1354
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:42,873
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1355
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:45,626
"Parasite"?
- Yeah.

1356
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,628
It's a term of endearment, that's all.

1357
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,630
Apologize!
No.

1358
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:52,549
Apologize!
All right, fine.

1359
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:55,469
I'm sorry.
So, what do you want to do now?

1360
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:59,264
The way I see I,
we can do whatever we want.

1361
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,184
Venom

1362
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,103
Adrenaline momentum, venom

1363
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:06,855
Not knowin' when I'm
ever gonna slow up and I'm

1364
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:08,816
Ready to snap any moment I'm

1365
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:10,526
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

1366
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,403
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

1367
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:15,864
Wh-Wh-When they get bit with the venom

1368
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:17,658
I got that adrenaline momentum

1369
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:21,078
Venom, not knowin' when I'm
ever gonna slow up and I'm

1370
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:23,038
Ready to snap any moment I'm

1371
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:24,790
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

1372
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,458
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

1373
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,252
Wh-Wh-When they get bit with the

1374
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,296
I said knock-knock, let the devil in

1375
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,841
Alien, E-E-Elliott, phone home

1376
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,592
Ain't no telling when this chokehold

1377
01:32:35,676 --> 01:32:37,553
On this game will end, I'm loco

1378
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:40,973
Became a Symbiote, so my fangs
are in your throat, oh

1379
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,391
You're snake-bitten with my

1380
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,143
Venom

1381
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,645
With the ballpoint pen,
I'm gun cock, bump stock

1382
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:48,409
Double-aught buckshot,
tied up to a garrote

1383
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,458
Tie a couple knots, fired up
and caught fire, juggernaut

1384
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,192
Punk rock... goin' down like Yung Joc

1385
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:53,902
"Cause the doc put me on like sunblock

1386
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:55,988
Why the... not? You only get one shot

1387
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,865
Ate.. till I can't taste it

1388
01:32:57,948 --> 01:32:59,551
Chased it with straight liquor,
then paint thinner

1389
01:32:59,575 --> 01:33:01,469
Then drank till I faint
and awake with a headache

1390
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,245
And I take anything in rectangular shape

1391
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:06,206
Then I wait to face the demons
I'm bonded to

1392
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,090
'Cause they're chasin' me,
but I'm part of you

1393
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,752
So escapin' me is impossible

1394
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:11,086
I latch onto you like a

1395
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,131
Parasite, and I probably
ruined your parents' life

1396
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,025
And your childhood, too,
'cause if I'm the music

1397
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:17,634
That y'all grew up on, I'm responsible

1398
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:19,478
For you, the nasty fools
I'm the supervillain

1399
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,221
Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to

1400
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:23,015
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you

1401
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:25,476
And I'm the suit, so call me Venom

1402
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,228
I got that adrenaline momentum

1403
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,690
Venom, not knowin' when I'm
ever gonna slow up and I'm

1404
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:33,525
Ready to snap any moment I'm

1405
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,360
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

1406
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:37,112
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

1407
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:38,781
Wh-Wh-When they get bit with the

1408
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:40,616
Venom

1409
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:42,326
I got that adrenaline momentum

1410
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:45,913
Venom, not knowin' when I'm
ever gonna slow up and I'm

1411
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:47,706
Ready to snap any moment I'm

1412
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,333
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

1413
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,251
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

1414
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,961
Wh-Wh-When they get bit with the

1415
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:54,421
Venom

1416
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:56,465
I got that adrenaline momentum

1417
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:00,093
Venom, not knowin' when I'm
ever gonna slow up and I'm

1418
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:01,887
Ready to snap any moment I'm

1419
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,639
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

1420
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:05,349
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

1421
01:34:05,432 --> 01:34:07,100
Wh-Wh-When they get bit with the

1422
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:28,872
I need you to stay quiet.

1423
01:34:28,956 --> 01:34:31,834
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1424
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:35,087
- You got that?
Fine, but make it quick.

1425
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:40,884
Open on five.

1426
01:34:40,968 --> 01:34:43,762
- Go. Opening up.

1427
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:48,223
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1428
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:51,436
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1429
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,105
I'd have shut that shit down.

1430
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,375
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1431
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:57,609
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1432
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:01,029
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1433
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:04,324
FBI don't work
up close and personal with him.

1434
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,287
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1435
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:14,251
Hey, Red! I got a visitor for you.

1436
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:36,607
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1437
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:41,445
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1438
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:42,696
Sure, it's good with me.

1439
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,865
I mean, I can turn it on if you want.

1440
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:51,413
I can talk about the Dadaist patterns
of arterial spray.

1441
01:35:51,914 --> 01:35:53,081
I bet you can.

1442
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:56,710
Tough to see you in this light, Eddie.

1443
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:58,545
Come on over.

1444
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,839
All right.

1445
01:36:05,886 --> 01:36:07,095
I'm here.

1446
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:10,557
When I get out of here, and I will,

1447
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:14,311
There's gonna be carnage.

1448
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:26,959
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1449
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,088
I want to do what you asked.

1450
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:32,173
I really do.

1451
01:48:32,465 --> 01:48:34,509
But... I'm sorry.

1452
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:41,224
I can't do this without you.

1453
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:43,827
- Hey, kid...

1454
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,144
- Whoa.

1455
01:48:45,228 --> 01:48:46,229
What was... Whoa!

1456
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:51,067
What?

1457
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:54,153
Huh?

1458
01:49:02,662 --> 01:49:03,663
No.

1459
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,836
Who are you?

1460
01:49:09,919 --> 01:49:11,319
What are you doing over there?

1461
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:13,631
Freeze! PONY.

1462
01:49:14,132 --> 01:49:15,466
Kid, freeze!

1463
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:20,847
You're kidding me right now?

1464
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:24,434
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

1465
01:49:33,443 --> 01:49:34,610
Ow!

1466
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:35,945
Somebody stop that train!

1467
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:49,500
Aah!

1468
01:49:58,509 --> 01:49:59,510
Sorry.

1469
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:11,457
Looks like a
child dressed like Spider-Man,

1470
01:50:11,481 --> 01:50:12,815
dragging a homeless corpse

1471
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:13,959
- behind a train.

1472
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:15,169
Who are you?
Who are you?

1473
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:18,112
Why are you trying to kill me?
I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

1474
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:40,259
Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

1475
01:50:41,302 --> 01:50:43,721
All right. Thanks, New York.
