1
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,860
- Happy birthday
- Thank you.

2
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,458
Happy birthday.

3
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:01,483
Oh, thank you.

4
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,068
Happy birthday.

5
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:04,093
Thank you.

6
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,326
I don't care if we need to see

7
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,653
every fucking young girl
in this fucking town

8
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,266
in the next few weeks.

9
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,251
Look, I'll make it simple.

10
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:35,279
We need her young.

11
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,374
We need her hot.

12
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,130
We need her now.

13
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,416
How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long...

14
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,671
That's the fucking mystery to me.

15
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,330
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

16
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,333
When was that back in the 30s?

17
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,618
What, for King Kong?

18
00:06:56,798 --> 00:07:01,166
No, I don't give a
fuck what we promised her.

19
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,454
This is network TV,

20
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,927
not a fucking charity.

21
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,187
Find me somebody new.

22
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now.

23
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:13,524
Hey, did you know that a woman's

24
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,594
fertility starts to
decrease about the age of 25?

25
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,388
How old is Jennifer?

26
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,625
You better get busy.

27
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,569
It's like when you see
someone fart on screen.

28
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,802
People just love that.

29
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,228
I mean, that's just the way it is.

30
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,291
So you know what I mean?

31
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,022
People are just people.

32
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,792
And I have to give people what they want.

33
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,861
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

34
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,350
And people always ask for something new.

35
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:27,512
Renewal is inevitable.

36
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:31,207
And at 50, well...

37
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,145
it stops.

38
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,323
What stops?

39
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,209
What?

40
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,791
What stops?

41
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:44,609
Um, you know, the um...

42
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:48,750
The um...

43
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:50,722
The um...

44
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,030
Oh, George!

45
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:56,017
Oh, oh!

46
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,149
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

47
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,292
Harvey!

48
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,668
George, those ratings are insane!

49
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,295
You're a genius!

50
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,347
Oh, what a mess. You're a genius.

51
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,175
That's why you've been drinking.

52
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Oh, that's hilarious.

53
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:01,645
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

54
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,725
because we have
X-rayed you from head to toe,

55
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,786
and you don't have so
much as a cracked molar.

56
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,260
So, you are good to go.

57
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,650
Uh, vaccination, okay.

58
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,742
Not going on a vacation.

59
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,323
By the way, I just want to say:

60
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,903
my wife is a huge fan.

61
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:21,926
Um...

62
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,019
blood type...

63
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,959
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

64
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:27,283
Happy bir—

65
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,391
Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.

66
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,594
I, uh, have to....

67
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,335
Have a... um....

68
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:43,927
Bye.

69
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,375
One moment.

70
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,509
There's just one last exam to perform.

71
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,792
I thought he said I was good to go.

72
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,572
Is there a problem?

73
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,600
No, it's perfect.

74
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:23,392
You're a good candidate.

75
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,037
I mean, you're good to go.

76
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,639
I wish you the best.

77
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Lizzie?

78
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Lizzie Sparkle?

79
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,647
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

80
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,044
Fred!

81
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,250
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

82
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,847
Oh, Fred, of course.

83
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,262
You haven't changed a bit.

84
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:33,659
You're still the most beautiful
girl in the whole wide world.

85
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,684
You know, I followed your career.

86
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,527
What a success.

87
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,287
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

88
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,079
Wow.

89
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,030
Hey...

90
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:44,828
Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink sometime

91
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,925
now that we're,
you know, reconnected?

92
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:48,012
Um...

93
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,416
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

94
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,315
You're super busy.

95
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,767
You know what?

96
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,382
Why don't you give me your card?

97
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,822
I mean, you never know.

98
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,438
Um, sure, what I...

99
00:12:58,438 --> 00:12:59,745
This'll do. Oh...

100
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,725
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

101
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,750
They're a disaster.

102
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:06,996
Oh, God.

103
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:07,941
What was that?

104
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:11,655
There.

105
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,021
Now you've got it.

106
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,187
<i>Have you ever dreamt of a
better version of yourself?</i>

107
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,791
<i>Younger.</i>

108
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:17,538
<i>More beautiful.</i>

109
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,416
<i>More perfect.</i>

110
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,116
<i>One single injection unlocks your DNA,</i>

111
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:29,708
<i>starting a new cellular division that
will release another version of yourself.</i>

112
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:31,982
This is...

113
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

114
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,500
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

115
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,416
<i>And everything is you.</i>

116
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>This is simply a
better version of yourself.</i>

117
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:46,958
<i>You just have to share.</i>

118
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,134
<i>One week for one</i>

119
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,125
<i>and one week for the other.</i>

120
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,333
<i>A perfect balance of seven days each.</i>

121
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,952
<i>The one and only thing not to forget:</i>

122
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,939
<i>You can't escape from yourself.</i>

123
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
<i>Yes.</i>

124
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,057
Hello.

125
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,973
I'd like to order.

126
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,313
<i>Address.</i>

127
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,393
1057 Beverly Canyon.

128
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:43,503
<i>Write this down.</i>

129
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,585
<i>35 North Byron Alley.</i>

130
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,806
35 North...

131
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,824
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

132
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:48,224
<i>Everything comes from you,</i>

133
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:51,124
<i>and everything is you.</i>

134
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,539
<i>This is simply...</i>

135
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,979
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

136
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:14,705
Hello.

137
00:36:57,764 --> 00:36:58,630
Thanks.

138
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,118
We'll let you know by next week.

139
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,375
Thank you so much.

140
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,184
I'm just dying to get the part.

141
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,090
Great dancer.

142
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:15,323
Too bad her boobs aren't in the
middle of her face instead of that nose.

143
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,003
Next!

144
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,125
Looks like everything sure is
in the right place this time.

145
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,630
Please say your name, age, measurements.

146
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,256
I'm Sue.

147
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:02,021
I'm Sue.

148
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:07,615
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue,

149
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,433
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

150
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,958
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

151
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,494
Where is she?

152
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,475
Where is she?

153
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:36,053
What a gorgeous little angel.

154
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:47,301
You're hired.

155
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:52,524
We want a show that's just like you.

156
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:53,934
Beautiful and happy.

157
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:55,946
People want to be happy.

158
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,620
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

159
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:02,741
I'm gonna let you organize
the rest with my assistant, uh...

160
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,486
- Uh...
- Isabella?

161
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,766
Is-is-is...

162
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:11,941
Who has time to say that?

163
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,038
We're gonna make you Cindy.

164
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,348
It's shorter, it's better.

165
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,250
So, I'm gonna let you
organize everything else with Cindy.

166
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,500
Oh, um, before you go,

167
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,403
I just have to mention a...

168
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:27,626
small scheduling issue.

169
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:29,855
I have to be...

170
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,481
out of town every other week...

171
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,644
to take care of my mother...

172
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,355
who's very sick.

173
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,174
I want you for this show.

174
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,555
And we will work around
any mother, brother,

175
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,994
fucking sick puppy
you need to take care of.

176
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,170
Hmm?

177
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:58,319
Hmm.

178
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:03,983
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

179
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,722
People are gonna love that.

180
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,770
Perfect.

181
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,791
So you jump out,
touch your elbows,

182
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:10,710
head down, contract.

183
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,166
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

184
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:47,032
Oh, there she is!

185
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:54,170
Where have you been?

186
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:58,145
We've all been wanting to have a
drink with you for your departure.

187
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,515
Anyway...

188
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:02,881
We all chipped in...

189
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,667
and we got you just a little
something to keep you busy.

190
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,981
It's French.

191
00:45:10,006 --> 00:45:11,849
My wife, she's very inspired.

192
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:12,960
Oh, I love my wife.

193
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,041
Oops, I gotta run.

194
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,000
But it's always great to see you.

195
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,583

199
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:53,041
<i>Look at the quality of this thing!</i>

200
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:54,648
<i>This thing is sturdy.</i>

201
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,411
<i>Beautiful!</i>

202
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:57,937
<i>You can listen to
your music at home, shoppers.</i>

203
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:00,271
<i>For $49.98, I'll take one myself.</i>

204
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:01,613

208
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:38,363
<i>I haven't slept in three nights!</i>

209
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:39,963
<i>Open up.</i>

210
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:42,499
<i>God dammit!
When you gonna open the—</i>

211
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,290
I, uh... Sorry.

212
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:49,765
I thought that Ms. Sparkle...

213
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:50,765
She moved out.

214
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,209
I'm the new tenant.

215
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:54,567
Sue.

216
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:56,820
Oliver.

217
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:58,443
Oliver.

218
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:00,319
Oliver.

219
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,290
You wanted to complain about something?

220
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:04,608
Oliver?

221
00:50:05,493 --> 00:50:06,493
What?

222
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:07,854
No.

223
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:09,938
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

224
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:13,669
I think it's, like, awesome when
there's stuff going on in the building...

225
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:14,829
you know what I mean?

226
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:17,495
Um...

227
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:19,333
I'm actually...

228
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:22,527
quite handy if you ever need...

229
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:26,425
need me to be of aid in any way.

230
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:28,955
I got a sack of tools, and a...

231
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:31,655
and a big hammer.

232
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:35,439
You know what I mean.

233
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:40,258
Anyways, I live right here,

234
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:41,732
so you know where to find me.

235
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,170
Anytime.

236
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Day or night.

237
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:46,759
Later.

238
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Hi everybody.

239
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,218
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

240
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,290
Are you ready?

241
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:49,210
Let's go.

242
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,602
Thank you so much everybody.

243
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,380
I'll see you next week.

244
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:27,986
And in the meantime,

245
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:30,590
take care of yourself.

246
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:37,790
Where is she?

247
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:41,274
There she is!

248
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,741
Wonderful, wonderful.

249
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:47,362
That's what I'm talking about!

250
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:51,455
Yes!

251
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:06,371
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

252
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:13,666
Don't eat too fast.

253
00:58:26,935 --> 00:58:28,014
Are you all right?

254
00:58:32,347 --> 00:58:33,400
Yes, I'll be right back.

255
00:59:10,564 --> 00:59:11,420
Are you all right?

256
00:59:57,401 --> 00:59:58,583
What did you do?

257
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,220
You seem even more
beautiful than before.

258
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,330
<i>Yes.</i>

259
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:38,006
Yes, hi.

260
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,498
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

261
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:47,991
I'm 503.

262
01:02:49,023 --> 01:02:50,023
<i>Yes.</i>

263
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:52,117
Yes, hi.

264
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,933
There's been a slight...

265
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,120
misuse of the substance.

266
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:03,609
A few extra hours
were accidentally used...

267
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,343
causing, um...

268
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:08,256
an alteration.

269
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:11,666
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

270
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,791
<i>What has been used on one
side is lost on the other side.</i>

271
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,333
<i>There is no going back.</i>

272
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:27,393
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

273
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:30,015
And obviously she was drunk.

274
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,816
<i>Remember there is no she and you.</i>

275
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:34,033
<i>You are one.</i>

276
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:38,110
<i>Respect the balance and you
won't have any more inconveniences.</i>

277
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,330
Sue!

278
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,330
Sue?

279
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,728
I just saw you on TV.

280
01:05:22,338 --> 01:05:23,955
Holy moly.

281
01:05:25,499 --> 01:05:26,895
Makes me want to join your class.

282
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:29,500
Hey, you don't give
private lessons, do you?

283
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:33,204
Hey, um...

284
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,166
What about a
drink at my place tonight?

285
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:40,526
Come on, don't be shy.

286
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:44,080
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

287
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:50,855
All right, take your
time, but it's a date.

288
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:53,722
<i>♪ You know, pump it up ♪</i>

289

<i>♪ You got to pump it up ♪</i>

290
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,666

<i>♪ You got to pump it up ♪</i>

292
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,076
What can I get you?

293
01:07:29,222 --> 01:07:30,563
Mocha Latte.

294
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,471
It's long, isn't it?

295
01:07:43,448 --> 01:07:44,448
Excuse me?

296
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:50,271
Seven days.

297
01:08:20,277 --> 01:08:21,875
Did you follow me here?

298
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,844
I was just curious...

299
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:27,670
to find out how
things were going for you.

300
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:31,372
Each time you feel a little more...

301
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:33,273
lonely.

302
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:35,264
Don't you think?

303
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

304
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:41,531
I'm fine.

305
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:44,175
Everything's fine.

306
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:46,846
It gets harder each time...

307
01:08:47,646 --> 01:08:49,232
to remember that you...

308
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:52,472
still deserve to exist.

309
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:57,086
That this part of yourself...

310
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,893
is still worth something,

311
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,497
that you...

312
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:04,580
still matter.

313
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:10,836
Has she started yet?

314
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,048
Eating away at you?

315
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:33,380
Fuck!

316
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,610
Watch out!

317
01:09:43,336 --> 01:09:44,336
What?

318
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:55,877
Hey!

319
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:57,290
Move!

320
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:31,166
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

321
01:10:41,093 --> 01:10:42,093
<i>Hello?</i>

322
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,925
Hi, Fred.

323
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,241
It's Lizzie.

324
01:10:48,464 --> 01:10:49,464
Hello?

325
01:10:50,272 --> 01:10:51,666
<i>Sorry, I mean, I'm in shock.</i>

326
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:53,983
- Oh.
- <i>Wow.</i>

327
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:55,258
<i>Wow, wow.</i>

328
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,074
<i>I thought I'd never
hear from you again after...</i>

329
01:10:58,099 --> 01:11:00,015
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

330
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,404
I just, I've just...

331
01:11:01,748 --> 01:11:03,330
been really busy lately.

332
01:11:04,076 --> 01:11:05,330
So listen...

333
01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:07,668
I was thinking that...

334
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:12,500
maybe we could get
together and grab a drink.

335
01:11:18,286 --> 01:11:19,286
Are you still there?

336
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:22,390
<i>Sorry, I-I'm in shock again.</i>

337
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,046
<i>I could book Luigi's, at eight?</i>

338
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:30,986
Eight at Luigi's it is.

339
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:34,665
I will see you tonight.

340
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,746
<i>Bye.</i>

341
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:38,360
Okay, bye.

342
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,814
<i>And we're back!
Welcome back to Who Knows!</i>

343
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,933
<i>Father Judy, are you ready?</i>

344
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:38,582
<i>Well now you've seen the scales.</i>

345
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:41,095
<i>Who Knows is the show
where you keep your eye on—</i>

346
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,854
Hi everybody.

347
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,067
Hi!

348
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,744
Okay, here we go everyone.

349
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:47,769
Clear the set please.

350
01:16:47,892 --> 01:16:49,504
First positions, thank you.

351
01:16:49,555 --> 01:16:50,555
Roll cameras.

352
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:54,666
And in three, two, one.

353
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,380
And squat, squat, squat.

354
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,750
Circle those hips.

355
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,750
Circle those hips.

356
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,065
Contract, contract, contract,

357
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,460
contract, contract, contract.

358
01:17:11,162 --> 01:17:12,870
Head between your legs.

359
01:17:18,995 --> 01:17:19,995
Cut.

360
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:25,941
I'm sorry, I thought I, uh...

361
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:28,366
thought I— I—

362
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:30,459
I just got distracted.

363
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,233
Not a problem, let's
get right back to it.

364
01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:34,826
Back to one please.

365
01:17:37,981 --> 01:17:39,469
Sorry, it's the control room now.

366
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,208
The director said he saw something
bizarre on the monitor.

367
01:17:42,299 --> 01:17:43,659
Bring up the replay on camera two.

368
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,920
Camera two.

369
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,061
Forward.

370
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:04,395
Can I have my dressing gown?

371
01:18:04,593 --> 01:18:05,580
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

372
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:06,580
Well then go and get it.

373
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,122
Let's just take this frame by frame.

374
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:24,830
I need five minutes.

375
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,710
- <i>Yes.</i>
- This balance is not working.

376
01:20:26,277 --> 01:20:28,360
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

377
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:31,371
while she wastes seven days

378
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:33,164
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

379
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:35,225
<i>Remember there is no she and you.</i>

380
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,031
<i>You are—</i>

381
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:40,784
Hello, everybody.

382
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,042
What's happening?
Where is everybody?

383
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:48,522
The taping's been canceled.

384
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:50,765
What, why?

385
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,662
Sue.

386
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:54,176
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

387
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:56,363
Okay.

388
01:20:56,817 --> 01:20:57,790
I'll go change and—

389
01:20:57,815 --> 01:20:59,237
No, he said now.

390
01:21:17,009 --> 01:21:18,302
I'll get right to the point.

391
01:21:19,593 --> 01:21:21,602
We can't keep you on the morning show.

392
01:21:22,971 --> 01:21:24,016
But why?

393
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,198
I just started.

394
01:21:26,001 --> 01:21:28,086
Ratings are through the roof.

395
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,839
We started at 42.

396
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:33,040
Now we're up to like...

397
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:35,039
216.

398
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:37,580
It's phenomenal.

399
01:21:38,808 --> 01:21:40,210
People love you.

400
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,355
They adore you.

401
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:45,325
They want more and more and more of you.

402
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:47,433
That is why we have decided...

403
01:21:47,887 --> 01:21:50,392
that we want you to host...

404
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,201
the New Year's Eve show.

405
01:21:54,131 --> 01:21:55,336
You mean the...

406
01:21:55,361 --> 01:21:56,979
The network's biggest show.

407
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:59,525
50 million viewers live.

408
01:21:59,589 --> 01:22:01,589
You can't go higher than that.

409
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,540
That's gonna be intense.

410
01:22:05,698 --> 01:22:08,320
We only have a few
months to pull it off, so...

411
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:10,428
are you in?

412
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:23,584
If you don't open the
door when opportunity knocks,

413
01:22:23,608 --> 01:22:24,835
you won't get another chance.

414
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:28,275
You of all people know this.

415
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:43,131
Just one more day and
then I have a whole week off.

416
01:22:43,156 --> 01:22:44,080
We can switch.

417
01:23:02,349 --> 01:23:03,861
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

418
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:06,564
Just one more day, okay?

419
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:15,830
<i>Yes.</i>

420
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:17,935
She didn't respect the balance.

421
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:21,170
She's stealing more
and more time from me,

422
01:24:21,394 --> 01:24:25,145
completely without
consideration of the consequences.

423
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,670
She's a selfish bitch.

424
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

425
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:31,750
Stop?

426
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:33,314
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

427
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:35,351
<i>If you are not satisfied,</i>

428
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:37,272
<i>you can put an end to the experience</i>

429
01:24:37,297 --> 01:24:39,958
<i>and go back to being
just you on your own.</i>

430
01:24:40,395 --> 01:24:41,395
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

431
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:46,944
Will it go back to the way it was before?

432
01:24:47,143 --> 01:24:49,349
<i>What has been
transferred won't come back,</i>

433
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:51,817
<i>but you can stop the
experience as of now.</i>

434
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:53,134
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

435
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:56,165
<i>To go back to being just you on your own?</i>

436
01:24:58,902 --> 01:24:59,902
No.

437
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:03,453
No, no, no.

438
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,179
I can't stop.

439
01:25:07,029 --> 01:25:07,750
She just...

440
01:25:09,935 --> 01:25:10,708
I...

441
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:18,497
The balance just needs to be respected.

442
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:19,666
<i>So respect it.</i>

443
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,400
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it.

444
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:37,390
<i>You are the winner!</i>

445
01:25:37,885 --> 01:25:40,875
<i>Well, Bob, congratulations,
you've won $25,000.</i>

446
01:25:41,186 --> 01:25:44,433
<i>Now you have one final chance to
answer a simple question</i>

447
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:48,958
<i>in our big question
round and play for $250,000.</i>

448
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:55,855
<i>And you'll have just 45
seconds to come to a conclusion.</i>

449
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,890
<i>Answer correctly
as best you can...</i>

450
01:26:53,488 --> 01:26:55,819
Just a little something to keep you busy.

451
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:09,386
Fuck.

452
01:27:36,513 --> 01:27:38,909
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

453
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:42,897
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

454
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:43,843
Are you ready?

455
01:27:43,868 --> 01:27:45,957
Let's welcome her, Sue.

456
01:27:47,993 --> 01:27:53,210
You popped up out of nowhere on
our screens like a tornado.

457
01:27:53,235 --> 01:27:56,750
I don't think anybody was
really prepared for this whirlwind .

458
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,245
It all started with the morning show

459
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:12,275
and rumor has it that you are
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

460
01:28:14,597 --> 01:28:16,014
Wait, just a moment.

461
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:20,565
I'm being told that you are going to host
the New Year's Eve show.

462
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:21,590
Can you confirm this?

463
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:23,239
Yes, that's right.

464
01:28:23,376 --> 01:28:24,376
<i>"Yes, that's right."</i>

465
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,322
Oh my God, that is huge news.

466
01:28:33,584 --> 01:28:34,935
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

467
01:28:35,052 --> 01:28:36,019
Where are you from?

468
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,580
How did you get discovered?

469
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:40,887
I want— We want to know everything.

470
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,391
Well, I mean, there's...

471
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,120
really not very much to tell.

472
01:28:48,743 --> 01:28:51,137
I'm just a girl from a...

473
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:53,666
very small town in Indiana.

474
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,476
I'm sure that
you've never heard of it.

475
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:57,890
In fact, it's not even a town.

476
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:00,326
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village.

477
01:29:01,752 --> 01:29:03,152
It's a farm, perhaps?

478
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:12,095
But ever since I can remember,

479
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,321
it has always been my
dream to be on screen.

480
01:29:15,891 --> 01:29:17,990
This is my dream.

481
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,145
As a child, I used to
put on shows for my family.

482
01:29:20,596 --> 01:29:22,077
Mm, your family.

483
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:23,710
How sweet.

484
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,185
So, everyone is aware...

485
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:33,445
that you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

486
01:29:34,628 --> 01:29:37,753
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

487
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:39,492
you turned up the volume,

488
01:29:39,517 --> 01:29:41,546
and you rocked their world.

489
01:29:41,932 --> 01:29:43,213
Were you a fan of her show?

490
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:48,841
Um...

491
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,855
Well...

492
01:29:52,266 --> 01:29:53,827
Well, I can't, uh...

493
01:29:54,551 --> 01:29:58,227
I can't really say that I
actually watched her show.

494
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:02,527
You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

495
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:06,620
And you have to admit, it
was a bit old-fashioned.

496
01:30:09,624 --> 01:30:11,028
Jurassic Fitness, really.

497
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:13,435
<i>"Jurassic Fitness"?</i>

498
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,420
It needed a change.

499
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,250
I'll fucking show you.

500
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,628
You wanna see
some Jurassic Fitness?

501
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:25,920
You want it?

502
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:30,147
Come on, come get your
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

503
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,580
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

504
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:45,120
So, every morning...

505
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:47,080
rain or shine...

506
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:49,830
Sparkle Your Life was on TV.

507
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,213
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

508
01:30:52,936 --> 01:30:54,186
Whether I liked it or not.

509
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:58,335
I guess that's why you could say
we have some sort of connection.

510
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,052
"Some sort of connection"?

511
01:31:00,268 --> 01:31:02,893
You wouldn't exist without me.

512
01:31:12,984 --> 01:31:14,338
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

513
01:31:14,363 --> 01:31:18,832
It is time, ladies and
gentlemen, for our final question.

514
01:31:18,862 --> 01:31:24,201
The question that we ask each
and every one of our guests.

515
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:25,226
Okay.

516
01:31:25,386 --> 01:31:30,170
Would you share one of your
little beauty secrets with us?

517
01:31:31,928 --> 01:31:36,181
Just one little trick of yours that
helps you look so incredibly stunning.

518
01:31:36,206 --> 01:31:37,128
I mean, look at you.

519
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:39,484
- I don't know, uh...
- Say it!

520
01:31:39,997 --> 01:31:40,997
Say it!

521
01:31:42,327 --> 01:31:43,838
- Let me think.
- Say it!

522
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,938
Tell them who your
little beauty secret is!

523
01:31:46,963 --> 01:31:49,511
- I guess...
- Why don't we just show them right here.

524
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,377
Here's your little beauty secret.

525
01:31:51,483 --> 01:31:53,210
I guess I just try to be myself.

526
01:31:53,515 --> 01:31:56,330
To be sincere and
grateful for all that I have.

527
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:59,330
And to always remember
to lead with my heart.

528
01:31:59,517 --> 01:32:01,475
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

529
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,030
We'll be back in a minute.

530
01:32:11,933 --> 01:32:16,000
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

531
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,920
Stop it!

532
01:32:19,918 --> 01:32:20,918
Stop it.

533
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,095
You're taking it from me.

534
01:32:23,506 --> 01:32:25,135
That's your little secret.

535
01:32:25,828 --> 01:32:27,094
Stop it!

536
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:28,250
Stop it!

537
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:29,725
Stop it! Stop it!

538
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,330
Stop it!

539
01:32:30,355 --> 01:32:41,827
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

540
01:32:41,852 --> 01:32:46,457
You have to control yourself!

541
01:33:06,153 --> 01:33:07,715
I can't go back to her.

542
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,405
Gross! Old! Fat!

543
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:20,670
Destructive!

544
01:34:41,314 --> 01:34:42,314
Coming to bed?

545
01:34:43,776 --> 01:34:46,223
Yes, I'll be right there.

546
01:35:51,302 --> 01:35:52,067
<i>Yes.</i>

547
01:35:52,092 --> 01:35:53,790
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

548
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:55,982
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

549
01:35:58,685 --> 01:35:59,685
Hello?

550
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:02,791
It's fucking 503.

551
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,502
<i>Yes.</i>

552
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:06,277
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

553
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,723
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

554
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,298
<i>It means you've reached the end.</i>

555
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:12,968
What do you mean the end?

556
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,667
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

557
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:18,041
<i>If you want more, you must
let the fluid regenerate.</i>

558
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:19,790
Tell me how to do it.

559
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:22,519
I need to stabilize myself right now.

560
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,386
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

561
01:36:27,298 --> 01:36:28,298
Excuse me?

562
01:36:28,546 --> 01:36:31,416
<i>The switch reboots the
fluid secretion process</i>

563
01:36:31,441 --> 01:36:33,796
<i>so you can continue to
enjoy the experience.</i>

564
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:35,799
No, no, no, no, no.

565
01:36:36,201 --> 01:36:37,670
I can't switch, I can't.

566
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:39,480
Especially not now.

567
01:36:39,718 --> 01:36:41,093
<i>There is no other option.</i>

568
01:37:07,993 --> 01:37:08,993
Sue?

569
01:37:21,398 --> 01:37:22,398
Babe?

570
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:26,573
Sue?

571
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:28,277
You all right?

572
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,666
Stressed out about tomorrow?

573
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:42,290
Babe?

574
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,120
Babe?

575
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,250
Sue? Is something wrong?

576
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,190
You a little cranky
because of your lady business?

577
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:11,118
Sue, open the door.

578
01:38:12,575 --> 01:38:13,561
Come on, Sue.

579
01:38:14,048 --> 01:38:15,836
It's not funny, I need to take a piss.

580
01:38:17,753 --> 01:38:19,041
Sue, open the door.

581
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,445
Open the door, Sue, come on.

582
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:41,111
Sue!

583
01:38:42,763 --> 01:38:44,290
Open the door! Come on!

584
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:47,367
Sue, open the door.

585
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,854
Sue, open the door!

586
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,559
What the fuck?

587
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:57,460
Get the fuck out!

588
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:59,855
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

589
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,330
Leave me alone!

590
01:39:10,136 --> 01:39:12,021
What the fuck?

591
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:06,132
<i>Yes.</i>

592
01:40:09,407 --> 01:40:11,115
It's 503.

593
01:40:12,194 --> 01:40:13,632
I want to stop.

594
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:17,367
<i>Are you sure? Once you
stop, you can't go back.</i>

595
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,920
I want to stop!

596
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:21,193
I want to fucking stop!

597
01:40:21,748 --> 01:40:23,210
I want to stop!

598
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:25,201
<i>We'll deliver.</i>

599
01:41:12,469 --> 01:41:13,330
Sue, I was—

600
01:41:13,355 --> 01:41:14,057
Fuck off!

601
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:36,119
<i>Are you sure?</i>

602
01:42:38,612 --> 01:42:40,645
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

603
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:43,647
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

604
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,913
<i>Just on your own.</i>

605
01:42:48,552 --> 01:42:52,431
<i>Just on your own.</i>

606
01:42:52,456 --> 01:42:53,945
Shut the fuck up!

607
01:43:56,152 --> 01:43:57,152
Oh shit...

608
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,703
I can't...

609
01:44:00,436 --> 01:44:02,156
I can't do this.

610
01:44:05,209 --> 01:44:06,666
I need you.

611
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:08,421
Because...

612
01:44:08,654 --> 01:44:10,440
I need myself.

613
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,673
We...

614
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:17,086
You gotta get ready.

615
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:19,397
It's our big night.

616
01:44:20,274 --> 01:44:22,715
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.

617
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,710
Come on.

618
01:44:26,024 --> 01:44:26,710
Come on.

619
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:30,207
You're the only lovable part of me.

620
01:44:30,232 --> 01:44:31,814
You have to come back.

621
01:44:32,245 --> 01:44:33,305
You have to come back!

622
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:34,120
Come back!

623
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,040
Okay. Okay.

624
01:44:55,387 --> 01:44:56,250
Come on.

625
01:44:58,512 --> 01:44:59,380
Come on.

626
01:45:08,858 --> 01:45:09,580
Come on.

627
01:47:55,661 --> 01:47:56,500
Oh, don't!

628
01:51:12,403 --> 01:51:14,164
Got an hour and a half for makeup and hair.

629
01:51:14,189 --> 01:51:16,341
Then we gotta get you in the fitting room,
get you your dress.

630
01:51:16,365 --> 01:51:18,947
After that, we'll have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

631
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:20,633
Then we have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

632
01:51:20,658 --> 01:51:21,445
You got it?

633
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:22,964
You good?
Okay, let's go.

634
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
The dress!

635
01:51:32,403 --> 01:51:33,403
Wonderful!

636
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:35,340
Perfect!

637
01:51:43,462 --> 01:51:45,155
There you go...

638
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,380
It's good.

639
01:51:54,042 --> 01:51:55,258
Can we get the dance lights?

640
01:52:00,501 --> 01:52:01,942
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

641
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,337
<i>They need to see you on
stage to set the lights.</i>

642
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:56,619
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

643
01:53:57,937 --> 01:53:59,693
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

644
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:04,214
<i>More beautiful, more perfect.</i>

645
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,429
<i>Sue?</i>

646
01:54:07,699 --> 01:54:09,190
Yes, let me meet you there.

647
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:11,230
<i>Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.</i>

648
01:54:27,863 --> 01:54:28,863
Sue?

649
01:54:32,412 --> 01:54:34,856
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

650
01:54:34,881 --> 01:54:37,583
They have been dying to meet you.

651
01:54:41,435 --> 01:54:45,216
Is everything okay?

652
01:54:50,187 --> 01:54:51,247
So smile.

653
01:54:59,275 --> 01:55:01,170
That's what we want tonight.

654
01:55:02,627 --> 01:55:06,147
Pretty girls should always smile.

655
01:55:20,322 --> 01:55:22,750
Feathers, feathers, feathers!

656
01:56:14,416 --> 01:56:15,799
Hey, you ready for tonight?

657
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:07,120
I just need a better version of myself.

658
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,420
Please give me a better
version of myself, please.

659
01:57:16,196 --> 01:57:17,657
Please!

660
01:57:19,192 --> 01:57:20,997
Come on!

661
01:59:15,297 --> 01:59:19,037
Looks like everything sure is in the
right place this time.

662
01:59:20,962 --> 01:59:23,835
Please say your name, age, measurements.

663
02:02:21,002 --> 02:02:24,534
Pretty girls should always smile.

664
02:02:59,477 --> 02:03:01,117
At last, we're starting to worry.

665
02:03:01,142 --> 02:03:02,262
Hurry up, you're up in five.

666
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,633
There she is, so beautiful.

667
02:03:25,083 --> 02:03:26,083
We love you.

668
02:03:27,747 --> 02:03:29,080
This is where you belong.

669
02:03:29,388 --> 02:03:30,638
And you'll always belong here.

670
02:03:31,068 --> 02:03:32,360
We can't do it without you.

671
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:34,080
We could never do without you.

672
02:03:34,810 --> 02:03:36,439
You're irreplaceable!

673
02:04:04,807 --> 02:04:05,922
Girls, come on, let's go.

674
02:04:05,947 --> 02:04:06,929
What are we waiting for?

675
02:04:06,954 --> 02:04:09,689
Alright, come on, everybody,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

676
02:04:13,227 --> 02:04:15,652
You will not be disappointed.

677
02:04:16,366 --> 02:04:18,544
She's my most beautiful creation.

678
02:04:18,569 --> 02:04:20,631
I have shaped her for success.

679
02:04:26,177 --> 02:04:27,167
Five...

680
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:28,653
Four...

681
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:30,081
Three...

682
02:04:30,657 --> 02:04:31,774
Two...

683
02:04:31,799 --> 02:04:32,831
One.

684
02:06:13,625 --> 02:06:18,798
I'm so happy to be with you tonight.

685
02:06:21,494 --> 02:06:27,307
I've missed you all so much!

686
02:07:27,783 --> 02:07:29,643
The monster!

687
02:07:37,375 --> 02:07:39,040
Shoot the monster!

688
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:41,460
It's a freak!

689
02:07:41,975 --> 02:07:42,790
No...

690
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:44,908
Shoot the monster!

691
02:07:47,044 --> 02:07:47,951
Monster!

692
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:55,120
Freak!

693
02:07:59,614 --> 02:08:00,620
Freak!

694
02:08:03,121 --> 02:08:05,254
You freak!

695
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:10,115
Monster!

696
02:08:13,258 --> 02:08:15,438
- Freak!
- Monster!

697
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,120
Monster!

698
02:08:21,143 --> 02:08:22,456
It's me.

699
02:08:24,518 --> 02:08:26,095
It's me.

700
02:09:31,477 --> 02:09:35,072
<i>Too bad her boobs aren't in the
middle of her face instead of that nose.</i>

701
02:09:36,815 --> 02:09:37,815
<i>Hmm.</i>

702
02:09:38,616 --> 02:09:39,616
<i>Next!</i>

703
02:09:45,668 --> 02:09:49,002
<i>Pretty girls should always smile.</i>

704
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:56,830
<i>And at 50, it stops.</i>

705
02:12:57,946 --> 02:12:58,946
So beautiful!

706
02:13:00,181 --> 02:13:01,554
We love you!

707
02:13:04,295 --> 02:13:05,994
You're irreplaceable!
