1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,950
GORDON: His name is Will Thomas.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,640
Parents died in a home invasion

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,480
a few weeks after the bridges came down.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,770
Guys that broke in
took him to some sort of factory

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,870
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,550
all chained together.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,860
BULLOCK: God.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,610
Who are these guys?

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,840
Call themselves The Soothsayers.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,390
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,230
But who can keep track these days?

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,030
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water, he said.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,110
Had them digging some sort of tunnel.

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,350
Will broke free
from his restraints last night

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,290
and walked nine miles through
the Dark Zone to find us.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,800
What kind of tunnel?

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,830
Unclear.

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,240
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,830
Detective Gordon?

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,420
My friends.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,130
You'll save them, won't you?

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,680
I'll look into it.

23
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,560
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,790
They'll punish the others for it.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,550
Please, Mr. Gordon.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,140
I promised them I'd bring help.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,970
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
but need I remind you that
every two-bit criminal out there

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,936
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,176
So you're saying we do nothing?

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,226
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,376
someone's gonna take a shot at you,

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,546
and if it's not you that's getting hit,

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,156
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

35
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,730
which is most likely gonna be me.

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,370
Captain.

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,970
There's a call from the mainland.

38
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,900
MAN: <i>All of us here believe</i>

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,120
<i>that if peace is to be sustained
on the island,</i>

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,010
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

41
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,460
We have kids in danger out there.

42
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,430
We're their only hope for rescue.

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,140
<i>Your dedication to your job
is admirable, Captain,</i>

44
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,600
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,050
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,380
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing</i>

47
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,130
<i>thousands of others
should you be killed.</i>

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,880
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

49
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,870
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

50
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,860
I don't need opinions, I need supplies.

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,490
When can I expect them?

52
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,080
<i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,470
<i>we cannot sacrifice any more pilots,</i>

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,030
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

55
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,810
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

56
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,830
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
BULLOCK: Jim.

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,390
I need five men and transport
for 20 kids or more.

59
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
We only have a few squad cars

60
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,100
and that rust bucket transporter.

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,760
That'll have to do. How are we on ammo?

62
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,330
Well, we got what we got from Penguin,

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,840
and we got a box of shotgun shells

64
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,150
and a box of nine mils.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,970
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

66
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,490
Do nothing, protect the Green Zone.

67
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,230
Four shells each. Half a mag each.

68
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,500
Boy said The Soothsayers are here.

69
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,620
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

70
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,476
but it's only three
or four miles from then on.

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,480
Three or four miles into the Dark Zone?

72
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,290
God only knows what's out there.

73
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,340
Barbara's been stockpiling vehicles

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,176
and everything else
as payment to enter her club.

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,916
- It's worth a shot.
- She's gonna be thrilled

76
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,680
to see you after what
happened with Tabitha.

77
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,746
We're gonna need housing
for those kids when we get back.

78
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,600
- Yep.

They came for help, too,

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,520

She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

She's helpless now.

No.

109
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,180
We sent for more of us.

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,600
Knock yourself out.

166
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,180
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

167
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,170
You won't last the night.

168
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,070
Here he comes, Gotham.

169
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,620
Your judge, your jailer,
your most hated son!

170
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,930
Have at him!

171
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,150
Rip him to shreds!

172
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,330
(door closes)

173
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,950
No one deserves to die more than he.

174
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,280
BULLOCK: <i>All right,
we're entering the Dark Zone.</i>

175
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,140
<i>Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

176
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,880
<i>This place was a cesspit</i>

177
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,180
before the rest of the world
turned its back on us.

178
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,860
I wonder what's left here now.

179
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,120
I doubt many stayed up here.

180
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,320
This whole grid never regained power.

181
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,760
(glass breaking)

182
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,300
(shouting)

183
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,630
Damn it! You were saying, Jim?

184
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
(shouts)

185
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,500
It's a freaking arrow, Jim.

186
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,570
It's a freaking arrow!

187
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,760
Welcome to the badlands.

188
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,710
(grunts) Come on.

189
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,460
- Come on, come on.
- (groans softly)

190
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,830
- Get up!
- (groans)

191
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,380
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Leave him alone.

192
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,120
Causing trouble again, Gabriel?

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,870
We need water and food.

194
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,250
Some of us haven't slept in two days.

195
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,240
You know, you could've woken me

196
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,360
when that sneaky rat left in the night.

197
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,220
But you didn't, and now, he's out there,

198
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,470
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

199
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,340
(exhales)

200
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,870
The smoke. You should take it.

201
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,190
It'll give you energy.

202
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,620
Inhale enough...

203
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,560
...and it'll let you see the future.

204
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,620
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

205
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,340
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

206
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,370
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

207
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,050
People will be forced
to do business with us.

208
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,580
Food, booze, guns,

209
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,450
smoke.

210
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,850
All will come from the tunnel.

211
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
We've been digging for over a month.

212
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,080
We've only gotten a hundred feet.

213
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,530
It's too narrow.

214
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,160
The roof is leaking. Once we hit
the river, it'll flood

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,230
- and kill anyone inside.
- So negative!

216
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,530
Gabriel.

217
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,530
Shame.

218
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,070
I had such high hopes for you.

219
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,080
That one day you would
wear the mask and share

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,430
in our good fortune.

221
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,180
Never mind.

222
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,350
MAN: Sykes.
Man, you got to come out front.

223
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,380
Who was on watch?!

224
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,090
GORDON: Put your weapons down.

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Is that James Gordon?

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
<i>The</i> James Gordon?

227
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,070
It's our lucky day, fellas.

228
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,250
Kill this one, and we're bullet rich!

229
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,750
In Penguin's graces we will be.

230
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,430
(guns clicking)

231
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,110
I said put 'em down.

232
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,160
Give us the kids
you're holding captive. We'll leave.

233
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,190
Kids?

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

235
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,280
What are the cattle prods for?

236
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,310
Fun.

237
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,560
Stay here.

238
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,730
He moves, kill him.

239
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,530
It's okay.

240
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
It's all right. I'm a cop.

241
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,770
Will's alive?

242
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,646
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

243
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,140
He did.

244
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
Will made it! He's alive!

245
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,160
- (cheering)
- We need the keys.

246
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,130
There are trucks outside.

247
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,210
We'll drive you to the Green Zone,

248
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,640
find you a new home.

249
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,120
Thank you. God bless you.

250
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,630
Okay, guys. We're gonna get out of here.

251
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,520
Gonna help us get out. One at a time.

252
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,680
Yeah, we're gonna be okay.

253
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,610
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

254
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,420
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

255
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,630
so it was either this or sexy nurse.

256
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,960
You know what?

257
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,300
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

258
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,800
Wrong. Penguin gave us a boatload.

259
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,400
Penguin wants your boss skinned.

260
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,330
Let's take 'em, boys.

261
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,130
Come on! Go! Go!

262
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,480
(gunfire)

263
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,570
(Bullock yells)

264
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,240
(gunfire continues)

265
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey!

266
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,290
Go!

267
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,380
(child screams)

268
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,110
You okay? Come on.

269
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,150
- Take cover! Go! Go!
- (whimpers)

270
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,300
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

271
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,150
(yelling)

272
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,300
(gasps softly)

273
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,690
Bruce?

274
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,320
(sighs)

275
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,320
Thank God.

276
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,330
You have to help me.

277
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,300
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

278
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,160
- you have to believe me.
- You'll forgive me

279
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,220
if I find it hard to do so.

280
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,310
It wasn't me.

281
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,580
- It was the park.
- The park?

282
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,910
The trees, the plants, the roots

283
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,280
underground...

284
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,600
They're speaking to one another.

285
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,340
When those men came to kill me...

286
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,960
(panting)

287
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,000
...the plants came to my protection.

288
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,450
Then maybe we can help each other.

289
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,490
I have...

290
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,460
a friend... who was shot.

291
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,220
The bullet severed her spinal cord.

292
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,660
The doctors can't seem to help her.

293
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,690
But a woman at the hospital said
that you might be able to.

294
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,300
Normally, I would say no.

295
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,340
But this park...
ever since we were cut off

296
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,710
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

297
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,560
There are things growing here
I have never seen before.

298
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,750
- (knocking)
- MAN: You okay in there?

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,720
Our friends are on their way.

300
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,110
Time's running out for you, witch!

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,510
There's a seed.

302
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,050
It's growing under the oaks.

303
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,230
It's said to have magical qualities.

304
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,900
When digested, it heads

305
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,380
for damaged tissue and bone,
healing them.

306
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,540
If I help you find it...

307
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,680
...will you protect me
from those men out there?

308
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,530
(gasps)

309
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,320
(chains rattle)

310
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,200
Yes! Yes!

311
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,010
Yes, it worked!

312
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,120
No... more...

313
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,140
sleepwalking for me.

314
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,250
(sighs)

315
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,900
Good morning.

316
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,390
(zipper opens)

317
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,720
(sighs)

318
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,210
See, it was just some...

319
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,190
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

320
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,650
(urinating)

321
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,480
It's all in your head.

322
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,440
(man groaning)

323
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,220
There's nothing there.

324
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,210
(laughs)

325
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,460
(sighs)

326
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,460
(man groaning)

327
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,600
(zipper closes)

328
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,390
(gasps) Who the hell are you?

329
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,890
What? Are you serious?

330
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,480
- Very.
- You don't remember?

331
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,030
- No.
- Oh.

332
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,130
Name's Tank.

333
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,400
You're part of the Street Demonz gang?

334
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,830
Yeah.

335
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,550
You know that.

336
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,620
Why should I?

337
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,240
What are you doing here?

338
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,380
You brought me here.

339
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,380
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

340
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,220
Did I, uh...

341
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,340
hit you, et cetera?

342
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,370
Any idea why?

343
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,340
You wanted information,

344
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,390
and I wouldn't give it to you.

345
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm gonna guess you gave it to me.

346
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,640
Huh. I can't remember.

347
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,190
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

348
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,570
Guess so.

349
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,380
Fine.

350
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,450
SYKES: Gordon, where are you?

351
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,710
We need to hide.

352
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,620
Follow me.

353
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,350
(door creaks closed)

354
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,390
It's not safe out there.

355
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,060
We've got to get out of the daylight.

356
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,260
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

357
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,440
We'll be fine.

358
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,390
Jim, we're not alone.

359
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,730
Someone lit that candle.

360
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,650
In the old west, settlers used
to leave a candle burning

361
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,600
to lead others to safety.

362
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,540
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

363
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,410
All right, fine.

364
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,190
We'll take a look around.

365
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,710
Stay here.

366
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,060
If you see something, shout.

367
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,610
Radio check.

368
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,670
Ah, forget it.

369
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,760
We're out of range of
the precinct's antenna.

370
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,300
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

371
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,460
maybe they'll send someone back
here to get us, huh?

372
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,290
Maybe. Until then, I'll take the
next floor, you do the basement.

373
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,570
Oh. Check out the basement in a
creepy hotel by myself? Sure.

374
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,290
What could go wrong, right?

375
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,520
(sighs)

376
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,450
Let's get settled.

377
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,540
(floorboards creaking)

378
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,720
(door creaks)

379
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,650
(creaking nearby)

380
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,240
Hello?

381
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,490
Is somebody there?

382
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,320
GCPD.

383
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,560
Come out, now.

384
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,510
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's all right.

385
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,570
(fire crackling)

386
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,370
♪ ♪

387
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,510
Oh, my God.

388
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,560
Oh. Not good.

389
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,220
Oh, God. This...

390
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,520
This is not good.

391
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,840
(shouts)

392
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,910
Jim!

393
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,870
(grunts)

394
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,010
Fine. I'll tell you.

395
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,470
You wanted to know where the
Street Demonz base was.

396
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,980
That's it?

397
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,440
And you wanted to be sure
the boss would be there.

398
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,530
- Emmanuel Vasquez?
- Yeah.

399
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,170
Okay. How did I seem?

400
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,420
Was I confident, flamboyant,

401
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,940
charisma for days?

402
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,190
Or a little more conservative,

403
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,830
kind of repressed, a little nerdy?

404
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,450
You seemed stiff, man of few words.

405
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,410
In a daze, actually.

406
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,460
Interesting.

407
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,420
Okay, let's go.

408
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,460
Where?

409
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,300
To where you told me to go.

410
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,380
To the Street Demonz' base.

411
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,960
To Vasquez.

412
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
I want to know why I went there.

413
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,140
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside. Lock the door.

414
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,340
Stay calm.

415
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,930
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

416
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
She's a witch,

417
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,040
and will burn for what she's done.

418
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,050
I take full responsibility for her.

419
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,250
If she's done what you say,

420
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,130
she will pay for her crimes, but...

421
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,430
You are so utterly naive.

422
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,360
You didn't have to kill them.

423
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,400
I wanted to.

424
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,120
Why are you here?

425
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm here for my friend.

426
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,290
Our friend.

427
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,620
Selina.

428
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,160
Selina's the one that's hurt?

429
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,540
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

430
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,250
Good.

431
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,420
That bitch destroyed the last
of the Lazarus Water.

432
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,010
Let her suffer.

433
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,060
I don't believe you mean that.

434
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,840
You've known each other for a long time.

435
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
You grew up on the streets together.

436
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,320
You know, I wasn't lying when
I said this park is changing.

437
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,740
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

438
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,000
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

439
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,150
I think I shall plant

440
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,870
your body in the ground, Bruce.

441
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,080
What will grow from you, I wonder?

442
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,260
Those men you killed were right.

443
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,820
You are a witch.

444
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,930
A murderous, callous witch.

445
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,240
You trying to bait me, boy?

446
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,410
I wouldn't waste my breath.

447
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I can see there's no good left in you.

448
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,760
If you were trying to
help this park flourish,

449
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,080
it would be full of beauty and color.

450
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,370
Instead it smells of death.

451
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,870
It's a work in progress.

452
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,990
It's a nightmare.

453
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,320
If I do help you, you'll leave me alone?

454
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,430
Follow me.

455
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,110
It's okay.

456
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm Jim. What's your name?

457
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,700
I-I can't remember.

458
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,000
Where are your parents?

459
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,150
Dead.

460
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,646
When the lights went out in the city,

461
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,450
a gang came, they murdered them. I ran.

462
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,450
- She found me.
- Who?

463
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,610
The ghost.

464
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,240
She was kind at first.

465
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,860
But she can be very cruel.

466
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,830
BULLOCK: Jim!

467
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,366
We're not alone. There's a crazy woman.

468
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,400
She's killing people.

469
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,120
The ghost. We got to go.

470
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,896
- She hates strangers.
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

471
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,426
We'll protect you from whoever she is.

472
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,670
- You can't.
- Why? Who is she?

473
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,570
She makes me call her Mother.

474
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,400
- We got to go.
- He's not lying! Come on, Jim.

475
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,550
Hey!

476
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,410
Hey! Come on!

477
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,380
Kid! (pounding on door)

478
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,650
Hey, kid!

479
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,170
The lights will make you dizzy.

480
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,450
And then you'll fall asleep.

481
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,160
You won't feel a thing.

482
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,460
(groaning)

483
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,050
Jim, I don't feel so good.

484
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,520
(grunts)

485
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,390
(door rattling)

486
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,280
BOY: You can't fight it. Give in to it.

487
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,260
BULLOCK: Jim!

488
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,420
(grunts)

489
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,060
- Who are you?
- I'm the only mother that boy knows.

490
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,140
You're a crazy bitch who kills people,

491
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,080
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

492
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,390
I'm protecting him.

493
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,070
When I found him, he was barely alive.

494
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,460
Those animals out there,

495
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,970
they would have killed him or worse.

496
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,880
I taught him how to survive.

497
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,310
(both grunting)

498

It was Ivy.

What's that?

568
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,600
Ivy said it could help Selina.

569
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,170
- What, and you trust her?
- What choice do I have?

570
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,250
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

571
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,540
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-blooded killer.

572
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,790
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

573
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,110
Selina, I have doubts.

574
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,710
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

575
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,390
Nothing's changed since then.

576
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,700
So if Ivy wants to kill me,

577
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,930
she can have at it.

578
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,540
What do I do, just swallow it?

I know Ivy's lost her mind.

584
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,110
But...

585
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,670
after her mom and dad died,
she was just...

586
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,670
sleeping on the streets.

587
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,770
And it was a cold winter, and...

588
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,650
she started to get really sick.

589
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,860
So I...

590
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,830
took her under my wing, I guess,

591
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,110
and...

592
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,940
showed her where to get food,

593
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,300
where to get a roof over her head.

594
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,380
And after some time,

595
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,100
she started to get color in her face.

596

(chuckles)

597
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,190
And I just...

598
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,610
kept checking in on her.

599
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,830
Almost every day.

600
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,200
She may look old now, but...

Her temperature skyrocketed.

666
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,390
Her WBC count was off the charts.

667
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,380
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

668
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,580
I have no idea why.

669
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,500
She was still in a lot of
pain, so we sedated her.

670
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,600
She's been sleeping for a while now.

671
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,120
I think it'd be best to
come back in the morning.

672
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,460
Thank you, Doctor.

673
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,600
Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should, uh...

674
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,220
we should get some shut-eye.

675
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,640
Come on.

676
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,610
♪ ♪

677
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,010
Bruce.

678
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,860
It's a miracle.

679
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,140
How do you feel?

680
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,340
(wind blowing)

681
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,720
Different.

682
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,120
Any pain?

683
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,540
No.

684
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,880
Selina, I thought I'd killed you.

685
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,140
I'm better.

686
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,000
Even better than before, in fact.

687
