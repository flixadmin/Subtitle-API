1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,750
How do I look?

2
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,000
Powerful.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,250
Beautiful.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,250
Martín...

5
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,458
for years,
you've been going around in circles...

6
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,291
feeling this way.

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,625
I think it's time you moved on.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,666
We can move on to wine, if you like.

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,250
-Shall we have a glass?
-No.

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,333
I'm not drinking that with you.

11
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to dinner. With Tatiana.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,625
-Right.
-You'll think about me,

13
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,750
but...

14
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,375
I won't think about you.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,083
You don't have to spell it out for me.
It's clear.

16
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,416
Oh, please. Do you think I don't love you?

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
I also feel that what we have between us

18
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,500
is extraordinary, unique, wonderful.

19
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,166
I know about love.
I've been married 5 times.

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,041
-OK.
-What I've never told you is that...

21
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,000
I've never felt anything
with any of those women

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,041
remotely similar to what I have with you.

23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,375
Not even close.

24
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,125
You and I are soul mates.

25
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,791
But only 99%.

26
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,833
As you know, I really like women.

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,833
And you like me too much.

28
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,250
And what's 1% against 99%?

29
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:13,541
-Unless you're not brave enough to try it.
-That 1% is a tiny mitochondrion...

30
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,916
but it defines my desire.

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,041
Mitochondrion.

32
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,208
Where's your desire?

33
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,166
Here?

34
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,291
Where is it?

35
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,541
Don't worry. Relax.

36
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,958
Don't be afraid.

37
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,750
You're a coward, huh?

38
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,125
Where is it?

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,166
Look...

40
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,208
I'd give anything to feel that, but...

41
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,666
it's impossible.

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,208
It's impossible.

43
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,500
I love you, Martín.

44
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,416
But my brother is right.
We must part ways.

45
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,250
And we have to scrap the plan.

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,041
Your son-of-a-bitch brother
told you I loved you

47
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,500
to break up this house.

48
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,500
You're going to go and make photocopies
in the Royal Mint, right?

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
I suggested melting gold together.

50
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,458
You're hooked on something
that will never exist!

51
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,833
I have to leave you. It's...

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,625
for love.

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,208
For brotherhood.

54
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
For the commitment I have to you.

55
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,916
Leave...

56
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,125
and heal the wound.

57
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,666
Sometimes distance
is the only way to find peace.

58
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,458
Farewell, my friend.

59
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,833
I'm sure that one way or another,
time will bring us back together.

60
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,333
<i>As Alicia Sierra</i>
<i>walked towards the slaughterhouse...</i>

61
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,791
<i>she wore an enigmatic smile</i>
<i>that no one noticed.</i>

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,125
<i>It was not the smile</i>
<i>of someone about to throw in the towel.</i>

63
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,791
Please, over here.

64
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,833
Is it true you sent for the daughter
of Ágata Jiménez, Nairobi,

65
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,875
so she'd go to the window
and you could shoot her?

66
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>-Did she die from that shot?</i>
-<i>That is untrue.</i>

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
It was a boy, not a girl.

68
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,291
Nine years old.

69
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,333
And yes, I sent for him.

70
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,791
<i>With the knowledge of my superiors,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

71
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,541
-What are you doing?
<i>-We shot her in the chest.</i>

72
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't allow a doctor to go in
to operate.

73
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
Antoñanzas, turn the volume up!

74
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,833
<i>Her friends saved her. All for nothing.</i>

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,083
<i>She was killed</i>
<i>by the Bank of Spain's head of security,</i>

76
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,041
Gandía,
with the backing of Colonel Tamayo.

77
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,666
-Fucking bitch.
-<i>It needs to be said.</i>

78
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,875
More questions.

79
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,291
<i>Is it true that this Osman--</i>

80
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,291
I don't know if you know him--

81
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,833
buried Cortés alive?

82
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,291
Yes, we buried him alive.

83
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,583
<i>In Timimoun...</i>

84
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,791
<i>Tamayo's world was falling apart.</i>

85
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,375
<i>Of course I know Osman.</i>
<i>He's a professional.</i>

86
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,958
<i>Capable of burying a man alive...</i>

87
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,875
<i>and leaving him shaking like a leaf</i>
<i>without him dying.</i>

88
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,625
<i>His public image was crumbling,</i>
<i>and the worst was yet to come.</i>

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,291
{\an8}<i>Inside the bank,</i>
<i>his big gamble was unconscious.</i>

90
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,208
{\an8}Palermo.

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
{\an8}-<i>How is he?</i>
-We're operating.

92
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,791
{\an8}<i>On a stretcher and badly wounded.</i>

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,875
{\an8}Save his life.

94
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,458
{\an8}Didn't you drug him?

95
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,416
{\an8}Drugs? We drugged him.

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,708
{\an8}Inhaled, to be precise.

97
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,458
{\an8}<i>We hung him up, threw cold water on him,</i>
<i>and he shat himself.</i>

98
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,166
{\an8}Everything the boy said
is absolutely and totally true.

99
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,500
{\an8}And there are plenty of things
that he forgot to say.

100
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,541
{\an8}Was the government aware of this?

101
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,416
{\an8}Aware?

102
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,333
{\an8}The government gave the orders.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,416
{\an8}I didn't wake up one day and say,
"I'll interrogate the boy hard."

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,375
{\an8}No! I had everyone's backing.

105
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,625
{\an8}The CNI, police commanders,
and the Ministry of the Interior.

106
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,583
{\an8}Absolutely everyone knew about it.

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,416
{\an8}And now you know. Thank you very much.

108
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,416
{\an8}<i>Alicia Sierra,</i>
<i>negotiator at the Bank of Spain,</i>

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,041
{\an8}<i>reveals all, and nobody is spared.</i>

110
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,375
{\an8}<i>She admits to torture</i>
<i>but holds the government responsible.</i>

111
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:05,250
{\an8}<i>The government gave the orders,</i>
<i>and she says, "Everyone knew."</i>

112
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,041
{\an8}We have to bury that bitch.

113
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,625
{\an8}<i>While all of Spain was glued to the TV,</i>

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,666
{\an8}<i>in a former Chinese restaurant</i>
<i>in Madrid,</i>

115
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,666
{\an8}<i>Benjamín and his men...</i>

116
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,458
{\an8}<i>were raising hell.</i>

117
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,750
{\an8}Marseille.

118
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,833
{\an8}Arriving at extraction point.

119
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,250
{\an8}Received.

120
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,666
{\an8}One, two, three.

121
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,833
<i>How many meters?</i>

122
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,500
Four meters.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,666
I need you to work faster.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,166
Lisbon will be guarded by 26 officers,
split between seven vehicles.

125
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,416
Three behind...

126
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,750
and three in front.

127
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,666
In the middle, the van she'll be in.

128
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,708
<i>They'll go to the National Court first</i>
<i>and then to the prison.</i>

129
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,750
What's the most vulnerable point?

130
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,625
On the road. From point A to B.

131
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,333
-No.
-In the courtroom?

132
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,750
No.

133
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,583
-Are we going to tunnel into the prison?
-No.

134
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,416
But there is a place that is vulnerable.

135
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,083
We've all seen it.

136
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,916
<i>On TV.</i>

137
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:14,875
<i>When the National Court's entrance is</i>
<i>full of journalists, what do the cops do?</i>

138
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,750
<i>They take the prisoner...</i>

139
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,791
through the parking garage.

140
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,666
<i>Only the van goes in.</i>

141
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,666
In 30 seconds, that armored convoy
goes from having 26 officers...

142
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,166
<i>to six. And from seven vehicles...</i>

143
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,833
to one.

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,416
{\an8}POLICE

145
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,208
And a parking garage is not a bunker
or a high-security prison.

146
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
-It's...
-A parking garage.

147
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,458
Exactly.

148
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,166
<i>From the National Court parking garage</i>

149
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,958
to the basement of our restaurant,

150
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
there are exactly...

151
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,041
11 meters and 68 centimeters of sandstone.

152
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,166
Sandstone. You are Asturian miners.

153
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,833
-The best.
-What's that to you?

154
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,458
Nothing. Pick, shovel, grinder.

155
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,875
<i>Minimum noise, maximum efficiency.</i>

156
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,333
<i>Ten hours, Benjamín, to have it ready.</i>

157
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,500
-And the extraction?
-Silent industrial machinery.

158
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,291
<i>We'll take the rubble to the kitchen.</i>

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,791
<i>It'll be a clean and quick operation.</i>

160
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,500
<i>Benjamín?</i>

161
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,875
Five meters.

162
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:03,958
Palermo.

163
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,250
I'm listening, Professor.

164
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,041
<i>How is he?</i>

165
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,541
He's conscious.

166
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,791
<i>General physical condition?</i>

167
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:23,291
He can't move one arm.<i> </i>He's lost blood.
He can hardly breathe.

168
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,583
<i>He's a total wreck.</i>

169
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,083
But will he recover?

170
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,875
If I were his mother,
I'd be lighting candles.

171
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,708
I'm telling you that he'll recover.

172
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,833
I'll make sure of it personally.

173
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,833
<i>Even if I have to be with him</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

174
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,125
But I'll make you better.

175
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,333
I'll feed you soup.
I'll make you strong again.

176
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,333
And when you're as strong as an ox,
do you know what will happen?

177
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
I'll kill you.

178
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,458
I'll beat you to death.

179
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,541
Why the fuck are we saving
this motherfucker's life?

180
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,416
-<i>Can he speak?</i>
<i>-</i>So far, he's not saying much.

181
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,125
My name is Stockholm. Do you remember me?

182
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,916
Let go of me, fucking bitch, scumbag.

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,833
Let go.

184
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,625
Professor, he can talk.

185
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,416
He killed Nairobi.

186
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What the fuck are we doing?

187
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,500
<i>-We have to kill him!</i>
-That'll depend on him, Rio.

188
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,000
If he wants to live, he'll live.

189
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,041
If he wants to die...

190
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,000
<i>he'll die.</i>

191
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,791
It depends on him?

192
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,958
You can't say that.

193
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,833
<i>You have no clue</i>
<i>how we're feeling in here.</i>

194
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,833
You don't know what it's like
to look him in the eyes.

195
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,875
-Tokyo...
<i>-Don't talk to me like you're my dad.</i>

196
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,208
Do you know how I feel?

197
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
Do you know how Helsinki feels?

198
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,708
Helsinki... is stitching him up.

199
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,958
<i>He's treating him.</i>
<i>Do you know who he treated before? No.</i>

200
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,291
You don't know. Of course you don't.

201
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,833
You don't know anything.
You're hiding like a rat.

202
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,833
That's how you keep giving orders
after Nairobi's death,

203
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:16,708
without shedding a tear.
You feel nothing!

204
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,416
Enough!

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,958
You feel nothing!

206
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,000
Stop.

207
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,208
-Nothing!
-Stop!

208
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,833
Do you want to feed him soup too?

209
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,000
Tokyo, I would take him

210
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,208
and I'd stick a burning iron through him.

211
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,750
I'd take him down to the foundry,

212
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,166
and I'd put his head in the furnace
to finish him off.

213
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,125
You think I'm not hurting over Nairobi?
That the Professor isn't too?

214
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,541
Doesn't seem like it.

215
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,416
<i>He's a prisoner.</i>

216
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,791
And we don't kill prisoners.

217
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,166
As much as it pains us,
we don't kill prisoners.

218
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,000
Nor do we kill in cold blood.

219
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
But he did!

220
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,583
He killed Nairobi! She was sick.
She was unarmed. She'd surrendered!

221
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,916
We had a truce, for fuck's sake!

222
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,500
Now it's about saving our lives, Rio,
like we saved yours.

223
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,375
<i>That involves collateral damage,</i>
<i>like swallowing the pain.</i>

224
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,416
<i>We've run out of time.</i>
<i>They broke the truce.</i>

225
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
<i>We have to turn this situation around.</i>

226
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,833
Helsinki.

227
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,291
Helsinki!

228
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,416
Helsinki, no!

229
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,083
-No!
-Why did you kill her,

230
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,125
you son of a bitch?

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,041
Why'd you kill her?

232
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,250
Palermo.

233
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Helsinki, look at me.

234
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,208
Look me in the eyes.

235
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,625
Helsinki!

236
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,875
Come on, brother.

237
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,208
Rio, Denver.

238
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,500
Get to work.

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,833
Now.

240
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,541
<i>Palermo?</i>

241
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,666
He's alive, sir.

242
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,708
Son of a bitch.

243
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,166
Are you having one?

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,833
You're having an anxiety thing.

245
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,000
It was very tense up there.

246
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,041
It'll pass in a minute.

247
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,125
I already know I'm fucked, Commissioner.
You don't need to remind me.

248
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,208
-What I want to know is what happened.
-Call them.

249
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,125
I've been a negotiator for 15 years.
I know when a deal's been accepted.

250
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,000
Call them.
You'll be with them in 24 hours.

251
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,458
We won't come after you.

252
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,000
She was against the ropes.
She was going to sell the Professor out.

253
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,500
<i>I'd worn her down.</i>
<i>I'd almost defeated her.</i>

254
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,791
<i>Then something happened.</i>

255
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,916
But what can happen
when someone is incommunicado?

256
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,916
Maybe she wasn't incommunicado.

257
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,333
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.

258
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,916
Don't let anyone in.

259
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
<i>Antoñanzas?</i>

260
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
What do you think...

261
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:38,916
Commissioner?

262
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,541
Should we go after Antoñanzas?

263
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,000
Smart creature.

264
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,875
It's really like a vacation.

265
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,958
I'll come back for you, Commissioner.

266
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,333
<i>Court proceedings have been initiated</i>
<i>against Alicia Sierra</i>

267
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
<i>and a warrant issued for her arrest.</i>

268
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,208
<i>The police negotiator</i>
<i>could be the first arrest</i>

269
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,958
<i>in the Bank of Spain heist,</i>
<i>absurd as it sounds.</i>

270
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,750
<i>She's accused of false imprisonment</i>
<i>and torture</i>

271
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,666
<i>following the press conference</i>
<i>from the Ministry of the Interior.</i>

272
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,958
<i>The minister, the director of the CNI,</i>
<i>and police commanders</i>

273
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>are preparing libel and slander lawsuits</i>
<i>against the inspector.</i>

274
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,291
<i>Confirmed.</i>
<i>Interior requests her immediate arrest.</i>

275
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,166
Go after her!

276
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,458
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm directly responsible
for all this shit.

278
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,000
I didn't calculate the pain
it'd cause you. I'm sorry.

279
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,916
What do you know about pain, Palermo?

280
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,416
Pain is a loan shark.

281
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,791
It leaves you with a debt
that you can never pay back.

282
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,708
I can take pain.

283
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,541
A lot of pain.

284
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:34,250
Oh, yeah?
What about the pain you're feeling now?

285
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,625
It's different, right?

286
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,958
I saw it in your eyes.

287
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,208
It was like seeing myself in the mirror.

288
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,750
<i>You have no idea...</i>

289
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,875
<i>where you'll fall.</i>

290
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
Get out of there now.

291
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,000
Otherwise, you run the risk of...
becoming a piece of shit like me.

292
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:09,416
This horrible monster I've turned into.
A guy who destroys everything he touches.

293
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,750
Someone who's wanted to die
for many years.

294
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,708
And you can't get out of there.
You never get out.

295
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,958
Look, brother.

296
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,041
All that "boom, boom, ciao" crap...

297
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,333
I treated you like shit.

298
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,375
I didn't dare. I couldn't.
I didn't know how.

299
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,333
But let me say, I'm by your side.
I won't let you fall.

300
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,583
I know.

301
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,458
I've known from the start.

302
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,208
I know who you are.

303
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,458
My name is Martín Berrote.

304
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:55,416
I was born in Buenos Aires,
but I live in Palermo, Sicily.

305
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,666
I'm going to get you out of here alive.
Even if I have to die doing it.

306
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,750
My name is Mirko Dragic.

307
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm from Belgrade.

308
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,125
I lost Oslo in the Mint.

309
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,916
I lost Nairobi.

310
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,416
And I'm not losing anyone else.

311
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,250
You included, Martín Berrote.

312
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,583
{\an8}NATIONAL COURT
09:34 HOURS

313
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,500
{\an8}<i>Lisbon will start testifying</i>
<i>at the National Court.</i>

314
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,750
<i>She'll give reliable, specific details,</i>
<i>earning the judge's trust.</i>

315
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,916
<i>And she'll do it meticulously</i>
<i>because all of this...</i>

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,958
is part of the Paris Plan.

317
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,250
What is the Paris Plan?

318
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,375
A rescue plan
in case either of us is caught.

319
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,625
But why Paris?

320
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,916
Because Paris is the city of freedom.

321
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,291
And of love.

322
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,500
Who hasn't strolled around Paris in love?
Right, boys?

323
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,458
What will Lisbon tell the judge?

324
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,333
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

325
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
And in fact, she'll start with love.

326
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,875
How did you reunite with Sergio Marquina?
Did you arrange it?

327
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,041
I met him a year after we escaped,

328
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,916
<i>in Palawan in the Philippines.</i>

329
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,541
He left me a puzzle with coordinates.
He might not look it, but he's romantic.

330
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,666
She'll tell them everything.

331
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,416
Everything: where we lived,
how often we relocated.

332
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,916
After an hour and a half,
she'll tell them the plan.

333
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,083
What do you mean?

334
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,875
-She can't do that.
-She can.

335
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,291
Truth is the basis of trust,
and that's a fact.

336
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,625
The plan's to steal 90 tons of gold
from the national reserve.

337
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,958
We're melting it.

338
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,250
-They're melting it in there?
-Of course.

339
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,791
By now, they'll have done around 50 tons.

340
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,041
We're using industrial furnaces
made by Hormund.

341
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,125
Hormund.

342
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,833
German. They're the best.

343
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,125
-Benjamín, how are we doing?
<i>-</i>Seven and a half meters!

344
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,333
Faster.

345
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,625
Faster!

346
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,958
We'll give them all the details.

347
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,708
They reach 2,300ºC,
and gold melts at 1,064ºC.

348
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,083
We'll overwhelm them
with technical details, so their brains...

349
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,291
have to keep processing information.

350
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:41,166
We knew that the vault floods
at a rate of 7,500 liters a minute.

351
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,125
Very detailed information.

352
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,666
And we'll do that to...

353
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,291
-tire them out.
-That's right.

354
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,583
The challenge
was the interconnection tube.

355
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,500
Can I have some paper and a pen?

356
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,541
I'm going to tire you out.

357
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,833
-Meters?
-Nine meters!

358
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,750
Faster.

359
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,541
<i>The vault door...</i>

360
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,875
14 tons of steel...

361
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,833
We had to cut a circle in it
in just minutes...

362
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,166
The bathyscaphe floods...

363
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,250
The diver enters...
We weld the tube...

364
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:15,083
...to equalize the pressure...
...it comes out the other side.

365
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,541
A bit like this.

366
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Have some dinner brought in.

367
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:30,500
<i>They say that pregnant women</i>
<i>have a sharper sense of smell.</i>

368
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,333
<i>It was perhaps the only thing</i>
<i>the Professor hadn't foreseen.</i>

369
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,750
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>someone had picked up his scent</i>

370
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,208
<i>without him sensing it.</i>

371
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,333
<i>Antoñanzas's wife</i>
<i>had not yet seen the news.</i>

372
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,875
-Marisa?
-<i>Sierra took less than 3 minutes</i>

373
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,958
<i>to get the information she needed.</i>

374
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:55,083
-I'm a colleague of Benito's.
-I know who you are.

375
00:26:56,083 --> 00:27:00,333
Let me see, where do I begin?
Benito has been acting...

376
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:04,750
-weird lately, nervous...
<i>-Antoñanzas had seemed anxious at home.</i>

377
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>So much so,</i>
<i>he'd been swimming late at night</i>

378
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,625
<i>with two friends in the pool.</i>

379
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,125
<i>And it seemed like he was drunk.</i>

380
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,875
<i>Colonel, Sierra isn't at home.</i>
<i>She must have fled.</i>

381
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,958
Fucking bitch.

382
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,625
All units, an arrest warrant's been issued
for Alicia Sierra.

383
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,500
I can't give you the footage
even if you are an officer.

384
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,125
I need permission from a judge
or the residents' association president.

385
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh wait, someone's calling me.

386
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,000
It's the residents' association president.

387
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,291
How are you, President?

388
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,500
OK, thank you.

389
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,458
He says yes.

390
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,000
Give me the tapes of the entrance,

391
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:01,583
the pool, the parking lot, the street...
All of them.

392
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,750
Listen, Amanda.

393
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,791
What you did before...

394
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,875
Making unfounded accusations against me--

395
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,791
-I don't want to hear it. Leave me alone.
-Look--

396
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:32,166
Didn't you hear her? Leave her alone.
Don't make me kick you out of here.

397
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,416
What are you doing?

398
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,833
Everyone quiet, now!

399
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,375
You're despicable. You make me cringe.

400
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,958
You're calling me despicable? You?

401
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,125
A banker.

402
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,291
A puppet of the system and of capitalism.

403
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,250
<i>You're</i> giving <i>me</i> lessons in ethics?

404
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,666
A man who didn't have the balls
to defend his workers

405
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,708
-and face the terrorists.
-Enough!

406
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,416
On the ground!

407
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,791
Hands behind your head!

408
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,500
Come on. All right!

409
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,833
You, over there!

410
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:09,083
-Arturo!
-Everyone on their feet.

411
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,916
I'll get you out, I promise.

412
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,791
All of you! That's the difference
between you and me, Governor.

413
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,416
I came to save all these people,
to be a hero.

414
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,291
While you piss your pants
at the slightest thing.

415
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,458
-Governor.
-Arturo.

416
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,375
She's got a gun.

417
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,541
You're going to put that G36 on the floor
in the next three seconds.

418
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,375
If you don't, you're dead.

419
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,541
Who are you?
If you don't mind me asking.

420
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,625
Manila. Undercover agent for the gang.

421
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,625
Well, look...

422
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,833
Manila, I don't buy a word of it.

423
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:49,000
And that gun is one of the fake ones
they give us.

424
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,166
You don't fool me.

425
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,958
You have two seconds.
Put the gun down,

426
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,583
and pray it's not true you raped Amanda.

427
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,708
You're pissing me off.
I'm losing my patience.

428
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,000
-One.
-So--

429
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,583
I didn't rape her.

430
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,541
I just gave her some anxiety meds.

431
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,958
I'm bleeding out.

432
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,625
I'm dying.

433
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,041
You're not. There's an exit wound.

434
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,041
There are no arteries
or anything important there.

435
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:24,666
Arturo, you're under arrest,
accused of rape.

436
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:25,916
And...

437
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:33,750
may I remind you
that you offered me pills too, scumbag.

438
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,041
<i>That night in the bank, no one slept.</i>

439
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,125
<i>But the worst news</i>

440
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:45,291
<i>was that, outside,</i>
<i>our biggest enemy was wasting no time.</i>

441
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,958
<i>Sierra saw Antoñanzas fall.</i>
<i>She saw him hit the springboard.</i>

442
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:57,375
<i>Seconds later,</i>
<i>the Professor and Marseille appeared.</i>

443
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,833
<i>It was 3:11 in the morning.</i>

444
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,250
<i>Minutes later, she had the license plate.</i>

445
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,666
What's up, cutie?

446
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,291
<i>-Fuck, Alicia, don't give me shit.</i>
<i>-</i>Take it easy.

447
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,458
I have a license plate
from April 7 at 3:00 a.m.

448
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:30,791
It left a street off the M-30.
I need to know where it went.

449
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,416
<i>You're a wanted woman.</i>
<i>I'm taking a risk.</i>

450
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,208
How many times
have I taken risks for you, Raúl?

451
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,583
Should I remind you of the last time?
Don't fuck with me.

452
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,708
Meters?

453
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,166
Nine and a half!

454
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,291
Lisbon's mission...

455
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,083
is to buy us the time we need.

456
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,125
You see...

457
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,708
people can concentrate
for about 50 minutes.

458
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,708
However important that information is,

459
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,375
there's a point
when you can't take any more.

460
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,250
They'll have no choice
but to continue the next day.

461
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,041
Do you know anything
about underwater welding?

462
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:16,000
Or about how to use
a thermic lance underwater?

463
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,375
In water, you cut metal with fire.

464
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,000
Fire? Underwater?

465
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,416
-How are we doing?
-Ten meters!

466
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,333
Faster.

467
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,708
Faster!

468
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,708
Fire underwater
to get to the state secrets,

469
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,083
key to the negotiation.

470
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,958
But it didn't work.
We had to use the dolphin.

471
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,541
A dolphin?

472
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,083
Ten and a half.

473
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,625
Flipper is the name we gave
the governor of the Bank of Spain.

474
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,916
It was the fastest way
to get the secrets and negotiate.

475
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,916
That's an act of coercion.

476
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,083
-I know.
-And disclosure of secrets.

477
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,833
We sent the secrets to an external server.

478
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:55,625
Lend me the pencil,
and I can outline how the IT system works.

479
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,875
It's almost one in the morning.

480
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,666
Maybe we should take a break.

481
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,416
If the prosecution
and the defense agree...

482
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,333
<i>She'll go back to prison.</i>

483
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,750
And we'll keep chipping away...

484
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,000
and chipping away.

485
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:22,541
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we'll have drilled through

486
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,791
the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel.

487
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:30,000
And at last...
we'll access the parking garage.

488
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,666
-Questions?
-How do we get into the garage

489
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,583
without being seen?

490
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,625
Good!

491
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,333
Very good question.

492
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,791
In two stages. First: Pakistan.

493
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,916
-Pakistan.
-Yes.

494
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,833
And you'll give the order.

495
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,541
The mole is out for a walk.

496
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Shakir.

497
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,500
-Shakir, now.
-Perfect, Professor.

498
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:07,166
From Pakistan, they'll change the signal
of the internal CCTV.

499
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,291
<i>And from then on,</i>
<i>the guards will see a recording.</i>

500
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,916
Stage two: Marseille.

501
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:20,541
Marseille will be
at that critical point on a night out,

502
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,791
when all the bars in Madrid
have closed, but...

503
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,458
you want to keep dancing
with your new hookup,

504
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,833
Sheila.

505
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:31,958
Marseille.

506
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
Speaking.

507
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,250
-Benjamín?
-Speaking.

508
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:40,250
And that will drown out the noise
of the angle grinders.

509
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,833
Stopwatches.

510
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,125
Three, two...

511
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,250
<i>one...</i>

512
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,083
now.

513
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,750
Now.

514
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,250
Good evening. Is there a problem?

515
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,208
What the hell are you doing?

516
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,791
Having a party. All the bars are closed.

517
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,666
So we're having a little party
here in the car.

518
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,708
<i>Marseille, hang on.</i>

519
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,083
Hang on, Marseille.

520
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,791
One minute!

521
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,000
What sort of party is it
with alcohol-free beer?

522
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,833
Well, I want to make love tonight.

523
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,791
And with alcohol...

524
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,791
And without alcohol...

525
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,750
Turn off the music.

526
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,208
Benjamín!

527
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,375
Thirty seconds!

528
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,833
Don't turn it off, Marseille.

529
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,750
-What?
-Turn off the music.

530
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,958
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

531
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,875
-Turn off the damn music.
-Hold on, Marseille.

532
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,083
-Get out of the car.
-<i>Hold on.</i>

533
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,416
<i>Ten seconds!</i>

534
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,333
-Get out.
-Five seconds!

535
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,750
<i>The burrow is open.</i>

536
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,250
We're in.

537
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,916
OK.

538
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,916
Get out of here.

539
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,208
We're in.

540
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,750
Benjamín.

541
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:00,875
<i>Stage three.</i>

542
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,416
Roger that.

543
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,166
Hello.

544
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,875
<i>M-607.</i>

545
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:19,000
<i>The last CCTV sighting was</i>
<i>at kilometer 29, the Colmenar Viejo exit.</i>

546
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,416
Eight in the morning on the second day...
the last stage begins.

547
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,958
<i>That's when Lisbon will leave</i>
<i>Soto del Real prison,</i>

548
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,291
<i>guarded by the same convoy</i>
<i>as the day before.</i>

549
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,875
She's just left the prison.

550
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,500
<i>Get ready.</i>

551
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,208
Tokyo, get Gandía ready.

552
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,416
<i>At 8:35, she'll arrive</i>
<i>at the National Court.</i>

553
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,208
<i>The entrance</i>
<i>will still be full of journalists.</i>

554
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,583
They'll repeat the same procedure.

555
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,250
<i>They'll go into the parking garage.</i>

556
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,208
<i>But there's one difference...</i>

557
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,208
you will already be there.

558
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,916
But nobody will be able to see you.

559
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,416
Because overnight...

560
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
you'll have built a false wall.

561
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,875
Jeez, Louise!

562
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,916
<i>You'll have three hours to build that wall</i>

563
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,333
<i>before the first National Court employees</i>
<i>arrive at 7:00 a.m.</i>

564
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,750
That wall

565
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,666
<i>will be just small enough</i>
<i>that no one will notice it,</i>

566
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,250
<i>but big enough for you to hide behind.</i>

567
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,125
Perfect.

568
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,083
And then comes
the David Copperfield moment.

569
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:11,208
How to extract someone

570
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,958
<i>from a van guarded by six other vehicles</i>
<i>and surrounded by civil guards</i>

571
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,583
without anyone realizing.

572
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,166
How to do it so that life goes on...

573
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
as if nothing had happened.

574
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,000
For that, we need to move
the next piece on the board.

575
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,208
And it's an essential piece.

576
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,416
The time has come...
for you to decide your fate:

577
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,541
life or death.

578
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,583
We've reconnected your equipment.

579
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,875
You'll call the tent,
you'll speak to Tamayo,

580
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,458
and you'll say you killed Nairobi.

581
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,625
Fucking son of a bitch.

582
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,208
And killed me too.

583
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,708
That we haven't found the panic room yet,

584
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,583
but that we're about to.

585
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,833
That you're going out
and that you've got a radio.

586
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,333
What's up?

587
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,375
Am I turning you on
like when I rammed the shrapnel into you?

588
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,000
Get to it.

589
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,750
<i>Command center.</i>

590
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,291
It's César Gandía.

591
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:54,500
Head of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

592
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,125
It's a ruse. They caught me!
They're trying to set you up!

593
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,458
<i>Gandía...</i>

594
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,000
it's the Professor.

595
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,916
<i>We fully expected you to do this,</i>

596
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,458
<i>but that was your one chance</i>
<i>to get it wrong.</i>

597
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,666
<i>The next call will be to Tamayo.</i>

598
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,541
<i>-Do it again...</i>
-Think of your son, Juanito.

599
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,541
<i>...and Tokyo will kill you.</i>

600
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,333
You hear me, Tokyo?

601
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,500
-Loud and clear.
-<i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

602
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:28,750
You'll hang up... and you'll kill him.

603
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,250
<i>I want you to understand one thing.</i>

604
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,750
<i>You can't win now.</i>
<i>You've already lost. Do you understand?</i>

605
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,208
The heroic thing to do
is to see your wife and son again.

606
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,958
<i>If not, they'll lose you.</i>

607
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,583
They'll lose you.

608
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,083
<i>Do you hear me, Tokyo?</i>

609
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,666
Get to it.

610
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,583
Suárez.

611
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,291
Martínez!

612
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:10,791
Colonel!

613
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,916
It's Gandía.

614
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,458
Gandía, I'm here.

615
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,041
Colonel, I'm in the panic room.

616
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,833
They're about to find it.

617
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,083
I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.

618
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,750
<i>I'm launching another attack.</i>

619
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,333
I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.

620
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,625
-I want all units on alert.
-Alpha and Beta units, get ready.

621
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:35,916
<i>-Everyone ready and on alert.</i>
<i>-</i>Go.

622
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,291
Four, six, two,

623
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,083
point, six, six, two.

624
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,625
Come with us.

625
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,875
If we don't get Lisbon
when she arrives, what do we do?

626
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,583
Wait in the wall for 10 hours?

627
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:59,833
This time, it'll take her
less than 20 minutes to come back.

628
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,791
<i>They'll insist, of course,</i>
<i>but she'll be within her rights.</i>

629
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,916
I've decided not to testify.

630
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,541
Mrs. Murillo, yesterday
you seriously incriminated yourself.

631
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,916
I advise you not to backtrack.

632
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,791
You could get penal benefits.

633
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:22,458
The judge will be forced
to send her to prison.

634
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:26,916
The same guards who took her in
will take her back to the parking garage.

635
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:31,208
But no one will be watching,
because the security control room

636
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>will be seeing the recording</i>
<i>from the night before.</i>

637
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,791
<i>The first time Lisbon arrived.</i>

638
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,166
<i>And then,</i>

639
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,041
they'll cross paths with...

640
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,916
a judge... a prosecutor...

641
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,958
a police officer...

642
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,291
and two lawyers.

643
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,375
Well, maybe you should be the prisoner.

644
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Benjamín.

645
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,125
-Everyone ready?
-Ready.

646
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,416
Now.

647
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,666
-<i>Benjamín.</i>
-I see her.

648
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,208
Twenty-five meters.

649
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,083
Ten meters.

650
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,208
The signal will be...

651
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
"Good morning."

652
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,916
Three meters.

653
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,000
Good morning.

654
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,333
-Good morning, Ms. Lisbon.
-Hello.

655
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,416
Let's go.

656
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,583
We won't make it easy for them:
within 45 seconds,

657
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,625
they'll have explosives
strapped to their chests.

658
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:22,583
<i>Within 55, two cameras and two microphones</i>
<i>will be watching them</i> <i>so that...</i>

659
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,416
if they change the route...

660
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,416
Boom.

661
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,708
If they attempt to raise the alarm...

662
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,250
Boom.

663
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,500
If you don't drive the prisoner
back to the prison...

664
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,500
Boom.

665
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,166
Are we taking the prisoner or not?

666
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,000
We'll give them another Lisbon.

667
00:45:59,125 --> 00:45:59,958
Officers...

668
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,583
everything OK? You're taking a long time.

669
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,916
Yes, everything's fine.

670
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,750
-We're coming up now.
-<i>OK, understood.</i>

671
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,625
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the great magic trick begins.</i>

672
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,166
<i>The climax</i>
<i>of the David Copperfield show.</i>

673
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,666
-Who is this Copperfield?
-The magician.

674
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,208
-Wasn't that Harry Potter?
-It'll seem like nothing's changed.

675
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,041
But it won't be.

676
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,458
<i>Because we'll have someone crawling</i>
<i>through the tunnel at top speed.</i>

677
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,041
Come on.

678
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,000
Come on.

679
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,166
Let's go.

680
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,375
Tokyo...

681
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,791
<i>Lisbon is on the way.</i>

682
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:30,250
<i>Begin the countdown... now.</i>

683
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,041
Run!

684
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,916
Colonel, they're shooting!

685
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,916
Gandía!

686
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,166
-<i>Gandía, answer me.</i>
-Gandía here.

687
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,583
Gandía here!

688
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,875
-They're closing in on me.
-They're closing in on me.

689
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:48,083
-I'm caught in the cross fire.
-Good.

690
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,541
Up you go.

691
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,125
-Where are you? Can we give cover fire?
-Negative.

692
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,541
<i>Negative, Colonel.</i>

693
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,458
-I'm going to the roof.
-I'm going to the roof.

694
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:03,333
-I request evacuation.
-<i>I request evacuation!</i>

695
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,750
Suárez, send a helicopter, now.

696
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,875
-Come on!
-Delta 1, prepare for takeoff.

697
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,000
Rescue operation at the Bank of Spain,
now!

698
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,208
Hold on, Gandía.

699
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,166
I have an M16 and 3 magazines.

700
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>I don't know how long I can hold out.</i>

701
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,958
Fire. Now.

702
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,958
-They started a fire.
-They're starting a fire. I can't see!

703
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,833
Colonel.

704
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,083
<i>Smoke on the roof.</i>

705
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,333
Hold on. The helicopter's coming.

706
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:54,625
Lisbon.

707
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,500
-Marseille.
-Marseille.

708
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,625
We have Lisbon.

709
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,333
Switch to blanks.

710
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,958
Let's go!

711
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:29,750
<i>Where will you get a military helicopter?</i>

712
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,791
The same place we got the vehicles
for the heist: the black market.

713
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,875
Not only that,
we'll intercept their communications

714
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:43,166
so that when they contact the helicopter,
it'll be us who answer.

715
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,166
<i>Where's the helicopter?</i>

716
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,500
Delta, position.

717
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,916
Time?

718
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,750
Two minutes, fifty seconds.

719
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,500
-Two minutes, 50 seconds.
-Go to the roof. We'll cover you.

720
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,416
I can't.
There's plastic explosive on the door.

721
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,750
-For fuck's sake! Bomb disposal!
-Bomb disposal!

722
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,333
-Describe the device.
-Blue wire to the primer.

723
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,666
There's a movement sensor
and a blue wire to the primer.

724
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,291
Cut it. It's a simple device.

725
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,333
-You sure?
-Yes.

726
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,625
-No!
-Cut it.

727
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,041
No. Colonel!

728
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,041
-Wire cut.
-Wire cut!

729
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,375
Denver, now.

730
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,375
I'm in black. Don't shoot.

731
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,666
-Door.
-Exiting now.

732
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,500
I'm wearing black and a ski mask.
Hold fire.

733
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,250
Our man's in black. Cover him.

734
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,958
<i>-Be ready for possible cross fire.</i>
-<i>Copy.</i>

735
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,875
<i>Switch to blanks.</i>

736
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:47,958
Go!

737
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,166
Let's go!

738
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,708
They're on the roof. They're firing!

739
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,583
Cover fire!

740
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,458
<i>There's smoke. I don't have a shot.</i>

741
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,416
-<i>Tokyo, now.</i>
-Palermo?

742
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,750
Open.

743
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,333
-<i>Searching for target.</i>
-<i>No visual.</i>

744
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,166
<i>I've got them. I see them!</i>

745
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,666
<i>Target in sight.</i>

746
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,500
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

747
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,750
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

748
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,875
-<i>They're shooting at us!</i>
-Motherfuckers.

749
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,250
<i>We're exposed.</i>

750
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,333
-They're exposed!
-<i>Take cover!</i>

751
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,166
<i>We're retreating to cover.</i>

752
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,083
Delta, begin approach maneuver.
Rescue protocol.

753
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,416
I want a quick, clean extraction.

754
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,416
Marseille.

755
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,916
-Arriving.
-Helicopter in position.

756
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,875
-Get it down there!
-Go ahead.

757
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,041
-Permission to descend, sir!
-Proceed.

758
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,458
Back in the helicopter, now!

759
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,208
Lisbon!

760
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,916
-Denver!
<i>-</i>Welcome to the Bank of Spain!

761
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,375
Package delivered, Professor.
I'll be out in two minutes.

762
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,750
Where's the helicopter going?

763
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:09,041
Delta 1, what's going on?
Return to your position!

764
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,708
-Delta 1, come in!
-Fuck!

765
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,875
There's a problem with the helicopter.
We're gonna tackle them.

766
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:29,083
Where'd that agent come from?
What balls.

767
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,541
They're retreating.

768
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,416
Are you OK?

769
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,666
Yes?

770
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,541
What?

771
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,083
A call from Soto del Real.
The convoy that transferred Murillo.

772
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:05,791
I have a woman here who was kidnapped
as she left the hairdressers.

773
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,416
What do I care?
This is the command center for the heist!

774
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,750
Here, asshole.

775
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,083
Gandía, hold on!

776
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,791
Stay on the stairs
till the helicopter returns.

777
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,833
Where's the fucking helicopter?

778
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:21,708
Colonel...

779
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,541
-What?
-Colonel.

780
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,250
The situation seems to be... a trick.

781
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:48,166
-Yes!
-Come on!

782
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,083
Yes!

783
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,666
Fuck yeah!

784
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,125
-Yes!
-Professor.

785
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,666
<i>Lisbon is with us.</i>

786
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,916
<i>I repeat, Lisbon is with us!</i>

787
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,833
Fuck yeah!

788
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,458
<i>Listen to me.</i>

789
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,250
This war...

790
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,708
We're going to win.

791
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,333
For Nairobi.

792
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,458
For Nairobi.

793
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,500
For Nairobi.

794
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,625
For Nairobi.

795
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,875
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

796
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,208
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

797
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,250
For Nairobi.

798
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,458
For Nairobi!

799
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,000
For Nairobi!

800
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,875
For Nairobi!

801
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,791
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

802
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,958
For Nairobi!

803
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,708
For Nairobi!

804
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,500
For Nairobi!

805
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,333
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

806
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,416
Don't move.

807
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,583
Checkmate, son of a bitch.
