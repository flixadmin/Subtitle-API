1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is oliver queen.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,970
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,500
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,440
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,870
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,310
To them, I am oliver queen.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,540
But to the rest
of starling city,

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,010
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,550
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,820
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,120
My name
is amanda waller,
mr. Queen.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,090
Welcome
to hong kong.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,230
Amanda waller
wants you working for her.
She will have her way.

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,000
You're felicity smoak.
I know a guy who might

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,230
Be interested
in hiring someone
with your expertise.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,000
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,570
Who?
Ray palmer.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,470
What are you
doing here?

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,110
No! No! Sara!

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,880
Sara!

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,850
No! No!

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,420
[sobbing]

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,360
Please!

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,630
Felicity,
all I'm trying to do

25
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,000
Is make things
easier on you.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,770
By having me
completely

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,340
Reconfigure
our phone system?

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,740
Do you even know
how difficult it is

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,740
To ping a clone
off a hacked
transband multiplex?

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,680
No, but only because
you weren't speaking
english just now.

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,950
Sara?

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,760
I didn't know
where else
to take her.

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,390
Felicity: Oh, my god.

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,590
Oh, my god! Oh.

35
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,290
What happened?

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,460
I couldn't...

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,330
I couldn't
leave her.

38
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,800
Felicity: We have to--
call--we can...

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,940
Take her
to the hospital!

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,680
Ollie. Ollie,
it's not fair!

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,920
We just got her
back, it's not fair!

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,100
Come here...

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,130
I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,370
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,210
I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,220
We'll take
our position here.

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,590
Who's your target?

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,030
I don't have a target--

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,830
You do.

50
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,760
Might have escaped
your notice,

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,370
But amanda waller
doesn't have a sense of humor.

52
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,030
Then why'd she drag
me off of lian yu

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,240
And bring me all
the way to hong kong

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,170
To become her hit man?
To become her operative.

55
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,810
Obviously she needs you
for something or she wouldn't
be threatening my family

56
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,780
To assure your compliance.
The target will be entering
our line any moment.

57
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,090
The target will walk 10 paces
through the roof garden

58
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,790
And arrive at his hotel suite.
That's your window.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,900
I see it.

60
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,030
Now.

61
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,110
Tommy?

62
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,020
You know, sara used
to have a stuffed animal.

63
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,660
It was this old,
worn out shark

64
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,890
That she got
from the starling aquarium.

65
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,060
Every time something awful
would happen to her,

66
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,660
I would always
find her holding
that stupid little shark

67
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,170
Close to her chest.

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,470
And now that my sister's dead,

69
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,710
Again the only thing
that I can think about

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,010
Is finding that dumb
stuffed animal

71
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,310
And putting it in her arms.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,850
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,520
You have nothing
to apologize for.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,620
Hey, whoever
did this,

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,490
I'm going
to find them.

76
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,360
We're going to.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,560
When I thought that sara
died on "the gambit,"

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
The only thing
that I could do

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
Was scream at the ocean.

80
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,730
I had so much anger and rage,

81
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,970
And I didn't know
what to do with it.

82
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,830
But I do now.

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
And I'm going
to help you catch

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,770
Whoever it is that did this.

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
You're already helping.

86
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,510
Laurel...

87
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,150
You told us
where to look.

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,450
I'm just supposed
to sit here and wait?

89
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,890
No. Now you take
care of yourself

90
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,560
And your family.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,520
Your father is
going to need you.

92
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,660
Telling him now,
it would kill him.

93
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,260
At least now if we wait until
we catch whoever did this,

94
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,730
It'll be easier on him.

95
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,440
Ok.

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,470
Where are you going?

97
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,970
I don't know.
I don't know
anything anymore.

98
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,910
But I know that
a bar is the last
place I should be.

Um...

105
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,530
I know you're still
traveling,

106
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,030
But I just,
I could really...

107
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,870
I'd really like
to hear your voice.

108
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,340
So please call me back.

109
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,310
What'd we get off
the cameras?

110
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,340
Place is
a drug haven.

111

They've all
either been
disabled

112

Or paint-balled
by local dealers.

113
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,210
Where are you going?

114
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,120
Where it
happened.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,150
[horns honking in distance]

116
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,500
Felicity told me.

[sighs]

118
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,010
You ok?

119
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,950
Killer stood there,

120
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,820
Loose gravel
on the rooftop.

121
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,950
Oliver...
Sara was here.

122
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,590
Scuff marks
back to the edge.

123
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,420
You don't have to do this
right now, man.

124
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,790
It's the only thing
that I can do.

125
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,720
Listen, I get it.
Military training.

126
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,260
Stay on task.
Your friend gets shot,
you just keep fighting.

127
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,630
But oliver...
I'm fine.

128
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,800
Well, I'm here
for you just the same.

129
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,470
Listen, sara was
my friend, too.

130
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,500
And if you think
you're going after
the person who did this solo,

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,410
You couldn't possibly
be more wrong.

132

[cell phone vibrating]

136
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,830
[voice disguised]
what is it, detective?

You ok? You look
like someone peed
in your cornflakes.

That kind of day, huh?

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,610
What's going on?

140
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,080
Another archer
in town.

Dropping bodies.

Seen this guy's
work before?
I might have.

You know where
scpd's finest
might find him?

Who's the victim?
John burke.

145
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,160
Some corporate
financier
from qurac.

146
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Seems like
he wandered into
the wrong part of town

147

Tonight looking
for a little local
"entertainment."

148

He ended up
with an arrow
to the chest.

Hey.

150

You watch your back,
all right? Whoever
this guy is...

He's a killer.

I never noticed before.

She was always so strong
and brave. [sniffs]

never be.

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,210
There's been a death
in the family.

165
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,880
You have any idea
what other archer
could have done this?

166
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,850
[exhales]
there aren't
that many of us.

167
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,350
Maybe 10 that I know of,

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,560
And most of them are in
the league of assassins.

169
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,090
Oliver,
you don't think...

170
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,090
No. No.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,300
They don't
target their own.

172
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,630
What'd you find out?
He hit again.

173
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,770
An abandoned warehouse
on the corner of
third and lemire.

174
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,340
Ninth floor. The victim
was a construction
foreman, tim kauffman.

175
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,940
Security cameras
can't get an angle.

176
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,970
Who's that?
Just some low level dealers

177
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,040
That set up shop
in abandoned warehouses.

178
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
Doesn't look like
much of an archer to me.

179
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,080
He might be a witness.
Diggle: Where do you want me?

180
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,180
Will lyla give you access
to a.R.G.U.S.'s database?

181
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,580
To find out who did
this, lyla will give us
access to a.R.G.U.S.

182
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,660
I need a list of everyone
on their radar--assassins
and mercenaries who use a bow.

183
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm on it.

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
What?

185
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,230
Uh, thea hasn't
called back yet.

186
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,480
You didn't
eliminate the target!

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,110
That's not a target,
that's my best friend!

188
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,650
Why am I pointing a gun
at my best friend?

189
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,680
Is this
some sort of test?

190
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
Yes. One you failed!

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,620
Good. Flunk me.

192
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,220
You think it's a coincidence
your friend just happened

193
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,390
To show up in hong kong?

194
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,920
He's here looking for you!
What?

195
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,030
When you logged into your email,
it set off an account alert.

Dead men don't check
their email, oliver.

197
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh, so this is
my fault?

198
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Waller needs you.
She can't let you
be compromised

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
By some rich kid flashing
your picture all over hong kong.

200
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,440
Whether you're the one
who pulls the trigger or not,

201
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
She wants tommy merlyn
off the board.

202
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,690
That is a cobalt
encrypted workstation.

203
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,690
You better not be
using it to tweet.

204
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,300
I was--I was,
um, actually just...

205
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,530
Accessing an fbi database?
What...

206
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,000
Roy, why are you
looking for thea?

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Because I don't
think she is where
she says she is.

208
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,470
Why would she lie?

209
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,950
Roy, oliver needs to see this.

210
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,320
No. This is my fault.
He's going to kill me.

211
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,290
What if she's in trouble?
What if she's not?

212
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,050
What if she just
needs space?

213
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,220
She's had five months

214
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,960
And thousands
of miles of space.

215
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,090
Oliver needs to see this.

[exhales]

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,900
You need to show it to him.

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,200
You have got to be kidding me.

What--where
are you going?

222
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,110
There's someone
I need to kill.

[elevator dings]

224
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,220
Did you do it to make a point?

225
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,320
Because I get it.
Loud and clear.

226
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,020
You are rich.
You are impulsive.

227
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,720
And frankly, you are
the creepiest form of stalker

228
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
That I have ever
had to deal with,

229
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,890
And believe me when
I'm telling you that
that is saying a lot,

230
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,760
And--what are you doing
to our old offices?

231
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,930
Hi. I'll be right back.

232
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,430
You like it? Yeah,
I'm just trying

233
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,570
To liven up
the place a bit.

234
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,140
I'm hosting
an event tonight.

235
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,500
A pledge drive of sorts.

236
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,640
Got to make
an impression, right?

237
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,410
Now, what can I do for you?

238
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,480
You can stop.
You can stop
sending me flowers,

239
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,010
And you can stop
texting me
and calling me

240
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,550
And emailing me,
because I spam
them, anyway.

241
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,780
Oh, is "spam" a verb now?

242
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,920
Because I am never,
ever, ever going
to work for you.

243
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,990
Actually, you already do.

244
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,520
Only because you
bought the store
that I work at!

245
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,120
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did!

246
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,800
My boss just called
and told me that you did.

247
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,930
Well, he's wrong--kind of.

248
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,070
I bought the holding company
which owns and operates

249
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,600
All 20,000 tech village stores.

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,040
But I guess either way,
yes, I am your boss now.

251
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
So you can either
work for me here

252
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,110
In a big office
with a big salary,

253
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,480
Or...You can work
for me there,

254

In that awful uniform.

255
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,850
Or...I can quit.

Which is what
I just did.

[scoffs] you know,

258
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,830
Most girls would be
flattered that I spent
$1.2 billion to hire them.

259
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,330
Even if I do have
a fairly genius plan
for revamping the stores.

260
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,960
In case you haven't noticed,
I am not most girls.

And I don't
need this. Or you.

off on a daily basis.

263

It's part of business,
and, well,

264
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,040
I own that. So I have
enough experience with
people being angry with me

265
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,080
To know when
they're really angry
at something else.

266
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,020
You right now are not
angry at me.

320
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,250
He's out canvassing.

321
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,820
Tell me about
the driver of the car.

322
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,620
His name is erlich
kelso. He just got out
of starling general--

323
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,290
And where are we
with lacroix?

324
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,490
He ditched
his burner.

325
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm searching the city
for any calls made to quebec.

326
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,290
We used that to track
him once; he's not going
to let it happen again.

327
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,630
All right, so why
don't we stop
searching for lacroix

328
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,960
And start searching
for his target?

329
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,170
Because there
must be a connection
with his victims.

330
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,670
Already on it.

331
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,710
I mean, what if we just--
we go to a local morgue

332
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,510
And we find a body
that looks like tommy's?

333
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,050
At the hong kong morgue?

334
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,880
You've got a better chance
of winning the lottery

335
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,750
And trying to pay waller off.

336
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,650
I am not going
to assassinate
my best friend,

337
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,620
Do you understand?
There has to be
another way.

338
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,290
There is.

339
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,390
But it involves
amanda waller

340
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,360
Finding someone else
to execute your friend.

341
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,170
No, not you, dad.
Look, I'm already
in hong kong.

342
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,600
No! No, I didn't tell you
I was taking the jet

343
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,310
Because I knew you would
freak out like this.

344
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,540
No, I don't know
how long, ok?
It doesn't matter.

345
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,780
Listen, if oliver
is still alive,
if he is still here--

346
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,620
Look, why don't you just
go back to banging
your pilates instructor, ok?

347
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,330
I'll just
be here searching
for my best friend.

348
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,100
[gasps]

349
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,770
I'm sorry, miss.
You can't go in there.

350
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,470
Laurel lance.
I'm with the district
attorney's office.

351
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,910
Erlich kelso
is a witness

352
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,210
Of my ongoing
investigation.

353
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,810
Mr. Kelso's under
protective custody.

354
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,780
Not from me.
And if you have
a problem with that,

355
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,750
You can call
your captain.

356
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,220
Tell him his
daughter says hello.

357
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,390
Who are you?

358
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,890
I work in the da's office.

359
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,960
I already
told the police,

360
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,360
I don't know
anything.

361
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,200
I still have to ask you
a few questions.

362
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,570
Why isn't
this working?
It is.

363
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,470
It's running an nsa
algorithm aggregating

364
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,110
The victims' personal
information using

365
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,480
Every government database
known, and unknown.

366
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,610
Well, it's taking too
long. Sara's killer
is still out there,

367
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,720
Which means that
every minute that
we waste down here--

368
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,080
I know! You don't
need to tell me

369
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,690
As if I don't already know.

370
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,590
You're right.

371
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,190
And I apologize.
I just need your a game
right now, felicity.

372
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
I don't have it!

373
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,370
My friend--our friend--

374
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,600
Was shot with arrows
and fell off of a rooftop.

375
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,200
Her body is upstairs
right above us in a freezer

376
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,640
Because we don't know
what to do with it--

377
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,940
With her.

378
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,740
So I am so sorry, oliver,

379
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,720
If I have feelings, but maybe
if you did, too, we...

380
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,150
Sorry.

381
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,520
That was mean.
But this is sara
we're talking about.

382
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,760
Your sara.

383
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,660
How can you stand there
being so cold

384
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,830
And rational?

385
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,330
'cause I don't
have the luxury
of falling to pieces.

386
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,500
Everyone's looking to me
to handle things,

387
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,170
To make the right
decisions.

388
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,270
Everyone
is looking to me...

389
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,440
To lead.

390
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,980
If I grieve,

391
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,680
Nobody else gets to.

392
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,690
You're still
a human being, oliver.

393
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,750
You're allowed to have feelings.

394
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,460
I know sometimes
that it's easier

395
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,060
To live under that hood.

396
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm not.

397
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,900
Earlier today,
I was looking at sara,

398
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,310
I realized something.

399
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,480
One of these days
it's going to be me.

400
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,150
And this...[sighs]

401
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,320
This life that
I've chosen...

402
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,620
It only ends one way.

403
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,460
So that's it?

404
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,060
You're just going
to spend your life

405
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,390
Hiding down here
in this cave,

406
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,600
Waiting to die?
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm not going
to wait with you,

408
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,170
Because if there's
one thing that
today has taught me,

409
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,000
Is that life is precious.

410
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,380
And I want so much more
in mine than this.

411
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,310
[sighs]

412
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,190
Let's start
with the obvious.

413
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,490
Why would someone
want to kill you?

414
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,230
I have no idea.

415
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,460
This whole thing,
it's insane.

416
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,800
Mr. Kelso, despite
what you may have heard,

417
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,230
Homicides at the hands
of a stranger

418
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,600
Are incredibly rare.

419
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,470
Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

420
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,970
Yeah, the guy
was a sicko.

421
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,740
And you're a liar.

422
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,580
I'm the victim here.
You're also a witness--

423
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,710
My witness. And you better
give me something useful,

424
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,180
Otherwise you're going to be
facing an obstruction charge.

425
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,550
You know, I think I want
to talk to your boss,

426
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,150
Because you can't
treat people like this.

427
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,460
Oh, really, you want
to talk to my boss?

428
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,360
Ohh!
How's your arm feeling?!

429
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,390
What are you doing?!

430
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,530
John burke and tim kaufman,

431
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,200
They were also shot by
with arrows.

432
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
And they're too dead
to tell me why.

433
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,400
Can't.

434
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,100
Ohh!
Burke and kaufman!

435
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,140
What do the two of them
have to do with you?

436
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,600
We were all
working on a deal!

437
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,040
But nobody
was supposed
to know about it.

438
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,010
Ohh! Ohh.

439
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,750
What kind of deal?

440
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,480
To build
an oil pipe line.

441
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,550
For amertek. It's--

442
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,580
Thea: You've reached thea.
Leave a message.

443
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,440
Hey, thea, it's me. Again.

444
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,350
And...I don't know
if you're getting
these messages,

445
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,480
But I would really
like to talk to you.

446
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,990
So please, just...

447
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,560
Call me back.

448
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,630
Bye.

449
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,600
Lyla has multiple
teams trying to get
an angle on lacroix.

450
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
[sighs]
where's felicity?

451
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
Hmm.

452
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,540
She needed some air.

453
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,840
And what do you
need, oliver?

454
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
I just need thea
to call me back.

455
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,950
That's not going
to happen.

456
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,760
Why? What do you mean?

457
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,610
It was during the siege.

458
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,110
We were going
to run away together,
but I couldn't leave

459
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,480
Without helping you fight.
And when I came back,
she was gone.

460
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,220
I didn't say anything
because this is my fault.

461
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,850
She knew I was lying
to her the entire time.

462
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,050
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything about
the letter.

463
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,160
I know that
I should have.

464
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,500
Ok.

465
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,610
Felicity, I really
need to talk to you,

466
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,980
So please, can you...
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

467
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,840
Laurel! Baby,
are you all right?

468
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,650
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.

469
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,680
Baby, a guy just
got skewered right
in front of you.

470
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,080
I hope
you're not fine.

471
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,120
And what the hell
were you doing here
in the first place?

472
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,220
The district attorney's office--

473
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,490
Did not send you.

474
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,890
You lied to my officers
and now what,

475
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,930
You're just going
to stand there

476
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,200
And you're going
to lie to me?

477
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,930
I needed to talk to him.
It was important.

478
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,430
Look, sweetie,
I know you want
to help,

479
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,970
But you don't
need to take
these kind of risks,

480
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,970
You understand?
Pretty sure
your sister's

481
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,840
Got that covered
for the both of you.

482
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,010
Yeah.

483
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,350
Go home.
We got this.

484
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,310
Ok?

485
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,220
[cell phone vibrates]

486
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,420
I've got something.
Meet me at verdant.

487
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,620
Amertek industries.

488
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,660
It's an oil company
based in starling city.

489
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,230
Ok. Now that
I've consolidated

490
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,430
All of lacroix's
victim's records,

491
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,230
I can run
the algorithm,
scan the data

492
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,800
And see who received
money from amertek.

493
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,000
How long does that take?
Not long.

494
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,200
Three to kelso,
one more to burke,
two more to kaufman.

495
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,670
All from a subsidiary
from amertek in qurac,

496
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,440
Which just happens to be
the largest untapped
oil field on the planet

497
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,380
Yeah. Looks like
amertek was trying
to strike an oil deal.

498
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,710
And some paid lacroix
to stop it.

499
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,280
None of this explains
how sara was involved.

500
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,620
Sara once told me
she worked in qurac.

501
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,580
And by "worked,"
I mean she killed
people for the league.

502
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,990
You're saying she might
have brought her work
home with her.

503
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,020
Who authorized the payments?

504
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,490
A board member of amertek
called tom westin.

505
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,360
He's lacroix's
next target.
What's his location?

506
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,300
You will not believe
where he's headed.

507
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,970
[sighs]

508
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,040
Where do you think
you're going?

509
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,710
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not.

510
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,640
Oliver, the only reason
why you know where
to find him is because--

511
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,780
You were reckless.
And lacroix almost
put an arrow in you.

512
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,820
Let me handle this.

513
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,850
Don't you dare tell me
to stay put and think
that I'll listen!

514
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,660
Sara was trained by some
of the greatest killers
in human history.

515
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,330
Lacroix put her down.

516
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,160
So what do you think
he's going to do to you?

517
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,730
I don't care about anything
except for getting him.

518
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,800
And I will.
You couldn't before!

519
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
I won't let him
escape again.

520
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,870
I promise.

521

[indistinct chatter]

522
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,700
Thank you.

Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

524
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,400
Given all that has
befallen this city,

525
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,870
It's easy for us to lose hope--

526
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,270
To hide in our castles
and be thankful that our
ledges are in the black.

527
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,410
Well, we, the city's
most affluent
businessmen and women

528
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,610
Hold its future in our hands.

529
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,150
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

530
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,590
I will give away
half of my net worth

531
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,650
To the benefit of our home.

532
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,890
And this will be my salary
for the year.

533
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,230
So tonight, I invite you all
to join me in this investment.

534
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,900
Not just with your money,
but with your ingenuity,

535
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,100
And most importantly,
your time.

536
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,340
The city is my home,
but it's yours, too.

537
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,910
So help make star city
our future.

Let go of the arrow.

I thought
you'd be taller.

542

It's over.

543
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,630
Lower your bow and live.

544
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,300
We both know
that's not
going to happen.

545
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,880
Who hired you?!
Who's she?

546
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,350
You don't want
to do this.

547
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,750
Yes, I do!

548
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,780
Killing him
won't bring her back.

549
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,750
I know it won't bring
her back, she's dead!

550
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,590
I have stood where
you are right now;

551

Where you're so consumed
with rage you can

552
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,360
Hardly breathe,
and you think that

553
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,090
Taking revenge
will make it better,

554
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
But laurel...It won't.

555
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,030
It only makes it worse.

No, he murdered sara!

I wouldn't deny it.

Even with a gun in your face?

and listen to him.

No.

No, he killed my sister.

wouldn't want--

Don't you dare tell me

That this isn't what
sara would have wanted!

Don't you tell me
to think of her,

thinking of her!
