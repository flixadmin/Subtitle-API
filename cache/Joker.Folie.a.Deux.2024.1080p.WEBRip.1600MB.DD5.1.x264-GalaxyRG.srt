Nothing good about it.

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:36,743
Get up!

28
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,490
Let's go, get up.

29
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,884
Let's go boys.
Let's get this show on the road.

30
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:49,190
Come on! Come on!

31
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,670
Come on, get out of bed.

32
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:51,671
Let's go, get up.

33
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,500
Clean this fucking mess up.

34
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:56,980
Hey, Jackie, I need a hand.

35
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:00,245
Put some clothes on.

36
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,855
Diaz, what the fuck?

37
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,127
You got a joke for me today?

38
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,781
Move!

39
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,481
All right, come on,
let's go, guys.

40
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,918
Move your fucking ass. Move.

41
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,662
Don't test me, Walters.

42
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,273
Come on, boys.

43
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,449
Get him on the ground.

44
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,494
Move your fucking ass, Bullock.

45
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:33,582
Fuck you!

46
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,324
Get the fuck out my cell.

47
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,893
Leave me alone.

48
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,895
Hey, Arthur, you feelin'
crazy today or what?

49
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:44,724
I don't wanna come out today.

50
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,247
Take him down to F Ward.

51
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,988
I don't wanna come out today.

52
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,382
You got a big day today.
You better put on a happy face.

53
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,861
Get the fuck off me.

54
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,882
Let's not do this again, Beanie.

55
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,932
Shut up!

56
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,549
Let's go, Arthur.

57
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,377
Come on, Fleck.

58
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,727
Don't need your fancy lawyer
blaming me if you're late.

59
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,251
She knows how much you like me, right?

60
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,820
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

61
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,476
Yeah,
it's been a while, hasn't it?

62
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:11,941
Move.

63
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,000
Right on the line.

64
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,437
Let's go!

65
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:31,265
Back the fuck up, Ken.

66
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,223
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go on, front of the line.

67
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:36,923
Fleck. Fleck's next, my dear.

68
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,795
Hey, stay in line.

69
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:40,840
Yeah, you heard him.

70
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,974
Hey, hey, hey, back up.

71
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:48,761
Freak bit me!

72
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:54,157
Go.

73
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,603
All that kid's done
since he got here
is fucking smile.

74
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:07,214
And today, all of a sudden,
he bites Moran?

75
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,129
It's because nobody likes Moran.

76
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,087
He was at Gotham State
for, like, eight years

77
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:13,481
before he got here,
and he's still a fucking temp.

78
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,665
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

79
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,537
I already asked him.

80
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,929
I got a joke for ya.

81
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,066
This guy's dog dies, right?
And he really loved this dog.

82
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:38,245
So, he goes down to the church,
and he asks Father Mulcahy

83
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,987
if he'd perform
a funeral for him. Right?

84
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,556
And Mulcahy says, "Oh, no.
I'm sorry my son,

85
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,820
we can't have a service
for an animal in our church.

86
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,691
Uh, but, I bet if you go down

87
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,911
- to the veterinarian in town..."
- Fuck.

88
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:53,347
"...he can do it
for you. You see?"

89
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,262
Goddamn it, Arthur.

90
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,569
Uh, so the guy says,
"Oh, thanks very much, Father."

91
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,397
And he says,
"Do you think two grand

92
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:02,399
would be enough
to cover the service?"

93
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,707
Father Mulcahy looks at him...

94
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,668
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was Catholic?"

95
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,500
Eh?

96
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:16,544
Clean yourself up.

97
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:17,850
You like that one, Arthur?

98
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,941
Let's go.

99
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,856
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was a Catholic?"

100
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,697
Look around, Arthur.

101
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:24,786
This is how
the other half lives.

102
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,353
Could have been all yours

103
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,223
if you hadn't killed
five people.

104
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,226

111
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:08,047
Come on. You fucking lunatic.

112
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:16,272
Jesus Christ, you couldn't
get him a fucking umbrella?

113
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,405
Aw, come on, counselor,

114
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,233
you know we can't
give these boys umbrellas.

115
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,887
It's for their own good.

116
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,758
Oh, don't give me your shit.
He's soaking wet.

117
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,673
Well, those are the rules,
counselor,

118
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,023
but I'll break them
if you ask me.

119
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:29,285
I bet you would.

120
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,852
Mm-hm.

121
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,549
Oh, you're welcome, by the way,

122
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:33,899
for getting him
all cleaned up for you.

123
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,163
Sit down.

124
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:40,209
Here, Arthur.

125
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:46,738
Today,
we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

126
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,913
Remember her?

127
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,177
She's gonna be
videotaping you this time,

128
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,310
so we can show it at your
competency hearing next week.

129
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,835
And if they find you competent,

130
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,880
and they will, they always do,

131
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,882
then we're going to trial.

132
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:07,149
You need to be in an actual
hospital with actual doctors.

133
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,500
Not this
Department of Corrections...

134
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,677
bullshit with these thugs.

135
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,638
Dr. Beatty thinks
that with everything

136
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,945
that happened to you
in your childhood,

137
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,164
it caused a split...

138
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,169
this fragmentation in you...

139
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,171
...to help you cope
with your pain.

140
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:34,568
She believes you have another
person living inside of you.

141
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:39,573
And it was this other person
who committed those crimes.

142
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,969
Do you understand
what that means, Arthur?

143
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,366
<i>I'll be asking you
a few questions today, Arthur,
okay?</i>

144
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:57,199
<i>Maybe you don't remember
some things?</i>

145
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,072
<i>Or you're confused
about what you did?</i>

146
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,988
<i>I'm here to help you
try and sort out what happened.</i>

147
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,348
Arthur, I'm not here
only to help with your defense.

148
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,090
I'm here for you.

149
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,484
<i>But for me to do my job,</i>

150
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,271
<i>I need you to be
candid with me.</i>

151
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,663
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

152
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:30,798
<i>Can I have a cigarette?</i>

153
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,495
<i>Of course you can.</i>

154
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:40,547
<i>Let's start
with the first incident, okay?</i>

155
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:46,988
<i>The three men who accosted you
on the subway, who bullied you,</i>

156
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:49,425
<i>did it feel like they
triggered something painful?</i>

157
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,166
<i>From your past? Your childhood?</i>

158
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,561
Do you remember
any of what happened?

159
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,437
Did you... black out?

160
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,091
See bright lights?

161
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:05,877
Mm...

162
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,143
Okay.

163
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:16,713
How about Murray Franklin?

164
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,935
What, if anything, do you
remember about that night?

165
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:29,683
<i>The music.</i>

166
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,949
<i>That's good.
Arthur, that is good.</i>

167
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,693
Can I tell you what I remember
about that night?

168
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:45,351
I remember you came out
dressed as Joker.

169
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:50,922
And I remember Joker
was dancing to that music.

170
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,793
<i>Right?</i>

171
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,189
<i>I really liked his band.</i>

172
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:03,543
<i>My mom and I u-- used
to watch the show together.</i>

173
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,067
<i>She liked
Murray Franklin as well?</i>

174
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,680
<i>"He's so handsome.</i>

175
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,639
<i>Look at those
sparkling white teeth."</i>

176
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,426
Is that your mother's voice?

177
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,515
Mm.

178
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,821
Do you often hear her voice
in your head?

179
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,390
All the time.

180
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,830
Did it change
at all after she died?

181
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,267
What does that mean?

182
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,921
Did you...

183
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,664
this other part of you...

184
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,580
Joker...

185
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,757
Did it come out more
after she died?

186
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,499
You lived together, right?
In a one-bedroom apartment?

187
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,594
Maybe I could talk to Joker
about it.

188
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,945
Would he like to talk to me?

189
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:27,932
Hey, Arthur.

190
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:29,977
Arthur.

191
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,153
I mean,
he'll do anything. Anything.

192
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,155
The guards said you wanted
to show me how to kiss.

193
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,552
But they said Joker's
a really good kisser.

194
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,250
Nobody's ever gave me
a kiss before.

195
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,690
Twenty bucks
says he chokes him.

196
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:57,439
There you go.

197
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:00,268
Ricky don't know what hit him.

198
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:01,966
There was no hesitation.

199
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,445
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:04,446
Kinda like...

201
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:08,798
I gotta be honest with you,
Arthur.

202
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:12,193
I wouldn't have took you
for a hopeless romantic.

203
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,586
Can I have a cigarette?

204
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,371
Why not.

205
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:18,025
Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

206
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,027
He doesn't get a cigarette
unless he tells a joke.

207
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,073
No, come on. He still
makes us laugh, doesn't he?

208
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,075
Barely.

209
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,119
Hey.

210
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,253
Remember that music class
we saw?

211
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,951
The other day? B Ward?

212
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,084
Remember, with all the singing?

213
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,043
I got you in.
We're going next week.

214
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,263
Bullshit.

215
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:40,917
- The fuck you do that for?
- Eh, eh. No, no.

216
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,963
Went and saw Kellerman,
I said...

217
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,052
you've been good.
You deserve it.

218
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:47,707
The hell is he thinking?

219
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,578
Yeah.

220
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:52,016
He knows he can get
some good press for it.

221
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,235
Plus, I told him
I'd go along with him.

222
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,628
Oh, ho, there it is.

223
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:57,717
That explains it.

224
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,806
Count! Let's go.

225
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,199
Line up by two.

226
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,505
Ricky. Come on, Romeo,
line 'em up.

227
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,204
Let's go. Twos.
Line up by twos.

228
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:07,161
Come on, let's go.

229
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,250
Are you being serious?

230
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:10,512
I am being serious.

231
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,384
On the Bible.

232
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:14,995
Wasn't that hard, either.

233
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,130
Ever since they made
that TV movie about you,

234
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,349
everybody still thinks
you're a star.

235
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,961
How about you, Arthur?

236
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,529
Do you still think
you're a star?

237
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,707
I bet you do, don't you?

245
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:29,173
Let's go, boys, it's showtime.

246
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,783
Wakey-wakey!

00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,785

Hey, come on. Let's go.

00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,876

250
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,269

00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,315

Group, I want you to welcome
Arthur Fleck.

262
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:24,402
Now, I know it's odd to have
an inmate from E Ward in here,

263
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:27,535
but I have been assured
he's been a model patient

264
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,276
without any incidents.

265
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,716
I know this might feel strange,
Mr. Fleck, a new environment.

266
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,546
You see, we use music
in this class to make us whole,

267
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,070
to balance
the conflicting forces, the...

268
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,423
...the fractures
within ourselves.

269
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:48,643
All I ask is that you sing,

270
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,255
if and when
you're ready to sing.

271
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,084
Okay, let's go.

272

276
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,620
No, no, no, I can't really.
Look, I don't know it.

277
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:10,709
Okay. Um...

278
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:11,797
Oh, this one.

279
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,407
Is it really you?

280
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,409
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Great.

281
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,671

289
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,519

So, what's a nice guy like you
doing in a place like this?

293
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:49,182
I killed five people.

294
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,358
One live on national television.

295
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,534
What about you?

296
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,930
I set fire to my parents'
apartment building.

297
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,065
Actually...

298
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:05,851
...it was six.

299
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:09,158
Nobody knows,
but also I killed my mother.

300
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,946
I should have done that.

301
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:16,644
My mother had me committed.

302
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,559
She says I'm psychotic.

303
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,347
You know, I must've watched
that TV movie

304
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:25,218
they made about you,
like, 20 times.

305
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,916
Yeah. Was it good?

306
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,876
They won't let me watch it.

307
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,094
It was good.

308
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,923
It was really good.

309
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,535
I grew up
in the same neighborhood.

310
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,363
Me and my friends
used to take that staircase

311
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,365
to school every day.

312
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,324
My parents didn't
give a fuck about me either.

313
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:46,326
My father beat the shit
out of me.

314
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:51,375
Well, guess what?

315
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,159
"Knock, knock."

316
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,553
"Sorry, kid, your dad
was killed in a car accident."

317
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,995
Sorry. That's not funny.

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,611
If only those friends
could see me now.

319
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:16,487
When I first saw Joker,

320
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,228
when I saw you
on <i>Murray Franklin,</i>

321
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:22,449
the whole time I was watching,
I kept thinking,

322
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,279
"I hope this guy

Yeah.

Come here.

00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:15,385
What?

527
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:17,822
Come on. Can you get up?

528
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,739
Come into the light.

529
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,532
They're sending me home.

530
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,101
What? Why?

531
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:38,973
They're saying you're
a bad influence on me.

532
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:42,368
What?

533
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,068
This is gonna be good for us.

534
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,722
Now, I can be at your trial
every day.

535
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:50,724
I can see you every day
until you get out.

536
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:54,641
And then what?

537
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,950
We're gonna build a mountain.

538
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:04,695
Wait, wait.

539
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,187
You brought make-up.

540
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,321
I want to see the real you.

541
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,348
Look what they did to you.

542
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,478
It's just us now.

543
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,969
You need to stop
taking your medication.

544
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,797
I already have.

545
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,383
Can you do it?

546
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,776
Yeah.

547
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,469
What's he gonna ask me about?

548
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,993
Besides... you know.

549
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,171
Well, hopefully,
about your life in here,

550
00:41:57,824 --> 00:42:00,392
and what the conditions
are really like in this place.

551
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:04,396
He might ask you about Lee.

552
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,530
She's been out there giving
a lot of interviews about you.

553
00:42:07,704 --> 00:42:08,748
And about herself.

554
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:10,707
Good.

555
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:13,318
You know, I love her.

556
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,408
She gets me.

557
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,237
Two minutes. Paddy's ready.

558
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:21,456
Arthur.

559
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:25,330
This is a chance for you to show
a different side of yourself.

560
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,943
So the public can see
who you really are.

561
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,336
And I don't think
you should smoke.

562
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,643
I think it makes you
look cavalier.

563
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,644
Okay.

564
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,820
We need to use this time

565
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:39,736
to show people
that you're human.

566
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:44,001
They need to understand
you were sick. Delusional.

567
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:45,524
Mm-hm.

568
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:49,397
You're not Joker.
You're Arthur Fleck.

569
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:50,790
Hm?

570
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,141
Don't worry.
You're gonna be great.

571
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:58,624
Arthur.

572
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:05,805
Are you okay? It's--

573
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:09,156
It's not too late to cancel.

574
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:19,166
So, uh... you want me
to call you Arthur or The Joker?

575
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,168
Mr. Meyers,
you know we have an agreement.

576
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:22,996
You can't call him "Joker."

577
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,390
It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

578
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:28,959
When you're ready, Paddy.

579
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,526
She has to leave now.

580
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:33,267
You can watch
from behind the glass,

581
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:34,355
but you can't be in here.

582
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:36,836
Just be yourself.

583
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:48,413
- We rolling?
- Rolling.

584
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,504
<i>Cameras up.</i>

585
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,334
<i>Two years ago,
the name Arthur Fleck</i>

586
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,728
<i>hit Gotham like a hurricane.</i>

587
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,904
An unassuming part-time
party clown

588
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:03,080
and struggling stand-up comic,

589
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:05,952
Fleck committed
five horrific murders

590
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,172
in the span of just four weeks.

591
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,002
And now, with hundreds
already lining up to get a seat

592
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:15,353

ever broadcast live on TV,

<i>Arthur Fleck, The Joker,</i>

594

<i>is sitting down

595
00:44:20,663 --> 00:44:23,491
<i>since that infamous night

596
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,930
<i>And yes, we all know
how that turned out.</i>

597
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:32,762
Arthur Fleck, welcome.

598
00:44:33,414 --> 00:44:34,677
Hello.

599
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:39,377
Take me back to that night
onstage with Murray Franklin.

600
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,163
What was going
through your mind...

601
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:45,688
when you pulled out that gun
and blew his brains out?

602
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:52,433
Well, Paddy, um...

603
00:44:56,002 --> 00:44:59,005
I was going through a lot
back then. Um...

604
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:03,096
I don't really remember much
from that night. I, uh...

605
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,012
blacked out,
I saw bright lights.

606
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,580
<i>I was having a hard time</i>

607
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:11,061
<i>knowing the difference
between what was real or not.</i>

608
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:12,279
<i>Oh, please.</i>

609
00:45:12,453 --> 00:45:14,629
You did it on live TV, pal.

610
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:16,066
Doesn't get any more real
than that.

611
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,286
Paddy, all I remember
from that night

612
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,462
is I was gonna kill myself.

613
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,160
On television.

614
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:26,859
I thought Murray
was playing a part in my show.

615
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:29,601
But he was a bad actor.

616
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:31,995
So he got what he deserved.

617
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:34,867
Your last joke,
if we can call it a joke,

618
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,651
"You get
what you bleeping deserve."

619
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:37,957
That's what you said.

620
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:40,568
That's not fun,
that's not funny.

621
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:43,702
You're right, I...
I should have told a better one.

622
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,923
You're trying to be funny now?

623
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,446
No.

624
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,886
Do you deserve to die?

625
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,062
The DA is calling
for the death penalty.

626
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:58,412
You just said that you wanted
to kill yourself on TV.

627
00:45:58,586 --> 00:45:59,544
So, tell us...

628
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:02,765
...you still wanna die?

629
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:07,465
Well, at the time, it certainly
seemed a lot easier than living.

630
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:11,295
Um, but that's...
that's not me anymore.

631
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:12,470
That's not...

632
00:46:13,819 --> 00:46:14,733
That's not who I am.

633
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:16,126
That wasn't really you.

634
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,170
No, that's not right.

635
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:18,824
Let me get this straight.

636
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:20,695
- That's not what I meant.
- So your defense is,

637
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,654
"It was The Joker who did it."

638
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:24,438
- An insanity defense.
- Okay, I don't--

639
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:25,831
I don't know about a defense.

640
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:28,268
That this alternate personality,

641
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:31,619
this killer clown in you
killed Murray.

642
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:34,492
Who am I speaking to now?
Which one of you is here?

643
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,582
The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?

644
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,889
Or The Joker, who goaded
a bunch of no-good punks--

645
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,716
Do you really care?

646
00:46:42,543 --> 00:46:43,718
You don't.

647
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,417
You're just like Murray.

648
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:48,941
You're just like everyone.
You want sensationalism.

649
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:50,421
You don't care about...

650
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:52,466
You just wanna talk
about my mistakes.

651
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,946
You wanna talk about the things
that I did in the past.

652
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,382
Not about who I am now.

653
00:46:55,556 --> 00:46:57,645
Not how I'm different now.

654
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,433
That's what we should be
talking about, Paddy.

655
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:05,610
Okay, okay.

656
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,656
- We should take a break.
- We're not taking a break.

657
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:09,875
<i>All right.</i>

658
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,795
Okay, so, tell us...
what's changed, Arthur?

659
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,494
Well, I'll tell you
what's changed, Paddy.

660
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:23,758
I'm not alone anymore.

661
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,631
Right.

662
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:30,287
The girl who was singing.
The night you tried to escape.

663
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:32,463
We weren't trying to escape.

664
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:33,812
Miss Harley Quinzel.

665
00:47:36,249 --> 00:47:38,338
You two put on
quite a performance that night.

666
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:39,644
Aww...

667
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:43,866
She's really something,
isn't she?

668
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,216
You tell me.

669
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,566
I mean,
don't you think it's all...

670
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:52,613
...don't you think
it's a little too much?

671

Everything okay?

Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm just looking for someone.

Please, Mr. Fleck, sit down.

It's my view that there is
absolutely no evidence

774
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:54,372
that Arthur Fleck suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

775
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:58,985
Or that he ever behaved
in the role of "Joker,"

776
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:04,077
as a separate personality
dissociated from himself.

777
00:57:04,817 --> 00:57:06,819
Doctor, in your opinion,

778
00:57:06,993 --> 00:57:09,605
concerning the work
you did on this case,

779
00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:14,740
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers
from a mental disease or defect?

780
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:17,482
No. In my opinion,

781
00:57:17,656 --> 00:57:22,487
he's not psychotic
or unable to test reality.

782
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:25,577
I think he was sane
when he committed these crimes.

783
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:29,973
In fact, I believe he fakes
his mental illness.

784
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,193
Quiet.

785
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,938
And... if he's, uh...

786
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:42,507
...faking it, as you say,

787
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:45,031
then what is your opinion

788
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:48,513
on the defendant's
mental condition?

789
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:51,168
I believe he has
four relatively minor

790
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,040
and quite common
mental disorders

791
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:57,783
that involve
long-standing sadness,

792
00:57:57,957 --> 00:58:02,048
narcissistic self-centeredness,
friendlessness,

793
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:04,790
an indifference
to the feelings of others.

794
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:07,445
This is
a very disturbed individual.

795
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,581
But I can't give you any kind
of psychiatric defense for him.

796
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:14,626
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

797
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:17,499
Nothing further, Your Honor.

798
00:58:19,588 --> 00:58:21,111
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

799
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,547
Thank you.

800
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:27,857
Doctor Liu, good morning.

801
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,032
Morning.

802
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:32,514
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

803
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:34,080
About two hours.

804
00:58:34,254 --> 00:58:35,647
About two hours.

805
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:38,607
It was actually 89 minutes.

806
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,828
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

807
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:45,222
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

808
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:49,182
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

809
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:51,707
that this "Joker"

810
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,928
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

811
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:58,409
That that's not who he is.

812
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,847
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

813
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:06,678
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

814
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:09,812
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

815
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:12,554
Did you read the records

816
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:14,817
from the
Department of Social Services...

817
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:19,822
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

818
00:59:19,996 --> 00:59:21,998
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

819
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,263
His mother's home.

820
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,439
I did, yes.

821
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:32,530
And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

822
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:36,142
did you ask him
why Social Services

823
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:38,710
didn't believe
the horrific stories

824
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:41,757
a seven-year-old boy told them

825
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:44,586
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

826
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,115
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

827
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,943
Hmm.

828
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:56,902
So you want us to believe,

829
00:59:57,947 --> 01:00:03,126
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

830
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,391
and reading through
his records and tests

831
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:10,960
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

832
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:12,788
you want us to believe

833
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:16,356
that you can say
with absolute certainty

834
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:21,013
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

835
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:25,191
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

836
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:27,846
and create another identity

837
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:33,983
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

838
01:00:34,157 --> 01:00:37,116
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

839
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:41,730
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

840
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:44,863
when he was
attacked and tormented

841
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:48,301
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

842
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:54,525
<i>"After I woke up this morning,</i>

843
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:57,876
<i>I thought,
'Murray, Murray, Murray.'</i>

844
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,618
And then there's Murray.

845
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,054
Funny, right?

846
01:01:03,012 --> 01:01:04,753
Then I remember Sophie.

847
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,277
- I had anoth--"
- Objection. Your Honor...

848
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:10,193
Again, my client's
personal diary is privileged.

849
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,890
Overruled.

850
01:01:12,064 --> 01:01:14,763
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

851
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,329
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

852
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:17,940
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

853
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:19,245
They weren't meant
to be read out loud.

854
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:20,725
Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

855
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,164
These are your words
she's reading.

856
01:01:25,338 --> 01:01:26,557
And it's up to the jury

857
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:28,167
to determine
what to make of them.

858
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:32,084
Please proceed.

859
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:35,609
Ms. Kane,
please continue reading

860
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:38,308
from the, uh...
the highlighted portion.

861
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:41,441
"Then I remember Sophie.

862
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:44,270
Had another dream about her.
Forgot it.

863
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,578
<i>I almost never dream.</i>

864
01:01:47,752 --> 01:01:50,102
What do I gotta do to remember?"

865
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,583
That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

866
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,803
whom he was obsessed with.

867
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:55,717
What was that date?

868
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:58,284
November 17.

869
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,723
Let the record show,

870
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,856
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

871
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,729
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

872
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:14,692
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

873
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,741
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

874
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,177
but you have read all of

875
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,092
Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?

876
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:24,484
Yes, I have.

877
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,313
And in your opinion,

878
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:30,882
does this sound
like a different voice?

879
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,322
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

880
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:39,586
No, it sounds like Arthur.

881
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,154
Go on.

882
01:02:42,328 --> 01:02:45,244
He often wrote about
his fantasies.

883
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:52,164
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

884
01:02:53,557 --> 01:02:56,560
<i>And of course, his jokes.</i>

885
01:02:56,734 --> 01:03:00,825
<i>There were always
a lot of... these...</i>

886
01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:03,132
<i>these unfunny jokes.</i>

887
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:06,700
She's just a social worker.

888
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,702
I don't think
she's even qualified--

889
01:03:08,877 --> 01:03:10,443
You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

890
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:14,317
He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

891
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,885
Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

892
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,278
Let's not do this here. Please?

893
01:03:19,452 --> 01:03:21,150
Do you see
all those people out front?

894
01:03:21,324 --> 01:03:22,847
Who do you think
they're here for?

895
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:24,849
How many T-shirts
is Arthur Fleck on?

896
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:27,634
How many signs?

897
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:29,201
It's the Trial of the Century

898
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,638
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

899
01:03:31,813 --> 01:03:34,119
- What do you mean by that?
- Can't you see how sick he is?

900
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:36,121
How much help he needs?

901
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:38,341
He's not sick.

902
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:41,431
He's perfect.

903
01:03:41,605 --> 01:03:42,867
You don't really think
he's just gonna

904
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,913
walk out of here, do you?

905
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,002
Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

906
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,918
- With me by his side.
- And then what?

907
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,182
Any further statements?

908
01:03:53,356 --> 01:03:55,184
And then we're gonna
build a mountain.

909
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:57,664
- A what?
- From a little hill.

910
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,406
What does that even mean?

911
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,886
- Are you going to get married?
- Move!

912
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,847
You're not listening.

913
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:08,066
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

914
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,503
No, you're not listening.

915
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:12,201
Lee's looking out for me.

916
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:16,509
She understands
what I've been through.

917
01:04:16,683 --> 01:04:18,294
What are you talking about?

918
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,166
We're from
the same neighborhood.

919
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:25,388
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

920
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:26,911
She had her committed.

921
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:29,479
So just give her a break.

922
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:33,309
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

923
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,963
I know.

924
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:37,574
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

925
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,707
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

926
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:43,928
Her father is not dead,
he's a doctor.

927
01:04:44,668 --> 01:04:46,278
She voluntarily
committed herself

928
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:47,671
to the hospital,

929
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:49,325
and then just
checked herself out

930
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:50,543
when she wanted to.

931
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:52,328
She didn't check herself out.

932
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,156
Arthur.

933
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,723
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

934
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:02,512
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

935
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:05,689
You wouldn't get it.

936
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:10,128
My point is she's playing you
for a fool.

937
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:13,218
I'm sorry, I just--

938
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,179
I know what it's like
to love somebody.

939
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:19,790
But I don't think you can
believe a word she says.

962
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,411
What happened?

963
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,806
Well, you weren't even looking
at me anymore.

964
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,242
You were making it
all about yourself.

965
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,766
And the song...

966
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,160
is about loving me!

967
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,338
Now look who's making it
all about themselves.

968
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:14,905
Oh...

969
01:07:15,384 --> 01:07:17,081
So you're saying
it's not about us?

970
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,650
It is, but we're singing
for them.

971
01:07:20,824 --> 01:07:22,826
That's why we're here, honey.

972
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,134
Oh! 'Cause I got
this sneaking suspicion

973
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,658
that we're not giving the people
what they want.

974
01:07:28,832 --> 01:07:30,964
It's okay baby, you're right.

975
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,577
Let's give the people
what they want.

976
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:39,016
Music.
Let's take it from the top.

977
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,069
Is the honeymoon over?

978
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,078
What?

979
01:08:00,603 --> 01:08:01,952
Why'd you-- Why'd you do that?

980
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:12,658
Pew!

981
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:14,921
Pew!

982
01:08:16,488 --> 01:08:17,924
- Get Healey.
- Pew!

983
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:22,015
Ba-room!

984
01:08:27,325 --> 01:08:29,632
Well, look at you.

985
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:33,157
Couple of weeks back on TV
and already acting
like you own the joint.

986
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:35,594
What the fuck are you two doing
sitting on our bleachers?

987
01:08:35,768 --> 01:08:37,509
Who said they're your bleachers?

988
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:40,121
Ricky, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

989
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,819
You heard me. Up.

990
01:08:43,472 --> 01:08:45,126
Guess who I just saw out front?

991
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,216
Your little lady friend.

992
01:08:49,913 --> 01:08:51,828
All right, enough.
Get up, both of you.

993
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,135
Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.

994
01:08:57,573 --> 01:08:59,227
See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?

995
01:09:01,272 --> 01:09:02,317
Move it!

996
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:06,799
Every day, this asshole.

997
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,722
You're a real
fucking whack job, Fleck.

998
01:09:19,247 --> 01:09:20,596
Uh-uh!

999
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:36,046
Hey.

1000
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,265
Five minutes.

1001
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:43,619
How are you holding up?

1002
01:09:55,544 --> 01:09:57,241
Is everything okay?

1003
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,207
Did you-- Did you lie to me?

1004
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:11,777
Sure.

1005
01:10:12,517 --> 01:10:14,302
I mean, everybody lies a little.

1006
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:21,439
And you're not from
the same neighborhood as me?

1007
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:23,702
And your...
your dad's a doctor?

1008
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:25,965
You're rich?

1009
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:30,013
I just wanted you to like me.

1010
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:38,543
Did you really
check yourself in here?

1011
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,459
Yeah.

1012
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,465
That's crazy.

1013
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:53,558
Just... because you wanted
to meet me?

1014
01:10:54,385 --> 01:10:55,821
Just to meet you.

1015
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:02,611
You could have just
wrote me a letter.

1016
01:11:04,265 --> 01:11:07,311
And said what? I'm nobody.

1017
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,358
I haven't done anything
with my life like you have.

1018
01:11:14,275 --> 01:11:15,754
Did you really watch
that TV movie

1019
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:17,887
they made about me 20 times?

1020
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:20,759
Um... probably more like
four or five.

1021
01:11:26,025 --> 01:11:27,984
Was it actually good,
or did you lie about that too?

1022
01:11:28,376 --> 01:11:29,855
It was great.

1023
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:41,693
My lawyer... says you're
playing me for a fool.

1024
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,653
I'm no fool.

1025
01:11:46,394 --> 01:11:48,526
Can't you see what she's doing?

1026
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,833
They're laughing at you
in there.

1027
01:11:53,618 --> 01:11:55,577
She doesn't care about you.

1028
01:11:57,622 --> 01:11:58,841
I do.

1029
01:12:01,322 --> 01:12:03,628
Do you know I moved
into your old apartment building

1030
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:06,501
to make us a home
for when you get out?

1031
01:12:06,675 --> 01:12:08,807
Did your lawyer tell you that?

1032
01:12:09,547 --> 01:12:12,158
You did?

1033
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,117
I don't want to live there.

1034
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:20,123
I'm pregnant.

1035
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:26,651

Did you think
he was gonna hurt you?

1063
01:15:02,154 --> 01:15:02,938
Or your daughter?

1064
01:15:04,026 --> 01:15:05,506
I did, yes.

1065
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:09,945
You believed he was dangerous.

1066
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:13,949
Well,
he broke into my apartment.

1067
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,082
You call the police?

1068
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:19,520
No.

1069
01:15:21,478 --> 01:15:24,133
His mother told me, uh...

1070
01:15:24,307 --> 01:15:26,788
that he'd had problems
his whole life, but that he...

1071
01:15:26,962 --> 01:15:28,616
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1072
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:32,750
And...

1073
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:38,582
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

1074
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:44,370
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

1075
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,548
I didn't really know him.

1076
01:15:48,374 --> 01:15:51,900
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

1077
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:55,033
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

1078
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:57,470
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

1079
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:00,343
And Ms. Dumond,

1080
01:16:00,778 --> 01:16:03,825
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1081
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:08,177
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1082
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:12,094
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1083
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,532
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1084
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,361
And then I was a character

1085
01:16:18,535 --> 01:16:21,494
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1086
01:16:22,321 --> 01:16:23,018
- It was awful?
- Then all these people...

1087
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:24,672
No.

1088
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,196
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1089
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:31,504
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1090
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:33,681
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1091
01:16:35,987 --> 01:16:38,381
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1092
01:16:38,555 --> 01:16:39,948
We moved out of the city.

1093
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,821
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1094
01:16:43,995 --> 01:16:45,736
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1095
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:50,001
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1096
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:54,049
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

1097
01:16:55,964 --> 01:16:58,401
Thank you. No more questions.

1098
01:16:59,968 --> 01:17:01,709
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

1099
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,495
Ms. Dumond.

1100
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:09,934
What happened
after you asked Arthur

1101
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:12,328
to leave your apartment
that night?

1102
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:16,332
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1103
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,900
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

1104
01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:20,553
you or your daughter?

1105
01:17:22,294 --> 01:17:23,600
No.

1106
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,560
And did you watch him on TV
on <i>Murray Franklin</i>
the following week?

1107
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:29,519
I did.

1108
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:32,304
And did that seem
like the same man

1109
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:34,567
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1110
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,963
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1111
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:42,053
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1112
01:17:43,968 --> 01:17:46,362
And while Arthur's mother

1113
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,626
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1114
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,715
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1115
01:17:56,067 --> 01:17:57,460
Um...

1116
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:01,812
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1117
01:18:01,986 --> 01:18:04,380
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1118
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:07,470
and that he had this laugh.

1119
01:18:07,644 --> 01:18:09,777
She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1120
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,040
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

1121
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:14,172
<i>"His dumb laugh."</i>

1122
01:18:14,346 --> 01:18:15,913
Yes.

1123
01:18:16,871 --> 01:18:18,220
What else did she tell you?

1124
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:24,530
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1125
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:27,620
So that he would feel
better about it.

1126
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:29,013
So that he would stop crying,

1127
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:31,015
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1128
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,409
What was the story?

1129
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:37,065
That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1130
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,677
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1131
01:18:41,504 --> 01:18:42,287
And?

1132
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:45,029
And she...

1133
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,075
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

1134
01:18:47,249 --> 01:18:49,164
around this made-up story.

1135
01:18:49,338 --> 01:18:52,210
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

1136
01:18:54,256 --> 01:18:57,172
She made fun of him
for doing that?

1137
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,087
She just thought
it was ridiculous

1138
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:00,610
that he thought
he could make people laugh.

1139
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:02,612
I mean, she said Arthur
wasn't funny at all.

1140
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:06,572
<i>Did she tell you
that he had been</i>

1141

<i>in and out of institutions
his whole life?</i>

1142
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:10,663

1143
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:13,710

That he had never had
a girlfriend

1175
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,758
and she thought
he was probably a virgin.

You're fired.

1185
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:29,601
Arthur, don't do this.
This is real.

1186
01:22:29,775 --> 01:22:31,342
You'd better believe it's real.

1187
01:22:31,516 --> 01:22:33,475
I want order in my court. Order!

1188
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:38,610
Bailiff! Take Mr. Fleck

01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:59,153
This way? Thank you.

1192
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,376
Hey, no touching.

1193
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,901
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1194
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:18,737
You should see it out there.
They're all going crazy for you.

1195
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:22,915
You did it.

1196
01:23:26,441 --> 01:23:30,010
I know, but maybe I should read
a law book or something.

1197
01:23:31,446 --> 01:23:33,926
You know I never went
to high school?

1198
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:38,627
I said, no touching.

1199
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:46,809
You can do anything you want.

1200
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,030
You're Joker.

<i>of Arthur Fleck downtown today.</i>

1206
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:28,242
<i>Fleck, the accused killer,
also known as Joker,</i>

1207
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:30,113
<i>interrupted testimony</i>

1208
01:24:30,287 --> 01:24:33,029
<i>and fired his lawyer
Maryanne Stewart in open court.</i>

1209
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:35,205
<i>Then he kissed her goodbye.</i>

1210
01:24:35,379 --> 01:24:37,077
<i>Afterwards, Fleck
was extensively questioned</i>

1211
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,427
<i>by Judge Herman Rothwax.</i>

1212
01:24:39,601 --> 01:24:41,951
<i>The right
of self-representation</i>

1213
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,520
<i>is not a license to abuse
the dignity of the courtroom.</i>

1214
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:48,000
<i>Can you control your emotions,
Mr. Fleck?</i>

1215
01:24:48,175 --> 01:24:49,437
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1216
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:51,178
<i>Judge Rothwax reluctantly</i>

1217
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,702
<i>approved Fleck's request
to represent himself,</i>

1218
01:24:53,876 --> 01:24:56,444
<i>as long as he agreed
to stand-by counsel.</i>

<i>Maryanne Stewart
and Assistant DA, Harvey Dent</i>

<i>disagree with.</i>

1222
01:25:03,059 --> 01:25:05,148
<i>It's really tragic.</i>

1223
01:25:05,322 --> 01:25:07,716
<i>Arthur believes he has
all of these supporters,</i>

1224
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:09,979
<i>but they don't care about him.</i>

<i>He's not dealing with reality.</i>

1227

<i>He's mentally ill.</i>

1228

<i>If we could have
just convinced him of that</i>

Go marching in ♪</i>

1263
01:26:59,436 --> 01:27:03,048
After reviewing all the case law
that offers precedent,

1264
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:06,226
<i>Jensen v. Superior Court</i>
being the most relevant,

1265
01:27:07,444 --> 01:27:09,185
I have reluctantly decided

1266
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,188
that Mr. Fleck
does have the right

1267
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:15,452
as an attorney,
to dress himself how he likes...

1268
01:27:17,019 --> 01:27:18,542
...as long as he doesn't
cause disorder

1269
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:21,806
or interfere with
the functioning of the Court.

1270
01:27:22,764 --> 01:27:24,548
<i>I will not allow
this proceeding</i>

1271
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:27,072
<i>to become as unruly
as it is outside.</i>

1272
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,639
<i>And I will not let you</i>

1273
01:27:28,813 --> 01:27:30,989
<i>turn this into
any more of a circus</i>

1274
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,382
<i>than you already have.</i>

1275
01:27:32,556 --> 01:27:34,689
Thank you.

1276
01:27:34,863 --> 01:27:37,648
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1277
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,046
The State calls Gary Puddles.

1278
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:46,178
Bailiff?

1279
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:48,180
Will you please escort
Mr. Puddles to the stand?

1280
01:28:09,419 --> 01:28:10,377
Gary.

1281
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:15,512
Go get 'em.

1282
01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:43,584
Please raise your right hand.

1283
01:28:46,413 --> 01:28:47,805
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

1284
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:49,590
you're about to give
is the whole truth

1285
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:52,157
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1286
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:53,376
I do.

1287
01:28:57,467 --> 01:28:58,773
Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

1288
01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:00,601
Thank you for being here.

1289
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:06,694
So one last question, sir.

1290
01:29:06,868 --> 01:29:09,523
The person who you saw

1291
01:29:09,697 --> 01:29:11,829
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death,

1292
01:29:13,788 --> 01:29:15,311
are they in this courtroom
here today?

1293
01:29:15,485 --> 01:29:16,617
Yes.

1294
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,097
Can you point him out
to all of us?

1295
01:29:19,533 --> 01:29:23,232
And... describe his clothing?

1296
01:29:25,147 --> 01:29:27,715
He's... He's sitting right there
at the table.

1297
01:29:28,455 --> 01:29:31,240
Wearing a red suit
and clown make-up.

1298
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:33,982
May the record reflect

1299
01:29:34,156 --> 01:29:36,550
the identification
of the accused, Your Honor?

1300
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:38,073
Yes, it will.

1301
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,467
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1302
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:45,385
Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

1303
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:56,483
Mr. Puddles.

1304
01:29:58,485 --> 01:30:00,835
Gary Puddles?

1305
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:06,057
Tell me, sir,
is that your God-given name?

1306
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:08,495
Yes.

1307
01:30:09,191 --> 01:30:10,453
Really?

1308
01:30:11,193 --> 01:30:14,152
Really?
Your last name is Puddles?

1309
01:30:16,807 --> 01:30:20,463
Why, it sounds like a... a joke.

1310
01:30:21,246 --> 01:30:21,986
Well, it's not.

1311
01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:26,948
You expect us to believe
that your last name is Puddles?

1312
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,384
Puddles?

1313
01:30:28,558 --> 01:30:31,256
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

1314
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:35,173
As I said, I'm not gonna let you
turn my courtroom into a circus.

1315
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,784
Okay.

1316
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:39,917
But, um, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

1317
01:30:40,091 --> 01:30:42,137
don't you think
it's a little late for that?

1318
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:43,878
- Don't try my patience.
- Okay. Okay.

1319
01:30:47,011 --> 01:30:49,579
Mr. Puddles...

1320
01:30:50,537 --> 01:30:53,540
earlier this afternoon
you testified

1321
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,804
that you saw me stab
Mr. Kliman Manhoff

1322
01:30:56,978 --> 01:31:00,242
in the neck a couple of times.
Correct?

1323
01:31:01,112 --> 01:31:01,983
Kleinmanhoffer.

1324
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,029
Yes, I saw you.

1325
01:31:05,203 --> 01:31:06,640
Mm.

1326
01:31:06,814 --> 01:31:10,078
And what else
did you see that day?

1327
01:31:11,645 --> 01:31:14,517
You stabbing him in the eye,

1328
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:17,085
and bashing his head
into the wall,

1329
01:31:17,259 --> 01:31:19,870
many, many times.

1330
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,788
Yes, but, uh, Randall
was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?

1331
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,922
He didn't deserve to die.

1332
01:31:30,054 --> 01:31:31,839
I don't know.

1333
01:31:32,013 --> 01:31:33,318
Eh, never mind.

1334
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:36,234
Gary, did you catch my act

1335
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,672
on <i>The Murray Franklin Show</i>
later that night?

1336
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,369
No, I didn't.

1337
01:31:40,543 --> 01:31:41,631
No?

1338
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,070
Might I remind you
that you are under oath?

1339
01:31:46,244 --> 01:31:48,116
I was locked up
at the police station.

1340
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,857
In an interview room.

1341
01:31:50,858 --> 01:31:53,121
'Cause they thought
you might come and kill me.

1342
01:31:54,557 --> 01:31:55,732
I was the only witness.

1343
01:31:55,906 --> 01:31:57,691
They kept me in there all night.

1344
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,173
Isn't that convenient,
Mr. Puddles?

1345
01:32:02,347 --> 01:32:05,089
That you didn't see the show,
you didn't see anything
I had to say,

1346
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:06,656
I can't believe it!

1347
01:32:07,048 --> 01:32:08,005
Mr. Fleck.

1348
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,877
Okay.

1349
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:14,359
Uh, when you were
in my mama's apartment,

1350
01:32:14,534 --> 01:32:16,405
God rest her soul,

1351
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:20,757
when, as you say, you saw me
bash Mr. Klannonmen--

1352
01:32:20,931 --> 01:32:25,545
whatever's-- head into the wall,
"many, many times,"

1353
01:32:27,242 --> 01:32:28,809
did I seem crazy to you?

1354
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:33,944
Did I seem
like a different person?

1355
01:32:34,118 --> 01:32:40,777
Or was I the same old Joker
that I always been?

1356
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:45,782
Arthur, don't do this
to yourself, it isn't you.

1357
01:32:46,217 --> 01:32:49,612
It isn't me?
So you don't think this is me?

1358
01:32:49,786 --> 01:32:53,442
Well, maybe... maybe...
you don't know who I really was.

1359
01:32:56,314 --> 01:32:57,794
I never saw that side of you.

1360
01:32:57,968 --> 01:32:59,535
Well, maybe you weren't looking.

1361
01:33:00,362 --> 01:33:01,929
Maybe no one was.

1362
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:05,889
Because nobody knew I existed.

1363
01:33:06,063 --> 01:33:08,457
But look around,
look at all these people.

1364
01:33:08,631 --> 01:33:12,156
Everyone outside. These cameras.

1365
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,333
Who do you think they see,
Mr. Puddles?

1366
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:18,162
Joker.

1367
01:33:20,948 --> 01:33:22,993
Oh, sweet child,

1368
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:28,912
what you have proven here today,
is that you are no different

1369
01:33:29,086 --> 01:33:32,046
than any of those people
that underestimated me.

1370
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,961
<i>From Murray Franklin,</i>

1371
01:33:34,135 --> 01:33:38,487
<i>to those goddamn fat,
stupid guards at Arkham.</i>

1372
01:33:38,661 --> 01:33:40,837
<i>They think that
they can treat me like trash.</i>

1373
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:42,404

1374
01:33:42,578 --> 01:33:44,536
<i>or you, or you,</i>

1375

<i>or any of you to keep me down.</i>

1376
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:50,194
<i>I am free!</i>

1377
01:33:55,156 --> 01:33:56,853
Why are you doing this
to me, Arthur?

1378
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:58,333
What?

1379
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,727
Gary, I like you.

1380
01:34:01,466 --> 01:34:03,947
I told you I wouldn't hurt you,
and I didn't.

1381
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:05,427
Not hurt me?

1382
01:34:07,385 --> 01:34:09,344
I couldn't go back to work.

1383
01:34:10,214 --> 01:34:14,131
I still can't sleep,
and I'm scared all the time.

1384
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,265
I never used to be scared.

1385
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:21,965
I'm scared right now, here.
With you in front of me.

1386
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:27,101
I couldn't do anything that day.

1387
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:30,495
I felt so small.

1388
01:34:31,671 --> 01:34:34,674
I was reminded
how powerless I really am.

1389
01:34:36,632 --> 01:34:39,504
Oh... you got
a flair for the dramatic.

1390
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,333
You are tugging at
my heart strings, little Gary.

1391
01:34:46,686 --> 01:34:48,470
No more-- no more questions,
Your Honor.

1392
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,039
Do you know
what that feels like, Arthur?

1393
01:34:52,213 --> 01:34:53,910
Oh, fuck!

1394
01:34:54,084 --> 01:34:58,088
You were the only one at work
who never made fun of me.

1395
01:34:59,002 --> 01:35:01,265
You were the only one
that was nice to me.

1396
01:35:04,138 --> 01:35:07,097
I said, no more questions,
Your Honor!

1397
01:35:11,493 --> 01:35:13,451
Very well, Mr. Puddles.

1398
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,453
The court thanks you
for your testimony.

1399
01:35:17,499 --> 01:35:19,588
Please step down,
you're excused.

1400
01:35:34,298 --> 01:35:35,952
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1401
01:35:38,868 --> 01:35:40,696
We're not calling
any more witnesses, Your Honor.

1402
01:35:41,697 --> 01:35:43,525
That is the State's case.

1403
01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:44,787
The State rests.

1404
01:35:45,701 --> 01:35:46,615
Very well.

1405
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:49,400
All right, Mr. Fleck,

1406
01:35:49,574 --> 01:35:52,229
at this point,
you may mount your defense.

1407
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:57,626
The defense rests as well,
Your Honor.

1408
01:35:59,193 --> 01:36:00,498
Pardon?

1409
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:04,851
Mr. Fleck, you don't want
to put on any defense?

1410
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:07,897
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

1411
01:36:08,332 --> 01:36:10,552
"Th-Th-Th-That's all folks."

1412
01:36:10,726 --> 01:36:12,597
All right, all right.

1413
01:36:14,164 --> 01:36:15,209
All right.

1414
01:36:17,254 --> 01:36:19,430
<i>That's enough!
This is a court of law!</i>

1415
01:36:22,216 --> 01:36:24,348
<i>With both sides having rested,</i>

1416
01:36:25,393 --> 01:36:29,310
<i>this court will recess
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.</i>

1417
01:36:29,484 --> 01:36:32,052
You made our case
for us, you fucking idiot!

1418
01:36:32,226 --> 01:36:33,531
You're gonna fry

Anything you want to say?

1421
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,884
Arthur, will you be convicted?

1422
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,320
Arthur, over here.

1423

Where do you think you stand,
Arthur?

1425
01:36:45,979 --> 01:36:47,589
What are you
gonna do if they let you off?

01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:18,729
What?

1492
01:41:19,817 --> 01:41:20,862
Move.

1493
01:41:21,036 --> 01:41:22,168
Easy, darling.

1494
01:41:27,825 --> 01:41:30,393
Why is everyone
so upset with me?

1495
01:41:30,567 --> 01:41:31,742
Move your ass.

1496
01:41:33,309 --> 01:41:34,354
Come on, Arthur.

1497
01:41:36,617 --> 01:41:38,445
I'm an attorney now!

1498
01:41:38,619 --> 01:41:40,490
- I will see you in court.
- Shut the fuck up.

1499
01:41:40,664 --> 01:41:42,057
And I'm the fucking
Queen of Sheba.

1500
01:41:42,231 --> 01:41:43,711
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

1501
01:41:46,453 --> 01:41:47,193
Yeah?

1502
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:49,499

1503
01:41:50,109 --> 01:41:51,066
Grab his legs, Mac.

1504
01:41:52,937 --> 01:41:53,851
Let's go.

1505
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,291
Had to go and be
a big shot on TV.

1506
01:41:58,465 --> 01:41:59,727
I think he knocked himself out.

1507
01:42:03,209 --> 01:42:04,340
Motherfucker.

1508
01:42:07,213 --> 01:42:07,996
Stand him up.

1509
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:15,656
All right, I get it.
I get it, Jackie.

1510
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,875
You wanna--
You wanna hear a joke, right?

1511
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,616
You really think...

1512
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:21,357
...fancy red suit

1513
01:42:21,531 --> 01:42:23,838
and muck on your face
makes you better than us?

1514
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:27,320
You have no fucking idea
what it takes,

1515
01:42:27,494 --> 01:42:30,453
put a little bit of joy
into this fucking place.

1516
01:42:30,627 --> 01:42:33,108
Let me tell you one I used to do
about my mother.

1517
01:42:33,282 --> 01:42:34,544
You can drop the act now.

1518
01:42:34,718 --> 01:42:35,893
- My mother was...
- Because we know

1519
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,939
it's only Arthur in there, okay?

1520
01:42:38,113 --> 01:42:40,376
And she only dated abusive guys.

1521
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:41,464
Yeah, is that right?

1522
01:42:41,638 --> 01:42:43,771
And, I asked her, I said,

1523
01:42:43,945 --> 01:42:47,905
"Mom, why do you stay
with your abusive boyfriend?"

1524
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:49,820
And she said...

1525
01:42:49,994 --> 01:42:51,344
"Beats the hell out of me."

1526
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,216
I told you to drop it.

1527
01:42:55,913 --> 01:42:57,263
Oh, he liked it!

1528
01:43:03,617 --> 01:43:05,314
Oh, Jackie...

1529
01:43:05,488 --> 01:43:07,186
aren't you gonna
buy me a drink first?

1530
01:43:09,318 --> 01:43:11,059
Let's go, let's go.

1531
01:43:11,233 --> 01:43:12,974
- Let's fucking go!
- No!

1532
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:18,806
- Get the fuck in there!
- No!

1533
01:43:19,502 --> 01:43:21,983
- Let go!
- Get that fucking jacket off.

1534
01:43:22,157 --> 01:43:23,680

A word of caution.
This is not a comedy club.

1585
01:47:37,847 --> 01:47:39,762

I... I wanted to come out here

1589
01:48:32,467 --> 01:48:37,167
And I was gonna go on a...

1590
01:48:37,994 --> 01:48:39,169
And blame all of you,

1591

1592
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:47,961
...for this

There is no Joker.

1598

1599
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:26,434

I wish I didn't, but I did.

1601
01:49:35,922 --> 01:49:38,925
Nobody knows, but...
I also killed my mother.

1602
01:49:41,057 --> 01:49:46,497
Put a... pillow over her face,
and smothered her to death.

1603

1606

Settle down.

1607
01:50:35,764 --> 01:50:37,636
Knock... knock.

1608
01:50:39,942 --> 01:50:40,900

Come back, man. Joker.

1733
02:00:44,416 --> 02:00:45,982
Fuck.

1734
02:00:46,156 --> 02:00:47,332
No!

1735
02:00:47,506 --> 02:00:48,855
Where are you going, man?

1736
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:50,596
We still love you.

1737
02:00:51,205 --> 02:00:52,598
We love you, Joker.

1738
02:00:52,989 --> 02:00:54,208
Joker!

1739
02:00:57,733 --> 02:00:59,213
Joker!

1740
02:01:31,506 --> 02:01:32,594
Lee?

1741
02:01:37,512 --> 02:01:38,383
Lee!

1742
02:02:04,234 --> 02:02:05,584
Look at you.

1743
02:02:08,761 --> 02:02:09,849
You cut your hair.

1744
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:21,382
Someone blew up the courthouse,
and I'm free.

1745
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:26,126
We can go away.

1746
02:02:32,698 --> 02:02:34,221
Lee, you hear me?

1747
02:02:35,091 --> 02:02:37,006
Someone blew up the courthouse.

1748
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,138
We can go.

1749
02:02:40,445 --> 02:02:41,489
I escaped.

1750
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:45,667
We're not going away, Arthur.

1751
02:02:48,017 --> 02:02:51,064
All we had was the fantasy,
and you gave up.

1752
02:02:54,067 --> 02:02:55,547
We were never going anywhere.

1753
02:03:02,641 --> 02:03:04,382
I'm that same guy
you fell in love with.

1754
02:03:06,558 --> 02:03:09,387
I'm the same guy
that murdered Murray Franklin.

1755
02:03:10,475 --> 02:03:11,389
No.

1756
02:03:13,042 --> 02:03:14,087
No, you're not.

1757
02:03:15,567 --> 02:03:17,264
There is no Joker.

1758
02:03:18,396 --> 02:03:19,788
That's what you said, isn't it?

1759
02:03:28,057 --> 02:03:29,842
I can't--

1760
02:03:30,495 --> 02:03:32,584
I can't--
I can't live without you.

1761

Let's go, you got a visitor.

02:05:54,813 --> 02:05:56,423
No fucking cigarettes left.

1786
02:06:12,047 --> 02:06:13,483
Let's go.

1787
02:06:19,533 --> 02:06:21,230
Hey, Arthur. Hold up.

1788
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,757
Can I tell you a joke
I came up with?

1789
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:27,802
Um...

1790
02:06:27,976 --> 02:06:29,282
Is it quick?

1791
02:06:29,456 --> 02:06:30,675
Yeah, I can make it quick.

Okay.

1793
02:06:33,242 --> 02:06:35,897
So, a psychopath walks
into a bar,

1794
02:06:36,071 --> 02:06:38,770
and sees this famous clown
sitting there all alone.

1795
02:06:39,248 --> 02:06:40,859
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

1796
02:06:41,773 --> 02:06:43,949
"I can't believe you're here,"
he says.

1797
02:06:44,471 --> 02:06:49,128
"What a disappointment.
I used to watch you on TV.

1798
02:06:50,651 --> 02:06:52,348
What can I get you?"

1799
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:54,786
And this clown turns and says,

1800
02:06:55,917 --> 02:06:58,790
"Well, if you're buying
you can get me anything."

1801
02:07:01,314 --> 02:07:03,621
"Perfect," the psychopath says.

1802
02:07:03,795 --> 02:07:05,797
"How about I get you
what you fucking deserve?"

1803
02:07:34,652 --> 02:07:37,524
