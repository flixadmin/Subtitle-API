00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,085
a little bit of time

178
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,587
to get a handle

179
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,587
on my newfound power,

180
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,257
and maybe I should woodshed

181
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,257
my magic by myself, hey?

182
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,383
- Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,383
I think that's best.

184
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,137
- Oh, come on,

185
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,137
don't be like that.

186
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,721
Come on, love.

187
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,721
I mean--

188
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,266
my love, ju--

189
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,517
Damn it, Johnny!

190
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,647
- John's lying to me, again.

191
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,232
- Huh, glad he's feeling

192
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,232
like his old self.

193
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,109
- No, he's--he's trying

194
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,109
to blame his behavior

195
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,944
on the Fountain,

196
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,944
but I don't buy it.

197
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,738
Can't you whip up some kind

198
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,738
of truth serum or whatever?

199
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,323
- Yeah. It's called scotch.

200
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,742
- Hey, I'm serious.

201
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,327
You would still

202
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,327
be stuck in that game

203
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,121
if it weren't for me.

204
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,872
Please.

205
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,374
- Look, if you wanna find out

206
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,374
what happened with John

207
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,087
at the Fountain,

208
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,087
it is not my help you need.

209
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,465
- Spoon's.

210
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,801
That is a great idea.

211
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,801
She can help us, come on.

212
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,387
- I guess my life could use

213
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,387
a little more drama.

214
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,976
- I was hoping we'd have

215
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,976
a chance to kibbitz.

216
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,394
Get to know each other,

217
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,394
just you and me.

218
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,105
- But you already know me.

219
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,858
You had a planet full of mes,

220
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,858
didn't you?

221
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
- Don't sell yourself so short.

222
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,737
Sara could have had

223
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,737
her pick of my Avas,

224
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
yet she turned over the heavens

225
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
to get back to you.

226
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,701
So, what makes you so special?

227
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,619
- [laughs]

228
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,164
Sara said you'd do this.

229
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,164
Try to get into my head.

230
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,209
- Like she isn't interested

231
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,209
in getting into mine?

232
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,294
- I knew this was a mistake.

233
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,296
- No.

234
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,296
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

235
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,007
Please. Don't go.

236
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,176
We've hardly broken the ice.

237
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,680
- Hmm, thatagirl.

238
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,680
You see that?

239
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,559
Making Bishop think that

240
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,559
she's the vulnerable one.

241
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,394
- You know what, you can play

242
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,394
nice all you want,

243
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,938
but it still doesn't excuse

244
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,606
the fact that you kidnap

245
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,606
the woman that I love.

246
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,067
- But the fact that I did so

247
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,067
in order

248
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,319
to save all of humanity...

249
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,319
changes nothing.

250
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,695
You're right.

251
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:48,116
I was an arrogant

252
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:48,116
egomaniacal...

253
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,576
meanie.

254
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,661
- And so what now? Hmm?

255
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,538
You've come here

256
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,538
to turn over a new leaf.

257
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,874
Is that what we're all

258
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,874
supposed to believe?

259
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,919
- [sighs]

260
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,919
Where else would I go?

261
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,129
What else would I do?

262
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:05,008
Look, I know this is

263
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:05,008
gonna sound perverse, but...

264
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,760
[exhales]

265
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,553
- But what?

266
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,891
- You and Sara are the closest

267
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,891
thing I have left to family.

268
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,477
I know. Sounds insane.

269
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,273
- No, I get it actually.

270
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,857
You're a clone. I'm a clone

271
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,986
and it's not like I have

272
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,986
any real family, so...sure.

273
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:30,742
I guess in some perverse way,

274
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:30,742
we are...like family.

275
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,913
- Playing him like a fiddle.

276
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,164
- Bishop's not gonna

277
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,164
let himself

278
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,624
be manipulated

279
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,624
that easily.

280
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,169
- Can I...tell you a secret?

281
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,881
You...were always

282
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,881
my favorite Ava.

283
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,427
Not you personally, of course.

284
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,427
Your model.

285
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,346
- You mean bossy Ava?

286
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,807
- Ugh. A moniker our marketing

287
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,807
department came up with.

288
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,101
I wanted to call you Boss Ava.

289
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,436
Only people were afraid

290
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,436
of a clone

291
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,104
that would tell them

292
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,104
what to do,

293
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,815
except that is precisely

294
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,815
what you were designed for.

295
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,111
But you have exceeded

296
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,111
my wildest dreams.

297
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,114
You're getting married.

298
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,114
[chuckles]

299
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,532
Didn't see that one coming.

300
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,118
- Why not?

301
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,995
- I lower the oxytocin levels

302
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,995
in all the clones,

303
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,746
the so-called love hormone.

304
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,290
I don't want you

305
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,290
falling in love.

306
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,792
It hurts productivity.

307
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,711
- Huh. Maybe that's why

308
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,711
I'm having such a hard time

309
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,088
planning this damn wedding.

310
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,007
Productivity is usually

311
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,007
my strong suit

312
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,550
and I can't even put together

313
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,550
a seating arrangement.

314
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,512
- Maybe I can help--not like I

315
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,512
have anything else to do it.

316
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,764
And it'll be fun.

317
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,683
- If Sara even knew

318
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,683
I was talking to you--

319
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,103
- Oh, c'mon.

320
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,103
It'll be our little secret.

321
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,481
- How do I know that you're not

322
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,481
just doing this

323
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,024
to get me to let my guard down?

324
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,526
- I am doing this so that

325
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,526
you let your guard down.

326
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:50,405
I want to get to know you, Ava.

327
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,992
- I have to go.

328
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,910
- I can also help

329
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,910
your friend Rory.

330
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,873
- What? What's wrong with Rory?

331
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,916
- Nothing...yet.

332
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,086
But those babies in his head

333
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,086
are getting hungry.

334
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,254
- How the hell did you

335
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,254
know about--

336
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,131
- Kayla letting him live?

337
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,425
The fact that he's experiencing

338
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,425
headaches, that luxurious hair.

339
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,135
Doesn't take a genius

340
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,135
to realize

341
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,388
he mated with a Necrian.

342
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,890
I spent eons trying

343
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,890
to meld humans and aliens

344
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,185
and never thought to do it

345
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,185
the old-fashioned way.

346
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,895
I can help you save Rory

347
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,895
by giving his spawn

348
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,482
the proper nutrients.

349
