1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,958
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,916
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,002
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,929
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,131
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,969
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,351
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,978
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,276
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,945
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,067
<i>Is that what you think I am?</i>

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,069
- Some sort of evil secretary?
- You tell me.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,527
I am now and forever will be
my husband's partner.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,783
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lanse.

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,291
- Hello, Mr. Allen.
- DeVoe?

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,997
<i>If you hurt my family...</i>

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,791
<i>I have no interest in your family.</i>

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,248
<i>Besides, you're gonna need someone
to miss you when you're gone.</i>

19
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,332
<i>What did you do?</i>

20
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,416
I left something for you.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,585
<i>I don't have need for it anymore.</i>

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,297
Barry Allen, you're under arrest
for the murder of Clifford DeVoe.

23
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,258
<i>My name is Barry Allen.</i>

24
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,305
<i>And I'm an innocent man.</i>

25
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,152
<i>I know that you'll find
my fingerprints all over his body.</i>

26
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,317
<i>And I know that
you'll find his DNA on mine.</i>

27
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:23,198
<i>But I don't know who stabbed him,</i>

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,164
<i>or how he ended up in my loft.</i>

29
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,757
<i>All I can tell you is
I'm being framed</i>

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,793
<i>for something I didn't do.</i>

31
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,673
I didn't kill Clifford DeVoe.

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,478
All right, Allen, let's run it back
from the beginning.

33
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,658
<i>This is exactly
what DeVoe wanted,</i>

34
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,409
and we all played
right into his plan. Especially me.

35
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,285
Why would DeVoe wanna
orchestrate all of this?

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,582
I don't know.

37
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,251
But we know that this started
when I was still in the Speed Force.

38
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,454
But why target Dominic?

39
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,914
Dominic's power must have
allowed DeVoe to inhabit his body.

40
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,499
We should have been
on top of this earlier.

41
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,760
What about the other metas
on the bus? Why create them?

42
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,554
Part of a larger plan.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,806
How are you even here
right now, Allen?

44
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,978
Aren't you on house arrest?

45
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,647
- Yeah. Well...
- He's at Joe's actually.

46
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,186
Either that or at the courthouse.

47
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,019
I managed to hack into
the ankle-monitor GPS.

48
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,862
That's not the only thing
Cisco hacked.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,356
When you came out of the Speed Force,

50
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,986
you were talking gibberish
at C.C.P.D.

51
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,239
You said something about
not wanting to kill anyone.

52
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,695
I digitally scrubbed the video.

53
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,533
Last thing we want is
somebody hearing something

54
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,240
we don't want them to hear.

55
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,623
<i>Your Honor, I'm innocent.
I didn't do this.</i>

56
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,420
<i>I didn't kill anyone.</i>

57
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,088
Yeah, I mean, I don't remember
saying any of that.

58
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,673
- You don't?
- No.

59
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,588
We should look at
everything Allen said

60
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,011
when he first came
out of the Speed Force.

61
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,884
- Might give us a clue.
- That's a good idea.

62
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,134
Okay, guys, but remember,

63
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,137
I mean, considering all the evidence
they have against me,

64
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,014
this trial is not even gonna
last very long.

65
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,972
Okay. But with Cecile taking
a leave of absence to represent you,

66
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,351
you got the best lawyer in town.

67
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,431
Yeah.

68
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,767
And even if they did find you guilty,

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,192
it's not like any prison
can hold you.

70
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,858
Well, I'm not gonna run.

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,776
I won't be a fugitive.

72
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,858
If I'm convicted,
I have to go to prison.

73
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,284
We're not gonna let that happen.

74
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,283
Right.

75
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,955
<i>Let's get to work.</i>

76
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,252
- We should get to the courthouse.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,923
How are you doing?

78
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,501
They say the first year of
marriage is always the hardest.

79
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,846
But I never thought my husband
being on trial for murder

80
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,173
would be one of the challenges.

81
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,974
We have been through so much.

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,392
We'll get through this, too.

83
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,221
Will we, Barry?

84
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,057
I know the Speed Force gave you
a new outlook on life, but...

85
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,193
I don't know if being positive
is enough right now.

86
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,397
I'm just trying to be strong
for the team and for you.

87
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,233
Remember, we're the Flash.

88
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,653
We're the Flash.

89
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,205
Ralph, hold up.

90
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,123
Listen, I'm not gonna let
Barry go to prison.

91
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,666
I failed his dad,
I'm not gonna fail him.

92
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,914
I need your help.

93
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,916
My help?
As in, the stretchy kind?

94
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,248
As in "the underhanded
private investigator" kind.

95
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,377
Oh, uh...

96
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,676
- No offense taken.
- Come on.

97
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,139
Science has long pondered
what would be required

98
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:31,219
to successfully transfer consciousness
from one living being to another.

99
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,187
But we've accomplished far beyond
a simple transfer of consciousness.

100
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,817
We've extracted that which elevates
our humanity, and added upon it.

101
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,491
I am both who I was before,

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,952
and who I desire to become.

103
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,165
Yes, you are, my love.

104
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,045
My hand still feels foreign
upon your flesh.

105
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,632
And you don't care for it.

106
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,252
No, I do.

107
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,298
As I said, I inherited
my host's ability to read thoughts.

108
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,011
We have never lied
to each other before.

109
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,345
Let's not begin now.

110
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,230
Okay.

111
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,108
Marlize, my love,

112
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,027
see past this body,

113
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,818
see past these eyes.

114
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,119
See me, Clifford.

115
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,575
Clifford.

116
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,080
I am nothing without you.

117
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,553
<i>Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</i>

118
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,353
for you to understand what it is
I'm about to tell you today,

119
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,558
you need to do something.

120
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,028
I need you to believe
in the impossible.

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,902
<i>As children, we're taught</i>

122
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,655
<i>that the police are there
to protect us, to serve.</i>

123
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,077
We're told that
our tax dollars go toward

124
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,997
training them to be
the champions of the city.

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,163
<i>But for some of us,
it still seems impossible</i>

126
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,664
that a police investigator,

127
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,963
one of Central City's finest,
could betray that trust.

128
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>And even worse, under the guise
of upholding the law to commit</i>

129
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,050
the most heinous act that one person
could carry out against another.

130
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,590
But that is exactly
what Barry Allen did.

131
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,468
<i>And the prosecution
will prove beyond any doubt</i>

132
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,600
that he stood among us
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

133
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,306
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

134
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,524
Barry Allen wears a mask.

135
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,277
<i>He used his connection to the law,</i>

136
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>his experience as
a police investigator,</i>

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,231
especially as
a crime scene technician,

138
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,945
to stalk a beloved professor, husband,

139
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,115
and murder Clifford DeVoe
in cold blood.

140
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,954
All right, Mr. Borman,
just sign on the dotted line

141
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,630
and your savings account
is all set up.

142
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,341
I appreciate you helping me out.
I wanna get this right.

143
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,713
It's my first savings account.

144
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,963
You okay?

145
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,388
Yeah. Just a little light-headed
before lunch, I guess.

146
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,848
Have a great day.

147
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,872
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

148
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
the document in my hand

149
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,453
is a court-issued restraining order.

150
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,783
It's issued to Marlize DeVoe,

151
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,914
the wife of the victim,
on behalf of her husband,

152
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,082
against a Mr. Bartholomew
Henry Allen.

153
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,467
Now, if you'd like a better look,
I have a bigger copy.

154
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,011
<i>But if you allow me to call out
what's written underneath</i>

155
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,681
"reason for order issue..."
"Harassment."

156
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,803
Defendant was seen just days earlier,

157
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,513
illegally breaking and entering
into the victim's house,

158
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,564
searching through
the victim's effects.

159
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,267
<i>A man obsessed.</i>

160
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,527
Barry Allen's skin cells were found
under the nails of the victim.

161
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,777
Now, imagine that if you can.

162
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,328
Mr. DeVoe, a man in a wheelchair,
desperately trying to defend himself

163
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,747
<i>as Mr. Allen sought to overpower him.</i>

164
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:25,124
And finally, this is the knife
that was used to kill Clifford DeVoe.

165
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,089
If it looks new,
that's because it is.

166
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,876
It was a wedding gift to Mr. Allen.

167
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,546
Now, let's just let that
sink in for a moment.

168
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,597
This was supposed to commemorate

169
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,017
the most joyous moments
in a couple's lives.

170
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,810
<i>But instead, Mr. Allen used it</i>

171
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,559
<i>to forever separate a couple
from one another.</i>

172
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,392
He used a wedding gift
as a murder weapon.

173
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,228
<i>That is a special kind of evil.</i>

174
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,692
<i>But it showed an absolute disregard...</i>

175
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,863
Cisco.

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,987
There's a meta attack downtown.
We gotta go.

177
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,365
I'll stay here with Barry.

178
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,506
When you're done here get some
coverage of the workstations.

179
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,083
Detective, would you get
a statement, please?

180
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,010
- Mr. Ramon.
- Captain.

181
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,086
What happened here?

182
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,265
Vintage Central City.
Meaning, another weird one.

183
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,060
No data breach, nothing stolen,
everyone just collapsed.

184
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,059
I have officers at the hospital
interviewing people now.

185
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,811
But so far, no one knows anything.

186
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,108
<i>Oh.</i>

187
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,401
Dark matter city.

188
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,275
Yeah, we're definitely
dealing with a meta here.

189
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,356
You wanna see what kind of perimeter
we're dealing with?

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,690
You read my mind.

191
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,703
Hey, Joe, are you sure
you're okay to run this case?

192
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,665
Because I totally understand
if you need a little more time...

193
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,667
I'm fine. Really.

194
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,586
I may have to go over
to the courthouse later.

195
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,588
Yeah...

196
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,292
I'm actually heading
over there myself.

197
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,637
The prosecution called me to testify.

198
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,422
<i>I'm sorry, Joe.</i>

199
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,758
<i>You know how much I care about Barry,</i>

200
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,059
but I have to tell them what I know.

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,477
I get it.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

202
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,808
Yeah.

203
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,359
Do I need to repeat the question?

204
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,906
No, I heard it.

205
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,031
The person standing over
Clifford DeVoe's body

206
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,282
was Barry Allen.

207
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,576
No further questions, Your Honor.

208
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,255
Captain Singh, you stated that
you interviewed Barry Allen

209
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,253
five years ago for the job of CSI.

210
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,960
I wonder, what was
your first impression of him?

211
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,212
He was young.

212
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,307
<i>Had half the experience of
everyone else I interviewed.</i>

213
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,680
Hmm. Why'd you hire him?

214
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,386
It was really something
he said in the interview.

215
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,061
Everyone always talks about
going after the criminal, the guilty,

216
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,148
but Allen said
he wanted to help the victims,

217
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,987
<i>the innocents.</i>

218
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,863
I thought Central City
deserved someone like that.

219
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,870
Allen is one of the good ones.

220
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,583
"One of the good ones."

221
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,413
No further questions, Your Honor.

222
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,006
<i>I'd like to redirect,
Your Honor.</i>

223
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,763
<i>Proceed.</i>

224
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,726
Would you cover for Mr. Allen
if you had to?

225
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,389
No, of course not.

226
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,472
No? It says here
in his personnel file

227
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,104
that he took a six-month sabbatical
to the Czech Republic.

228
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,277
Did he get approval from you first?

229
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,569
Not exactly.

230
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,355
He said it was for
something personal.

231
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,985
I'm sure he had a good reason to go.

232
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,276
Is "saving the world" a good reason?

233
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,865
It also says in here that he was late

234
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,539
seventy-two times in the past two years.

235
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,118
Did you ever ask him why?

236
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,202
No.

237
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,504
Because regardless of
what time he got in,

238
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,001
he always did his job.

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,042
I was just curious to imagine
what he does with his time

240
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,877
instead of being at work.

241
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,964
It's almost like
he has this secret life.

242
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,057
<i>So in spite of all these infractions,</i>

243
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,101
you never thought to discipline him?

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,470
What are you suggesting?

245
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,681
That whether you realize it or not,

246
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,477
you've been covering the ugly truth
about Mr. Allen for years now.

247
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,027
That is not true.

248
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,605
Is it true that he was targeting
and harassing Mr. DeVoe?

249
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,491
Yes or no?

250
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,611
Yes.

251
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,990
Which is why I granted DeVoe
the restraining order

252
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,575
and told Allen to stay away.

253
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,456
But that didn't stop him, did it?
He kept going after him,

254
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,537
right up until the night
that Mr. DeVoe was killed.

255
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,497
Objection. Conjecture.

256
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,707
<i>Withdrawn.</i>

257
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,343
Captain, now you said that

258
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,921
Mr. Allen wants to help the victims
and the innocents.

259
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,383
But disappearing for months
at a time, being late 72 times...

260
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,391
Doesn't sound like he wants to help
or care for anybody but himself.

261
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,649
Now, do you still think that he's
"one of the good ones"?

262
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,029
I hope you're right about this.

263
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,034
Oh, trust me. I'm very good
at reading body language.

264
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,831
Right now, you're tense.

265
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,203
Now, you're annoyed.

266
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,034
<i>Oh. Here we go.</i>

267
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,382
- Yahtzee!
- Did you get that?

268
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,875
Ralphy got it.

269
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,553
I smell an acquittal.

270
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,728
As we thought might happen,
we are in trouble.

271
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,181
David's testimony hurt us,
but we still have a few options.

272
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,890
What are they?

273
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:39,975
I can go to Slater.

274
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,436
I can ask for a plea deal.
Maybe get you a shorter sentence.

275
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,656
Or we could use an insanity defense.

276
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,618
No. Both those options
are admitting I'm guilty, and I'm not.

277
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,288
Fine. Then the only other way
out of this is for you to testify.

278
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,240
Cecile, I'm sorry. I won't do it.

279
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,294
All of the evidence, every bit of it,
it points to you.

280
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,213
<i>If you're not willing to take that stand
and defend yourself,</i>

281
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,756
then this is an impossible case.

282
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm not taking the stand.

283
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,798
Barry, even if that means
turning this case around

284
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,004
and not going to jail?

285
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,635
Iris, if I testify, I have to lie.

286
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,342
I commit perjury.
I become exactly who they think I am.

287
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,685
- Then don't lie.
- What?

288
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,762
Tell the truth.

289
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,602
Tell everyone you're the Flash.

290
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,108
Barry, if the court knows
you're the Flash,

291
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,815
then you can explain everything
and they'll believe you.

292
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,655
Prosecution is gonna wrap up soon.

293
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,281
I need your answer today.

294
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,408
This is the only way, Barry.

295
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,157
Tell the city you're the Flash.

296
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,791
<i>This is all we got?</i>

297
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,884
This isn't a lot to go on.

298
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,633
I know, okay?
We're lucky we even got this footage.

299
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,806
For some reason,
all the security cameras were fried.

300
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,805
Hey, guys, I was just at the hospital
going over the medical records

301
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,227
of everyone who was at the bank.

302
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,726
- I know why they passed out.
- Why did they pass out?

303
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,523
Well, they all suffered from fatigue,

304
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,522
vomiting, abdominal pain,
skin rashes.

305
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,854
So, everyone ate a bad burrito?

306
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,486
No. Radiation poisoning.

307
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,696
That's why the security cameras
are fried.

308
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,529
Mmm-hmm. We gotta find this guy
before he poisons the whole city.

309
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,954
- Yeah, or worse.
- Hmm?

310
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,496
Guys, if this meta can cause these
levels of radiation in these patients,

311
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,170
it means this meta has a similar
make-up to a nuclear bomb.

312
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,466
So, like, enough to blow us all up?
What are we talking here?

313
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,386
The fallout from a nuclear explosion
could be catastrophic.

314
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,004
Exactly.

315
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,839
- "Fallout."
- Great name.

316
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,474
Terrible power.

317
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,020
Okay, I'll see if the satellite
can track his radiation signature.

318
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,975
Mrs. DeVoe, when did you
first meet Mr. Allen?

319
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,309
Um...

320
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,814
Mr. Allen showed up at my house
almost two months ago,

321
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,451
claiming to be investigating
one of Clifford's former colleagues.

322
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,369
We reassured him that we didn't have
information to help him.

323
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,827
But Mr. Allen persisted
and continued to harass my husband.

324
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,128
And what prompted
the restraining order?

325
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,290
My husband has...

326
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,594
Had advancing ALS.

327
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,672
I was alone with Clifford
most of the time.

328
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,009
But something about
Mr. Allen's aggressive manner

329
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,471
just made me feel unsafe,
so we went to the authorities.

330
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,026
And we thought the complaint
would dissuade Mr. Allen.

331
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,894
But it didn't.

332
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,814
<i>Psst.</i>

333
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,947
Could you please
describe for the court

334
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,284
the last time that
you saw your husband?

335
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,544
It was Christmas.

336
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,085
And Clifford wanted to
confront Mr. Allen.

337
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,466
He had hoped that
in the holiday spirit

338
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,589
he could convince him to let us be.

339
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,467
And I...

340
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,341
I begged Clifford not to go.

341
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,052
But even with his disability,

342
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:07,024
<i>Clifford insisted that it was his job
as my husband to protect us,</i>

343
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,192
to protect me.

344
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,778
He didn't wanna live in fear, so...

345
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,363
He left.

346
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,239
And I wish I could have stopped him,
and stepped in,

347
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,450
and told him not to do this.

348
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,786
But I let him go.

349
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,391
<i>No further questions,
Your Honor.</i>

350
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,146
Your Honor, I would like
to enter Exhibit F into evidence.

351
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,191
Objection, Your Honor. Why wasn't
this entered into discovery?

352
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,269
Oh, I've only recently
received this new evidence.

353
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,352
May we approach?

354
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,401
Your Honor, there are protocols
that need to be observed.

355
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,740
This is my courtroom, Mr. Slater.

356
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,489
I'll run it any way I see fit.

357
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,909
I'll allow it.

358
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,455
These photographs
were taken earlier today.

359
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,253
Mrs. DeVoe...

360
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,420
Could you tell me, please,

361
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,342
who's the man that you're kissing
in that photograph?

362
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,175
<i>It is most certainly
not your husband, correct?</i>

363
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,801
His name is Dominic Lanse.

364
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,556
And how long
have you known Mr. Lanse?

365
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,221
A few months.

366
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,229
<i>So it appears to me that perhaps your
marriage was not quite as perfect</i>

367
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,651
<i>as you've portrayed.</i>

368
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,151
Maybe you were ready
for a life without your husband.

369
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,152
<i>So you ran into the arms
of another man.</i>

370
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,656
Another man you convinced
to kill your husband.

371
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,794
Clifford and I met Dominic Lanse
at an ALS charity gala months ago.

372
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,291
<i>He was there to honor his father,</i>

373
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,377
who had recently passed away
with the disease.

374
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,265
<i>Clifford noticed the bond
that Dominic and I</i>

375
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,851
shared, long before I did.

376
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,473
My husband was happy that
I found someone to talk to,

377
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,648
and he urged me to turn to Dominic
for the needs

378
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,605
and comforts
he could no longer fulfill.

379
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,028
My husband wanted me to be happy.

380
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,287
Clifford didn't see
my relationship with Dominic

381
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,003
<i>as a tool to pull us apart,</i>

382
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,254
but to bring us together.

383
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,748
And it did.

384
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,217
My heart will always
belong to Clifford.

385
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,431
No further questions, Your Honor.

386
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,394
<i>You're excused.</i>

387
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,734
Okay, that did not go well.

388
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,857
What's your decision, Barry?

389
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,732
I'm not gonna do it.

390
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,325
Marlize...

391
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,628
Mrs. West-Allen,
I don't think it's appropriate

392
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,171
for the two of us to be seen talking.

393
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,418
Oh, please.

394
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,711
No one is watching, so you can
drop that ridiculous act already.

395
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,638
If you insist.

396
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,637
Why are you doing this?

397
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,230
What is wrong with you?

398
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,892
It's not about what's wrong with me,

399
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,477
it's what's wrong with the world.

400
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,150
There are problems
bigger than your husband.

401
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,815
Such as?

402
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,663
Whatever it is that you are up to,

403
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,165
it will come to an end.

404
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,789
Such passion.

405
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,963
I had that, too, when Clifford and I
first got married.

406
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,916
But passion fades.

407
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,721
And what remains, if you are
fortunate enough, like Clifford and I,

408
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,140
is something deeper than ardor
that cannot be destroyed.

409
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,139
Then why are you so hell-bent
on destroying our lives?

410
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,140
I am doing what I have to do
for my husband, Mrs. West-Allen.

411
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,688
The question
you should truly be asking

412
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,854
is what are you
willing to do for yours?

413
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,442
Hope you enjoy the rest of the show.

414
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,623
<i>Still no word
from the courthouse.</i>

415
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,545
That's good news, right?
No news is good news?

416
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,168
No. Good news is good news.

417
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,500
No news is miscommunication.

418
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,378
<i>The satellite was able to track</i>

419
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,304
a spike in radiation
downtown on Main Street.

420
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,257
- We found him.
- Fallout's on the move.

421
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,512
We gotta get down there now.

422
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,934
I'll monitor him from here.

423
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,727
- Harry, time to book it.
- Yeah.

424
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,439
- I've got two rads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

425
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,405
- Hey, stop!
- Hey!

426
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,949
Stop! Stop!

427
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,234
Stop!

428
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,288
What's going on out there?

429
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,283
Nuclear waste tanker.

430
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,627
Sorry!

431
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,584
Idiots!

432
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,381
- Okay.
- Move along.

433
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,175
<i>Mr. Slater...</i>

434
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,144
<i>Call your next witness.</i>

435
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,683
Thank you, Your Honor.

436
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:39,973
Your Honor...

437
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,517
There's something you need
to know right now

438
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,443
that will alter
the outcome of this case.

439
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,279
<i>Ms. West-Allen,</i>

440
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,608
I have no idea
what you think you're doing.

441
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,909
Explaining what my husband won't.

442
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,534
Barry Allen is...

443
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,539
Barry Allen is...

444
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,757
The...

445
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,346
What's happening?

446
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,258
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

447
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,176
How are you able to do this with me?

448
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,886
I actually don't know.

449
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,096
Iris... Hey...

450
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,101
I already decided
not to tell anyone else who I am.

451
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,777
Barry, if the jury knew
that you were the Flash,

452
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,400
there's no way
that they would convict you.

453
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,322
I'm trying to protect you.

454
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,944
Okay? If everyone knew my secret,
we would never stop running.

455
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,707
I would rather run forever with you
than stand alone without you.

456
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,745
It wouldn't just be us running.

457
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,620
Everyone that has stood by us
the last four years

458
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,622
would have a target on their back.

459
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,003
If criminals knew my name,
they'd know my weakness.

460
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,887
I'm trying to be strong, but I...

461
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,009
I know.

462
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,891
I can't anymore.

463
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,512
How can you...

464
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,980
My dad...

465
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,683
He went through this too.

466
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,111
The trial is not over, Barry.

467
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,359
Yeah, it is.

468
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,446
All the evidence points towards me.

469
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,611
You can't tell them, okay?

470
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,328
Okay.

471
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,209
Yes, Ms. West-Allen?

472
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,460
Um...

473
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,047
Your Honor...

474
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,132
Barry Allen

475
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:38,967
is innocent.

476
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,726
<i>And...</i>

477
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,096
I just thought
you all should know that.

478
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,186
Thank you for your time. Okay.

479
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,703
If there was an award
for Best Crocodile Tears

480
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,576
by the Most
Emotionally Manipulative Widow...

481
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,999
Marlize, definitely in the top three.

482
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,243
Let's snap something
more damning than a lip-lock.

483
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,794
We're not here for that.

484
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,709
Can you do your gross stretchy thing
and slip inside and open the door?

485
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,841
Those are carpet fibers.

486
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,508
Those are from Allen's loft,
aren't they?

487
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,938
You're gonna plant evidence
to frame Marlize.

488
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,102
She was the only one
that could have planted DeVoe's body.

489
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,939
Fibers on the treads of her shoes
places her at the crime scene.

490
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,445
This is the right thing to do, Ralph.

491
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,869
Just open the door. I'll do the rest.

492
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,615
Okay.

493
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,080
It's a solid plan, Joe.

494
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,292
<i>Subtle, but it's crafty
with a touch of pathos.</i>

495
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,508
After this, you're gonna sit back
and kick up your feet

496
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,802
and sleep as sound as a millennial
after Burning Man,

497
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,971
because you did the right thing.

498
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,719
You took down a bad, bad chick.

499
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,844
Ralph, could you hurry up?

500
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,639
And you're gonna ride that feeling
like it's Space Mountain.

501
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:08,436
And then, when they catch you and
they take your badge and your gun,

502
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,308
that self-righteous indignation

503
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,394
is gonna keep your chest puffed
and your chin up,

504
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,070
because you did the right thing.

505
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,278
Sure, you're gonna be mad
for a few years, but that fades,

506
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,904
evolves,

507
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,202
turns into self-pity.

508
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,953
<i>A few more years</i>

509
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,495
and your life is gonna be a shell
of its former self.

510
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,376
<i>And then, one night,</i>

511
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,504
it's gonna dawn on you that

512
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,585
you did the wrong thing,

513
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,967
<i>and it ruined everything.</i>

514
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,385
<i>Your colleagues won't talk to you,</i>

515
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,304
your friends have vanished,

516
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,223
and your family...

517
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,218
It'll be like...

518
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,854
Like you weren't ever born.

519
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,183
Because you turned into

520
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,610
the very thing that you swore
to protect them from.

521
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,995
Anyhoo...

522
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,584
Good luck with that.

523
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,674
<i>Mr. Slater?</i>

524
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,554
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

525
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,389
Ms. Horton,
are you ready to present your case?

526
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,276
The defense rests, Your Honor.

527
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,365
Should've gone
with the insanity plea.

528
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,739
Oh! Excuse me.

529
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,568
What's wrong?

530
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,454
What is going on?

531
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,302
There's a massive spike in radiation
downtown at Prentis and Rollins.

532
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,260
<i>The driver
of the nuclear waste truck.</i>

533
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,564
Radiation signature's
already at 3,000 rads and climbing.

534
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,733
We need to stop this guy
before it hits 10,000.

535
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,400
What happens at 10,000 rads?

536
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,065
Hiroshima.

537
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:09,954
Barry Allen has dedicated his life
in service of Central City.

538
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,995
He's helped
to solve countless crimes.

539
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:18,205
His testimony has led to the
conviction of dozens of criminals.

540
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,627
Barry Allen is a good man.

541
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,380
He's an innocent man.

542
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,090
And frankly,
Central City is lucky to have him.

543
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,647
Dare I say,
few men in this city are as honest,

544
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,854
upstanding and dependable.

545
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,603
Mr. Allen?

546
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,406
Your Honor, I...

547
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,607
I have to go.

548
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,079
Barry, what are you doing?

549
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,155
I have to.

550
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,794
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
this is an emergency.

551
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,870
Someone needs me.

552
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,002
And I need you
to respect my courtroom.

553
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,550
I will not stand
for theatrical disruptions.

554
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,467
Your Honor,
my client is still free on bail.

555
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,385
And there are no laws that require

556
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,011
him to be present
during closing statements.

557
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,395
Be advised, Mr. Allen,

558
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,724
you are required by law
to be here for sentencing.

559
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,818
Yes, Your Honor.

560
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,909
Stay where you are!

561
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,123
What is happening to me?

562
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,580
Hold it right there!

563
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,712
I didn't do anything!

564
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,557
<i>You need to stop.</i>

565
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,637
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

566
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,978
I understand,
but your radioactivity is dangerous.

567
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,822
<i>- Guys?</i>
- Seven thousand five hundred rads!

568
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,244
Barry, don't get too close to him,
all right?

569
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,663
The radiation he's emitting
is too hot to allow you to self-heal.

570
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,285
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

571
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,499
What am I supposed to do?
How do I stop him?

572
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,749
I can't stop this!

573
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,083
Damn!

574
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,418
We need to cool him down.

575
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,543
Killer Frost.

576
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,346
- Great.
- Well...

577
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,639
Go! Turn!

578
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,966
Well, that's not how it works.

579
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,097
I can't just snap my fingers
and make her appear.

580
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,723
It only happens
when I'm scared or angry.

581
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,680
- Oh, good Lord, Caitlin!
- Caitlin!

582
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,060
The city's about to explode!

583
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,483
Everyone! Everything you know
and love!

584
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,403
The birds, the trees, the fish,
the puppies!

585
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,898
Puppies are going down
because you didn't wanna

586
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,198
- show up for work!
- Show up for work!

587
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,819
Thanks.

588
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,993
- That was pretty good.
- Yeah, pretty good.

589
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,073
- Now go already!
- Okay!

590
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,701
Okay, there you go.

591
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,501
What's going on?
Is this business or a social call?

592
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,965
Business, I see.

593
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,444
- Is she okay?
- She's gonna be okay, yeah.

594
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,063
You have any more ideas?

595
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,863
What if I breach him?

596
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,738
Ramon, no, you... You drop him
in a breach, he could explode.

597
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,611
And Fallout's fallout
would kill us all.

598
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,695
Do you think?

599
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,282
Wait, what if I create a vacuum
around him?

600
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,163
That way, even if he does explode,
at least we contain the blast.

601
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,334
<i>Yes. Allen, yes.</i>

602
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,753
That could work.
That could contain it.

603
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,705
Whatever you're gonna do, though,
do it fast.

604
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,631
<i>Falloutjust went above 8,000 rads.</i>

605
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,265
- The vacuum's containing his energy.
<i>- Good.</i>

606
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,596
But he's still getting stronger.

607
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,192
<i>Allen, I don't know how long
you can take this much radiation.</i>

608
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,775
I don't have a choice.
We have to contain his energy.

609
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,276
Allen, 9,000 rads.

610
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,871
Ten thousand rads! Critical mass!

611
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,789
Ramon, you need
to send that energy somewhere.

612
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,866
What? To where?

613
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,123
Earth-15. Earth-15 is a dead Earth!
Breach it there now!

614
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,663
You did it.

615
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,085
Oh, man, you did it.

616
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,418
You saved the day.

617
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,802
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you've reached a verdict?

618
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,132
We have, Your Honor.

619
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,885
<i>All rise.</i>

620
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,691
For docket number 5677-B,

621
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,775
in the matter of <i>The People
v. Bartholomew Henry Allen,</i>

622
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,358
we, the jury,
find the defendant guilty

623
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,568
<i>of murder in the first degree.</i>

624
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,920
Thanks to your meta-metabolism,

625
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,176
your radiation burns should disappear
in the next few minutes.

626
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,923
What about Fallout?

627
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,761
He's unstable,
but we sent him to Tracy's lab.

628
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,390
She's gonna analyze his DNA,

629
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,891
see if it's the same
as the other metas

630
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,314
and be able to neutralize him.

631
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,564
<i>...Superior Court,</i>

632
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,644
<i>where minutes ago, the jury found
Bartholomew Henry Allen guilty</i>

633
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,855
<i>in the murder
of Professor Clifford DeVoe.</i>

634
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,191
<i>Mr. Allen has been a CSI with
the Central City Police Department</i>

635
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,651
<i>for the last five years.</i>

636
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,452
<i>In just a few short hours,</i>

637
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,326
<i>the judge is expected to announce
Mr. Allen's sentence.</i>

638
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,908
<i>Prosecutor Anton Slater
made a statement.</i>

639
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,994
<i>He hoped Mr. Allen
would receive a life sentence,</i>

640
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,999
<i>given the brutal nature of the crime.</i>

641
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,168
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

642
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,124
I can't believe this is happening.

643
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,177
Come on, guys,
we just saved the city today.

644
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,922
We knew this wasn't
gonna go my way in court.

645
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,552
That doesn't mean that DeVoe beat us.

646
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,475
Whatever happens,
we're gonna keep fighting.

647
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,722
I know.

648
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,720
<i>We need to get you back.</i>

649
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,472
You need to be there for sentencing.

650
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,562
Yeah.

651
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,188
I'll see you guys later, all right?

652
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,612
I'm gonna be okay, all right?

653
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,027
Come on.

654
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,327
You know, you got your strength
from watching your dad be your rock.

655
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,665
I got mine because...

656
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,464
You're mine.

657
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,297
And I'll be strong for you.

658
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,631
I love you.

659
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,097
I love you.

660
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,550
Come on.

661
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,096
Mr. Allen, are you going
to appeal the verdict...

662
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,271
Step back.

663
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,405
Hey, I need a minute, all right?

664
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,415
Mr. Allen...

665
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,039
DeVoe.

666
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,288
Did you know there was a 12% chance

667
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,339
that you were gonna tell the world
you're the Flash?

668
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,884
I'd recheck your math.

669
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,927
There's no need.

670
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,718
Because no matter
what path you chose,

671
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,845
all avenues led to my triumph.

672
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,892
Why do you want us distracted?

673
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,561
Why do you want me
out of the picture?

674
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,892
What are you planning?

675
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,268
That you think that you could

676
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,224
understand the breadth
of what I'm about to do

677
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,684
is almost humorous.

678
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,067
Yes, I think you will miss Iris.

679
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,407
That's right, Mr. Allen.

680
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,705
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

681
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,998
I took his ability.

682
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,002
I know what you're thinking,
right now.

683
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,500
I want you to hear me say it.

684
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,212
I'm gonna figure a way out of this.

685
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,548
And when I do,

686
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,724
I don't care
whose face you're wearing.

687
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,513
I'm coming for you.

688
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,720
You haven't beaten us yet.

689
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,435
Haven't I?

690
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,777
Have a nice life, Mr. Allen.

691
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,044
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

692
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,258
I didn't do this.
I didn't kill anyone.

693
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,589
And I know that one day
the truth will come out.

694
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,099
<i>Thank you.</i>

695
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,635
Rise for sentencing.

696
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,855
In my 30 years behind this bench

697
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,437
<i>I have seen my share of criminals.</i>

698
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,148
<i>But I confess, this defendant</i>

699
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,733
<i>stands apart.</i>

700
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,244
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

701
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,367
A few hours ago,

702
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,119
the very existence of our city

703
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,371
came under the threat
of nuclear destruction.

704
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,503
But one man rose
to meet that challenge.

705
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,048
The defendant
was in a position of authority.

706
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,883
Our city trusted him
to bring the guilty to justice.

707
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,222
He ran into danger,

708
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,138
knowing he would suffer
burns all over his body.

709
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,767
He used that trust to take
an innocent and vulnerable life.

710
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,849
This man was not thinking
about himself.

711
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,108
He was thinking about you,

712
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,981
the first responders
on the front lines...

713
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,031
Never have I seen
a defendant more unmoved.

714
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,609
Never have I seen a man
with more bravery.

715
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,615
Never have I seen such inhumanity.

716
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,991
Such heroism.

717
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,744
Such a lack of regard for human life.

718
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,825
<i>It is my great honor</i>

719
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,789
to present Central City
Police Department's Award of Valor

720
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,749
to this city's finest hero.

721
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,251
The fastest man alive...
The Flash!

722
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,425
<i>The court hereby orders
that Bartholomew Henry Allen</i>

723
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,511
should be incarcerated
for the rest of his natural life,

724
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,138
<i>without the possibility of parole.</i>

725
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,063
And that Mr. Allen
be immediately remanded

726
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,486
<i>to Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

727
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,822
And may God have mercy on your soul.

728
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,297
<i>Filthy cop!</i>

729
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,336
<i>Badge ain't gonna
help you now.</i>

730
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,088
<i>Be seeing you around, B.</i>

731
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,140
<i>Gonna break you, string bean.</i>

732
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,034
Get comfortable.

733
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:11,058
