00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,843
- That's because

178
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,843
it's not an alien pod.

179
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,845
It's a warhead from a Soviet

180
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,597
SS-4 medium-range

181
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,597
ballistic missile.

182
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,099
- Uh, Rory, where are we?

183
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,311
- Uh, some island

184
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,311
in the Caribbean.

185
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,521
- Wouldn't happen to be Cuba,

186
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,521
would it, Mick?

187
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,564
- Please tell me

188
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,564
you didn't take us to 1962.

189
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,108
- Why? What happened?

190
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,901
Oh.

191
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,901
- Oh.

192
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,528
- Rory, you just dropped us

193
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,528
in the middle

194
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,737
of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

195
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,323
- And helped us steal a nuke.

196
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,158
- So?

197
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,158
- So?!

198
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,993
This is the moment in history

199
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,993
when Americans and Soviets

200
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,161
came to the brink

201
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,161
of nuclear war.

202
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,578
If we so much as sneeze--

203
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,621
okay, nobody move.

204
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,747
It could be Armageddon.

205
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,333
- Okay, but we can still find

206
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,584
the alien that'll help us

207
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,584
find Sara.

208
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,919
- You remembered

209
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,919
to cloak the ship

210
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,463
before we left, right?

211
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,636
[phone rings]

212
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,139
- Yes.

213
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,891
I see.

214
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,267
Let him in.

215
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,769
- Mr. President.

216
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,479
- If this is about

217
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,479
the, uh, missiles

218
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,397
down in Cuba,

219
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,397
I've already been briefed.

220
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,399
- I'm afraid that the nukes

221
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,399
are the least of our problems.

222
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,651
These photographs were taken

223
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,696
on the latest U-2 pass

224
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,696
over Cuba.

225
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,447
- What the hell is that?

226
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,657
- Mr. President,

227
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,657
it would appear

228
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,326
that the Soviets

229
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,326
have a new bomber.

230
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,120
[tense music]

231
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,208
- Gideon,

232
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,208
what's the latest in D.C.?

233
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,625
- JFK just called

234
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,625
for an emergency meeting

235
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,378
of his top advisors.

236
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,255
- Damn it, that's what I get

237
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,255
for letting Rory run point

238
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,339
in the middle of the Cold War.

239
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,924
- It's all good.

240
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,924
- Is it?

241
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,093
- JFK delivered a masterclass

242
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,093
in diplomacy

243
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,594
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

244
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,054
How do I know this?

245
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,722
Because I wrote

246
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,722
my doctoral thesis on it.

247
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,057
- You wanna go to Washington.

248
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,600
- [as JFK]

249
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,600
With your permission, Captain,

250
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,893
I would love to throw the ball--

251
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,353
- No. No. Lose the accent.

252
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,854
Way to wear that suit, though.

253
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,854
- Thank you.

254
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,232
- Aw. Thanks, girl.

255
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,775
- What happened to your totem?

256
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,568
- Oh, old one clashed.

257
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,279
- I take it you wanna go

258
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,279
to Washington too.

259
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,738
- Yes, I spent

260
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,738
a lot of time on this.

261
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,865
- Ah, morning, team.

262
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,865
What'd I miss?

263
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,409
- Nate and Zari

264
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,409
are gonna make sure

265
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,077
that JFK doesn't start

266
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,077
World War III.

267
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,245
The rest of us are chasing down

268
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,495
a displaced space alien in Cuba.

269
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
No big deal.

270
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
- Cool. I'll just be--

271
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,125
- Ah, you will just be with me.

272
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,125
Let's go.

273
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,501
Come on.

274
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,501
- [groaning]

275
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,463
- [whispering]

276
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,463
We're gonna go see the Kennedys!

277
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,216
- Good news, Captain.

278
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,216
We found the pod.

279
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,926
- It's currently on its way

280
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,926
to Fidel Castro's

281
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,428
not-so-secret bunker.

282
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
- Wow, you found the alien

283
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
using your powers?

284
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,390
- Nah. CB radio.

285
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,683
- [soldier speaking Spanish]

286
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,935
- De nada, Capitan.

287
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,979
- Mm-hmm. Right.

288
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,274
Easiest way in is here.

289
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,274
I'm guessing four guards.

290
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,693
We just blow the place to smi--

291
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,693
- Okay, I'll take it from here.

292
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,779
- They're not gonna let you just

293
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,779
walk through the front door.

294
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,697
- That's exactly

295
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,697
what they're gonna do.

296
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,450
Let's go. Behrad, come with me.

297
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,827
- Why do you keep grabbing me?

298
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,827
Look, Captain.

299
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,996
Authoritarian leaders,

300
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,996
secret bunkers,

301
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,831
nuclear missiles, I'm just not

302
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,499
feeling the energy

303
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,499
of this mission.

304
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,126
- Too bad, because I need

305
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,126
your energy, okay?

306
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,627
Can't afford any hotheads

307
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,627
starting a nuclear war.

308
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,087
- Hey, I'm just trying

309
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,087
to help you

310
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,797
find your girlfriend.

311
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,382
- You know what you can

312
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,382
help me do is get the missile

313
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,633
back to the people

314
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,633
that we stole it from.

315
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,010
- Wait, the Russians?

316
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
- That defeats the purpose

317
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
of stealing.

318
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,305
- Our job is to protect history.

319
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,015
Remember that next time.

320
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,895
[soldiers shouting]

321
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,440
- Oye, oye.

322
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,440
Where do you think you're going?

323
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,233
- Sorry, brother,

324
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,233
we just got turned around.

325
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,486
Is there another entrance

326
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,486
we can maybe try?

327
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,238
- Who is your companion?

328
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,238
- Oh, uh, she's--

329
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,573
- [in Russian accent]

330
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,573
I am Dr. Yevgania Shostenko.

331
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,242
At ease, comrade.

332
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,618
- Who are you here to see?

333
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,205
- Um, that's classified?

334
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,165
[suspenseful music]

335
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,749
It's cool.

336
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,749
We can come back later.

337
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,503
- Oh, no, please.

338
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,503
We enter now. It's--

339
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,754
- What kind of doctor are you?

340
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,174
- Em...

341
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,259
[clears throat]

342
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,847
The kind who specializes

343
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,847
in extraterrestrial creatures.

344
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,101
- Why didn't you say so?

345
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,020
Follow me.

346
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,404
- We're supposed to give

347
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,404
the nuke to the Russkies, right?

348
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,073
Well, those ain't Russkies.

349
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,242
