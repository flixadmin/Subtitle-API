00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,666
[announcer] It has now been seven months

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,041
since Spain
began applying European measures

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,708
to tackle the shortage of basic resources.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,416
The plan, called ''Not Enough for All,"

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,083
has started to produce results.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,125
But for now, Spain,
as well as its neighboring countries,

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,916
won't be able
to sustain dependent citizens until--

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
[radio shuts off]

12
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,375
Get to your positions.
Come on. Same as last time.

13
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,875
-Let's do this.
-[man 1] Let's go.

14
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,916
Meet back at the trucks. Be careful, okay?

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,333
-Let's go. Quickly and quietly.
-Run fast.

16
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:48,166
[man 2] Bring your things. Hurry. Come on.
Come on. Move it. Move it. Go, go, go.

17
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,791
-Come on. Come on, quickly.
-Come on, Mia. Let's go.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,833
-[man 2] Hurry up. Quickly.
-Where?

19
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,833
[man 3] This way.

20
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,916
[whispered chatter]

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,666
Move it. Move it.

22
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,375
You two, follow me.
This way, guys. Come on!

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,833
This way.

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,166
-Faster.
-[man 4 speaking Spanish]

25
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,666
[man 2] Faster. Move it.

26
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,916
-[woman breathing heavily]
-[man 2] Come on. Let's go.

27
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,500
-You okay?
-[Mia] No.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,166
Don't stop. Let's go.

00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,041

00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,500
[barking]

31
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,625
That way.
Let's go. Come on. Move. You first.

32
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,125
-Okay.
-[dogs continue barking]

33
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,541

-[Mia] Nico.
-[Nico] I'm here.

37
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,875
-I don't fit. Fuck, I don't fit!
-[Nico] You can do it.

38
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:54,875
-Push me.
-[Nico] Okay.

39
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,500
-[Mia struggles]
-[Nico] Sorry.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,875
-Are you okay? Yeah, you're okay.
-[Mia] What?

41
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,875
-[helicopter rumbles]
-[man 2] Back up!

42
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,791
Let's go.

43
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,458
Come on. Follow me.

44
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,708
Hold my hand.

45
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,125
Come on.

46
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,333
[Nico] Let's go, love.

47
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
[man 2] Stay back, don't move.

48
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,500
Now!

49
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,041
Through here. Almost there.

50
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,416
[man 5 over megaphone]
Attention! Put your hands in the air!

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,083
-Stay where you are.
-[woman whimpers]

52
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,458
This is the police. You are under arrest.

53
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,500
Give me the money.

54
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,875
You wait here.

55
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,958
-Are you okay?
-[Mia] Okay.

56
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,791
[exhales]

57
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,208
Didn't tell me about these two.
Bring 'em over.

58
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,250
You, here.

59
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,083
It's fine.

60
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,625
-Is anything wrong?
-The conditions are riskier than expected.

61
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
I need more money.

62
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,958
No, no, no. We don't have any more money.

63
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,833
I see how this works.

64
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,375
-Babe, give me your ring.
-[Mia] No.

65
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,416
-Yes. You've got to.
-No. We gave them everything. Not my ring!

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,458
Mia, we've got to leave now.

67
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,416
Take it.

68
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:14,916
Come on.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,125
Come on. We don't have all night. Move it.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,958
Good. This way.

71
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,375
Safe travels.

72
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,875
[Nico] We're gonna make it.

73
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,083
There it is. Our luxury liner.

74
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,041
Move it, asshole!

75
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,166
-Come on.
-[man 6] Let's go!

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,125
[man 7] Now!

77
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,208
[music swells]

78
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,000
[man 8] Step to the back.

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
-Are you okay?
-No.

80
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,250
[music crescendos and fades]

81
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,083
[flashlight clicks]

82
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,125
[woman 1] There's no food!

83
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,250
[man 1] We accepted
the discourse about shortages.

84
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,125
We accepted that we had to make sacrifices
for the common good.

85
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,666
We accepted
that measures would be temporary.

86
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,000
But what now?

87
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,958
Look how far they've pushed us.

88
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,083
First, they exterminated the elderly
to deal with the shortages.

89
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,541
Now they're targeting
pregnant women and kids.

90
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,583
Don't you see it? Pregnant women and kids!

91
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,708
The regime isn't ending shortages.

92
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,375
Is there anything else on?

93
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,625
[man 1] There are alternatives
to this massacre.

94
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,625
Countries like Ireland,
Iceland, and Norway have managed to stop…

95
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,541
-[Nico] Yeah, take it off.
-[Mia] Okay.

96
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,875
[man 1] Our country
must follow their example and help…

97
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,375
[Mia sighs]

98
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,708
[Nico] Let me see.

99
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,458
Wow. [chuckles]

100
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,666
That's better.

101
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,083
-Okay? Here.
-Yeah.

102
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,291
[baby cries]

103
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,541
[woman 2] Make him shut up.

104
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,916
[shushes]

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,125
[Mia] Where'd you get this?

106
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,041
Ah…

107
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,083
[Mia] Tell me.

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,708
It's a secret.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,583
Let's not have it now.

110
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,875
Let's save it
and eat it when we get there.

111
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,875
-To celebrate, right?
-Exactly.

112
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,666
[Nico sighs]

113
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,125
Do you think the regime will go there too?

114
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,166
Ireland has ruled in opposition to it.

115
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,250
Doesn't matter.
Governments are falling everywhere.

116
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
-I'll tell you something about the Irish.
-What?

117
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,958
It's impossible to overthrow them.

118
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,333
-They drink dark beer.
-Right.

119
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,875
Ireland won't give in.

120
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
You're allowed to be afraid, you know.

121
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,625
Everything will work out, you'll see. Hmm.

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,583
-You don't know for sure.
-The worst part is over.

123
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,708
You don't know that.

124
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,833
There's one thing I do know.

125
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:55,958
[Mia] What?

126
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,666
That I love you more than yesterday.

127
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,958
But less than tomorrow.

128
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,500
[drilling sounds]

129
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,833
[truck engine revving]

130
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,250
What's happening? Are we there?

131
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,958
-[brakes hiss]
-[truck engine revving]

132
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:28,958
We're leaving.

133
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,750
-[phone beeps]
-[woman 2] Turn off the games.

134
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,333
[whispers] Do you think she's pregnant?
She's all alone.

135
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,875
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

136
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,375
How's our little Noa doing?

137
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,208
I didn't know we decided yet.

138
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,375
-Noa.
-[sighs]

139
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,083
-What do you wanna name her?
-I hope it isn't a girl.

140
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,708
I mean it.

141
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,166
Well, I think she's a girl, a warrior.

142
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,416
Just like her mother.

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,375
I don't feel her.

144
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,666
What?

145
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,666
She hasn't kicked me in two days.

146
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,208
[sighs] That's not good.

147
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,083
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,833
Dunno.

149
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,416
What are you doing?

150
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,208
Haven't you noticed?

151
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,250
She always pushes right here.

152
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,625
I think this is a foot.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,916
How do you do it?

154
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,625
What?

155
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,875
Act like everything's fine.

156
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,875
Like nothing's happened to us.

157
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,708
You know that's not true.

158
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,208
-You know, don't you?
-Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,875
[baby cries]

160
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,541
[squeaking sound]

161
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,208
[girl] You brought my duck!

162
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,583
Hi, there. What's wrong?

163
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,750
[women 3 shushes]

164
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,333
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

165
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
No, no, no. Don't cry.

166
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,125
-[man 2] What does the duck say?
-[woman 3] Shh. Don't cry. You're okay.

167
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,541
-Shh.
-Nico.

168
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,458
[Nico] Yeah?

169
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,000
What if she's alive,

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
and we're leaving her behind?

171
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,041
All alone.

172
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,166
She's not alive.

173
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,416
They took her away,

174
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,666
and they killed her.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,833
[Mia] Hmm.

Get off the truck.

No, no.
I can't do it alone, I really can't.

Listen to me. You can't trust anyone.
Understand? Keep your things tucked away.

Nico, listen to me.

223
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,541
Are you sure they're taking us
to the same location?

224
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,666
Yes, and when they stop, I'll escape.

225
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,791
Our ship is the only one
setting sail this week.

You can't tell me what you're moving?

Am I clear?

You in a rush?

287
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,208
Uh, it's just if-- if I'm late,
I'll be penalized.

288
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,916
Well, I'm required
to check inside the truck.

289
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,208
But is that necessary?
I'm barely carrying anything.

290

Well done.

303
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,541
You can come out now.

304
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.

[baby fussing]

306
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,958
[cop 1] You won't come out?

307
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,875
I know that the austerity measures
have been cruel.

308
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,458
They're especially hard
on women and children.

309
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,666
I understand
if you don't think you can trust me.

310
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,416
It's hard to know
who to trust, right? Hmm?

311
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
Not those who forced you
into this container.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,250
They stuffed you in here
with barely enough air to breathe

313
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,708
and robbed you
of all the money you had left.

314
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,083
And they promised you…

00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,083
[chuckles]

316
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,041
…you could have a better life
in a better place.

317
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,208
They lied.

318
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,041
A better place doesn't exist.

319
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,291
So you should come out.

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,208
Because if you don't, I'll have to shoot.

321
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,833
Damn it. Don't make me give that order.
I've had to give it so many times.

322
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,083
I can save your lives.

540
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,875
The driver fucked us over.
He left us outside the city limits.

541
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,375
It'll take a few days to catch up.

542
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,500
No. Listen to me.
Something's happening to me, Nico.

543
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,333
-What's wrong?
-I'm trapped in here and I can't get out.

544
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,583
I'm coming to you.
I'm coming. I'll be there soon.

545
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:37,041
No, no, no. You've gotta listen to me.
I'm not… You won't…

546
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,333
What? What's going on?

547
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,583
I'm not on the boat.

548
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,625
-What do you mean?
-I'm not on the boat.

549
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,625
-My container's in the ocean.
-Wait. Your-- What? Where are you?

550
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,750
I don't know. I'm floating in the ocean.
I'm drifting. I don't know where.

551
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,875
I'm okay for now,
but the water's seeping in.

552
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,333
Oh my God, Mia.
Can you see anything outside?

553
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,791
Yes, I can see, but all there is is water.
There's just water.

554
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,625
-There's nothing else?
-Nothing. Just water.

555
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,833
-I'm in the middle of the ocean, Nico.
-Fuck!

556
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,500
Say something. I'm scared.

557
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,125
Just don't worry, Mia.
I'll rescue you. I promise.

558
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,916
-Nico…
-Just try to hang in there.

559
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,208
-I'm trying, but I…
-Do it for the baby.

560
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,250
I don't think I can do this much longer.

561
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,208
-You can do it.
-I just miss her so much, Nico.

562
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,375
No, no, no, no. No, no.

563
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,208
-My love, don't do this. Not now.
-I messed up again.

564
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,083
It's not your fault. Do you understand?

565
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,750
What happened to Uma was not your fault.

566
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,041
-Sweetheart.
-It wasn't?

567
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,833
You're the strongest person
I've ever known.

568
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,708
-Promise you won't give up?
-Yes.

569
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,791
-Mia…
-Yeah?

570
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,250
I love you more than yesterday.

571
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,625
But less than tomorrow.

572
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:42,458
I will call you
as soon as I figure out a plan.
