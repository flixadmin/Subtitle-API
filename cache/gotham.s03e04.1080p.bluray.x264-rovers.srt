1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,718
- Previously on Gotham...
- Listen to the watch.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,447
It's ticking. Synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

3
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:09,496
Stand upon the back of the chair.

4
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,848
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,017
I want you to find my sister.

6
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,354
Her condition, some poison in her blood.

7
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:19,489
I announce my candidacy for mayor.

8
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,993
Hugo Strange made another you.

9
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,077
- He's gone.
- He cut his hair.

10
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,579
To look more like you.

11
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,147
Does Alfred know you have his car?

12
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:29,115
Would you like to go for a ride?

13
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:32,285
The ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

14
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:34,921
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

15
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:36,039
Step off the ledge.

16
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,424
Stop!

17
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,465
You don't understand.

18
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:49,386
My-my brother will find out I'm
here, and he'll come for me.

19
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:50,887
Nothing will stop him.

20
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:52,806
This is the brother
that took you to Strange

21
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:53,974
to try and fix you?

22
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:55,525
What? No.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,144
Jervis kept me a
prisoner most of my life,

24
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:00,530
and when I finally managed to escape,

25
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:02,699
I ran as far away from him as I could.

26
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,067
Mm-hmm, and landed in Gotham.

27
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,070
It seemed like a good place to hide.

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,373
Until Strange found me and
locked me in Indian Hill.

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,793
I'll admit, not the best luck
for you or your future landlord.

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,662
That was an accident.

31
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,248
The infecting part or the
lighting him on fire part?

32
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,216
I'm not a monster!

33
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:22,669
But if you want to see one,

34
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,739
just wait until my brother comes for me.

35
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,292
You don't know what he's capable of.

36
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:33,229
This isn't over.

37
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,634
For either of us.

38
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:44,441
It's perfect!

39
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:46,609
Oh, my sister used to
love amusement parks.

40
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:50,246
The rides, the food, the
tents with amazing acts.

41
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,666
That's why I became a performer.

42
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,018
Are you a family man?

43
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,536
Yes.

44
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:58,204
I am a family man.

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,711
The day I lost her was
the saddest of my life.

46
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:07,597
The only thing that got me through,

47
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:10,216
that kept me sane,

48
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:13,436
was the hope of one day
being together again.

49
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,090
Reunited.

50
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,542
And if all goes well,

51
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:23,229
that day is today.

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,705
Of course, a reunion like this

53
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,441
needs to be a private affair.

54
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:36,326
You understand.

55

56
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:47,504
It's Election Day in Gotham,
with former mayor Aubrey James

57
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,724
and former criminal
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

58
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,058
running toe to toe...

59
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:53,560
Why don't you take care of it.

60
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:55,061
Appreciate it.

61
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:56,179
Thank you.

62
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,267
I must say, you are looking

63
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:02,986
quite the dapper fellow.

64
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,356
I had to guess on the jacket size.

65
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:09,626
- I hope it fits.
- Perfectly.

66
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:11,111
I cannot thank you enough.

67
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:12,479
It's just a suit.

68
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,330
No. No, if it weren't for you,

69
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,817
I would still be falling asleep
to the screams of the insane.

70
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:20,336
It becomes almost a white noise
after a while, doesn't it?

71
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,755
It does.

72
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,124
I do believe, Oswald,

73
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:27,894
Arkham has made us both stronger.

74
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,381
I couldn't agree more.

75
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:34,684
Which is why I had

76
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,052
our release certificates framed.

77
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:38,888
A reminder of past struggles

78
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,224
and new beginnings.

79
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:42,692
If I didn't know better,

80
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,527
I'd accuse you of
being a sentimentalist.

81
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,062
Guilty.

82
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,566
You all set, boss? Busy day today.

83
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:51,201
Who were those people
you were speaking with?

84
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,487
Don't worry about it.

85
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,122
Come now, Butch. Play nice.

86
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,205
We're all on the same team here.

87
00:03:58,243 --> 00:03:59,909
Right?

88
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,878
My team.

89
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,413
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:04,581
Whatever you say.

91
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:09,052
You keep your nose out of my business.

92
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,420
Yeah.

93
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:11,504
Sure.

94
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,724
Whatever you say.

95
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,851
Why is it that every time

96
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,269
something hits the fan around here,

97
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,571
I inevitably find you
at the center of it?

98
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:29,889
I was just working a job.

99
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,407
Her brother asked me to find her.

100
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,693
Yeah. You're some sort
of P.I. now? Is that it?

101
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,778
I'm whatever pays the bills. Great.

102
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,931
What do we know about this girl's blood?

103
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,667
Not much. She claims infecting
the landlord was an accident.

104
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,368
Have Thompkins draw some samples,

105
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,454
see if she can find out what
we're dealing with here.

106
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:45,839
And pick up the brother for questioning.

107
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:48,541
Any idea where we might find him?

108
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,793
No. But when I do, I'll let you know.

109
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,212
We have some unfinished business.

110
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:53,179
Not anymore.

111
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,797
This is an active investigation.

112
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,100
You go anywhere near him,
I'll have you arrested.

113
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,968
For what?

114
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,971
No law against two private
citizens having a chat.

115
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:06,588
I'll come by later to pick up my check.

116
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,099
I bet I'd make a kick-ass P.I.

117
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,951
Get out.

118
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,497
Have you had this condition since birth?

119
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,738
Tell me about it.

120
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,670
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

121
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,121
it changes them.

122
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,544
It affects every person differently.

123
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:43,446
My brother believes it brings
out a person's true nature.

124
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,616
Is your brother infected?

125
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:49,285
Is that why you're so terrified of him?

126
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,321
Jervis isn't infected.

127
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:54,607
He believes we're connected.

128
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:57,410
Two sides of the same coin.

129
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,864
My way is the blood, and his, the mind.

130
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,883
Hypnosis.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,453
It goes way beyond that.

132
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,506
He preys on fear,

133
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,842
anger, regret.

134
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:15,862
And if he gets in your mind...

135
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:19,999
you're doomed.

136
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:25,271
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,

137
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,140
your next mayor of Gotham!
Vote for Cobblepot.

138
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,559
Here you go. Cobblepot for mayor.

139
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:33,313
And Make Gotham Safe Again!

140
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,569
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,
your next mayor of Gotham!

141
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:45,074
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

142
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,660
Do you hear my watch ticking?

143
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:57,086
Hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

144
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,554
Listen closer.

145
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,845
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

146
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:07,897
Now you can rest, Jim.

147
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,779
Hey, pal!

148
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,616
You got a death wish or something?

149
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:35,632
Right, yes. Well, will
do. Thank you very much.

150
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,833
Good-bye.

151
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:40,503
Well, that was the impound
yard from downtown.

152
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:41,904
It appears the Rolls

153
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,973
was towed only this
morning, Master Bruce.

154
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,175
This doesn't make any sense.

155
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,845
- Why would he leave?
- Well, he cut his hair

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,764
to look more like you,
if that's even possible.

157
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,182
You think he went to the
city to pretend to be me.

158
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,386
- Yeah, absolutely. Bloody yes.
- So where would he go?

159
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,855
Take in a show, do a little
bit of shopping, have a facial?

160
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,357
I mean, where do pain-resistant clones

161
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,476
of multibillionaire
teenagers normally go?

162
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,428
- Alfred.
- Well, I don't know.

163
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,864
The car was found at 11th
and Dillon, wasn't it?

164
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,332
That's in the Narrows.

165
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:12,771
So I suppose we should be thankful
there's anything left to tow.

166
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,542
What in the dickens was he doing
down there in the first place?

167
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,679
Selina.

168
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:28,217
11th and Dillon is near her apartment.

169
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,719
Sorry, again, for the way I acted

170
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,354
when you came by yesterday.

171
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:32,772
Any word on your friend Ivy?

172
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,474
No.

173
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,442
I even braved a beat-down
from Sonny to see

174
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:39,271
if she was growing magic
mushrooms for him again.

175
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:41,864
- Magic what?
- Mushrooms.

176
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Sonny Gilzean.

177
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,536
Pounded you to within
an inch of your life.

178
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,738
Yeah. Sonny, right.

179
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,707
Well, this is it.

180
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:52,992
Time to earn a living.

181
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,577
- You work here?
- No.

182
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,079
I rob here.

183
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,380
What?

184
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,215
The Bang Bang Room is a betting parlor.

185
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
Should be flush today
with the mayor's race.

186
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,586
Meet me around back in five minutes.

187
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:06,861
Selina.

188
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,226
Yeah! Pay up!

189
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,023
Hey, that guy at the end of the bar

190
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,741
said you're buying the place a round.

191
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:24,609
What?

192
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,278
Mm-hmm. Oh, and your mom sucks.

193
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,530
Or something.

194
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,282
Really?

195
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,122
Hey, wise guy!

196
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,540
Here's your drink!

197
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,464
Get him off me! That's enough!

198
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,814
Who the hell are you?

199
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,733
Sorry.

200
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:06,901
My first day.

201
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,152
Uh...

202
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,870
can you help me find the cherries?

203
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:11,322
No?

204
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,541
Probably behind the bar. Right.

205
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:14,659
Uh, I'll go check.

206
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,410
Hey, Squirrel,

207
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,646
what's the odds of a
person getting out of here

208
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,981
in one piece?

209
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,499
Not good, boss.

210
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:29,557
My beloved mother

211
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:31,892
always believed in me.

212
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:36,530
Even when I doubted
myself, she held firm.

213
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,986
Seeing all of your bright
faces reminds me that

214
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:46,941
there is nothing you cannot
do if you put your mind to it.

215
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:51,779
And when I am mayor, I believe...

216
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:56,534
no... I know that together,

217
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:59,453
we will Make Gotham Safe Again!

218
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,296
Excuse me.

219
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:10,848
Are you on the election board?

220
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,383
Yeah.

221
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:13,768
I work for Mr. Cobblepot.

222
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,220
He just wanted me to confirm
what Butch gave you. May I?

223
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,722
Thank you.

224
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,561
It's all there.

225
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:24,562
Thank you.

226
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,817
Follow him for the rest of the day.

227
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,986
Don't let him leave your sight.

228
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,129
Well, look who's back.

229
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,966
I saw you last night.

230
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,085
You didn't even say hi. Rude.

231
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:50,788
- I need to find Jervis Tetch.
- Oh, you mean

232
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,841
"The Great Jervis Tetch,
Hypnotist Extraordinaire"?

233
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:57,061
You believe it actually says
that on his business card?

234
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:58,846
Number's been disconnected. Where is he?

235
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,264
I don't know.

236
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,932
Magic shop, bunny farm...

237
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:04,902
Someplace where everyone
wears top hats and drinks tea?

238
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,520
Barbara.

239
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,773
You know, I'm not sure
I like this new thing

240
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,242
of you storming in here every time

241
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,276
you need something.

242
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,111
It's almost like we're married.

243
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:15,112
Scary thought.

244
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,452
I need a favor.

245
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:23,704
Oh...

246
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:27,875
Then you must be monumentally screwed.

247
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:31,712
What happened? Did he hypnotize you?

248
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,964
Make you bark like a dog?

249
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:36,300
He's dangerous, Barbara.

250
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,803
Don't say I didn't warn you.

251
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,555
Okay.

252
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,394
He came in here earlier.

253
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,446
Said he wanted to hire some muscle.

254
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,281
- Muscle?
- Yeah.

255
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,399
For some performance he's planning.

256
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,267
Said he needed them to have flair.

257
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:54,485
What'd you tell him?

258
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,570
It's Gotham, baby.

259
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:59,790
We've all got flair.

260
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,992
Thanks.

261
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,662
Always a help.

262
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,163
Ugh!

263
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,351
Excellent!

264
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:33,023
Deever and Dumfree, I presume.

265
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,692
The Terrible Tweeds.

266
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:37,528
Your reputation precedes you.

267
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,363
And you are?

268
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,198
Jervis Tetch.

269
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,002
I have a job that might
suit your particular skills.

270
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,872
My sister's been taken by the GCPD.

271
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,458
I need to get her back.

272
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,713
You want to break
someone out of the GCPD?

273
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,314
Not "someone."

274
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,300
My sister.

275
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:03,020
I assumed men like yourselves
understood the bond

276
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,522
of family.

277
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,559
What's in it for us?

278
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,978
Does he... ever speak?

279
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,399
Regardless, if you'll do the courtesy

280
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,069
of listening to me, I think you'll find

281
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,405
I can be quite persuasive.

282
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:34,453
Place is packed to the gills.

283
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:37,306
It's running two to one, for Penguin.

284
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:39,408
Mm. Sounds like you're busy.

285
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,552
Maybe I should go, huh?

286
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,220
No. This won't take long.

287
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,055
I hate people with sticky fingers.

288
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:47,061
Okay, wait.

289
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:48,490
W-What do you... what do you need?

290
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,493
Huh? Money? Information?

291
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,244
I could be useful.

292
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:55,547
Oh, you will be.

293
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:57,082
You'll send a message.

294
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,168
But maybe...

295
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,470
I don't got to do this.

296
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,105
I mean, maybe...

297
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,174
you learned your lesson.

298
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:07,642
Yeah, totally. I...

299
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,146
You're screwing with me, aren't you?

300
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,263
Yeah.

301
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,848
Do it.

302
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,329
Bruce?

303
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,143
Let's go.

304
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:03,398
And although some have
criticized Mr. Cobblepot

305
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,234
for running a campaign based
largely on name-calling

306
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,569
and fear-mongering...

307
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:09,538
His simple message of

308
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,540
"Make Gotham Safe Again" has...

309
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:14,075
Can you believe Penguin
might win this thing?

310
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,744
Whole city's going to hell

311
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:16,912
in a handbasket.

312
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:20,215
You okay?

313
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,000
Fine.

314
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,385
I assume

315
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,554
you didn't come here
to ask about my health.

316
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:29,090
I need to speak with Alice Tetch.

317
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,508
No.

318
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,960
Five minutes, that's all I'm asking.

319
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,862
She's scheduled to be moved
to a facility upstate.

320
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,263
I'm sure she'll have
plenty of time then.

321
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,648
This can't wait.

322
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:38,867
What's going on?

323
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,356
You can talk to me, son.

324
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,042
Her brother.

325
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:49,110
I had a run-in with him last night.

326
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:52,030
Think he may have done something to me.

327
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:53,531
Like what?

328
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:54,950
I don't know.

329
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,237
I'm having thoughts.

330
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,708
Look...

331
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,310
you've caught some bad breaks.

332
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,479
Blackgate. Lee.

333
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,431
I don't know what happened
when you went to see her,

334
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,966
but I can take a pretty good guess.

335
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,086
But at some point, you're
gonna have to make peace

336
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,405
with the decisions you've made.

337
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,574
And what if I can't?

338
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,778
Take it from me,

339
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:26,031
you don't want to wake
up one day and realize

340
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,733
that 20 years has gone by.

341
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,989
We're keeping Alice in interrogation.

342
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,991
Five minutes.

343
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:45,333
What was that back there?

344
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:47,419
- What?
- You.

345
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:51,339
Remind me to give props
to Alfred on his training.

346
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:53,892
I did not think you had that in you.

347
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,977
Me neither.

348
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,262
You okay?

349
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,763
You?

350
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:00,849
A little lightheaded.

351
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,403
Bruce.

352
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:07,188
- Oh... You need a hospital.
- No.

353
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,773
No hospitals.

354
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:13,528
- Are those scars?
- Nothing, they're nothing.

355
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,280
You're not Bruce.

356
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:16,865
Selina, just...

357
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,783
- You're not Bruce.
- Just-just listen...

358
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,369
- What the hell are you?!
- I won't hurt you. Just let me...

359
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,588
Just let me explain.

360
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:30,211
I assume you know Butch is
paying campaign officials

361
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,212
to buy the election?

362
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:32,714
You don't approve?

363
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,350
My dear Ed, this is Gotham.

364
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,768
This is how things are done.

365
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:38,603
And in theory, I support that.

366
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,055
But, Oswald,

367
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:42,941
Do you see how these people
are cheering for you?

368
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:46,061
Yes, they... do seem very excited.

369
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:48,396
You can win this on your own.

370
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:51,149
Why risk it? There is no upside.

371
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,485
I want this, Ed. I want this
like I've never wanted anything.

372
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:54,736
I know.

373
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:57,989
Which is why you need to call off Butch.

374
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,328
Mr. Penguin?

375
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,796
Hello, there.

376
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,133
I wanted to thank you for
getting rid of all the monsters.

377
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:14,222
Do you see?

378
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:16,257
People look at me differently now.

379
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,593
For the first time in my life,

380
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:19,978
I feel wanted.

381
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,679
Nice doing business with you.

382
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:30,688
And how do you feel now?

383
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,157
I feel like I've misjudged someone

384
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,658
who was supposed to be my friend.

385
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,110
I am your friend.

386
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:38,196
I can't be bought, but I
can be stolen with a glance.

387
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,165
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

388
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,950
- What am I?
- I don't care.

389
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:44,452
I do not need a stupid riddle right now.

390
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:46,955
I know what I want.

391
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,290
I want to be mayor.

392
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,092
Stay out of it, Ed.

393
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,128
I'm warning you.

394
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,801
I need to find your brother.

395
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:03,888
You turn me in, and
now you want my help.

396
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,058
I was hoping we could help each other.

397
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,979
He's still in your head, isn't he?

398
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:19,537
How do I stop it?

399
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:20,638
I don't know.

400
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:21,873
Most of the time,

401
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:24,159
once the trance is broken, that's it.

402
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,210
You should've been fine

403
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:26,327
the moment you stepped off the ledge.

404
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,829
Then why is it still happening?

405
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:31,332
Jervis has tapped into something
you're struggling with.

406
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:33,751
Something a part of
you would do anything

407
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,386
not to face.

408
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,839
Then give me something to
fight this until I find him.

409
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:41,192
There's usually a trigger that
brings on the hypnotic state.

410
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:43,178
What's the last thing you remember?

411
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,014
He pulled out his watch.

412
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,532
Asked if I could hear it ticking.

413
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,983
That's it, then.

414
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,401
His watch.

415
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:53,938
Anything resembling the ticking
will trigger the impulse.

416
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:57,809
He's made you a prisoner
in your own skin.

417
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,946
He did it to you.

418
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:03,998
When we were kids.

419
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:09,904
At first, he did it to control me.

420
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,240
Keep me with him.

421
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:13,558
But then he started

422
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,828
putting other thoughts in my head.

423
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,264
Thoughts a...

424
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,133
Thoughts a brother should never have.

425
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:26,888
That's why I wanted to kill him.

426
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:31,309
I won't go back to him.

427
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:34,979
Not ever.

428
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,793
Yeah!

429
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:50,295
Everybody!

430
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,131
Come on! Huh?

431
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,016
Ladies and gentlemen!

432
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,751
It is with great excitement

433
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:58,052
that we welcome you to our show.

434
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,587
It's him.

435
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,256
He's come for me.

436
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,924
Getting you out of here.

437
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:04,592
To wrestling's most notorious family,

438
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:08,346
here to entertain and amaze!

439
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:09,931
The Terrible Tweeds.

440
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,533
Let the show begin!

441
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,115
Harvey, look out behind you!

442
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:37,709
Hello, sis.

443
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,962
We both know you can't kill me.

444
00:22:41,014 --> 00:22:43,581
Not until I remove that nagging

445
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:45,800
little impulse I planted.

446
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:47,802
Turn around, hands in the air.

447
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,816
Alice, go.

448
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:03,735
Now.

449
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:05,820
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

450
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:07,238
No!

451
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,324
I doubt I'll be seeing you again.

452
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:11,459
Get off me! Let go!

453
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:13,244
Mr. Gordon!

454
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,044
Ugh.

455
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:27,277
It really doesn't hurt?

456
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:29,385
No.

457
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,366
Whatever they did to me at
Indian Hill, I don't feel pain.

458
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:36,079
So why'd they make a Bruce
Wayne look-alike anyhow?

459
00:23:36,188 --> 00:23:37,074
I don't know.

460
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,443
I didn't even know I looked
like him until a few days ago.

461
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:42,029
I went to his house thinking
he might have some answers

462
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,031
about who I am.

463
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,082
He didn't.

464
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:47,034
So you ran off and pretended to be him.

465
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,970
Why?

466
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,005
You'll laugh.

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,089
I doubt it.

468
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,492
Neither of you has a sense of humor.

469
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,210
When you came to see
him the other night,

470
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,462
I was watching from the hall.

471
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,431
I saw the way you looked at him.

472
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,300
No one's ever looked at me like that.

473
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:05,553
I wanted to know how it felt.

474
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:07,304
You should have your eyes checked.

475
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,974
I didn't look at him like anything.

476
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,126
All I mean is that I've
never had a friend.

477
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:15,613
I've never had anyone.

478
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:19,784
You have no idea what it's like
to spend your whole life alone.

479
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,653
You're actually better off.

480
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:24,338
People are overrated.

481
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,073
You don't believe that.

482
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,143
My mom left before I could ride a bike.

483
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,711
Never knew my dad.

484
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:31,829
I had two friends.

485
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:33,631
One ended up barbecued,

486
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,783
and the other's at the
bottom of the river.

487
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,918
What about Bruce Wayne?

488
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,670
Forget about him.

489
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,595
He's even more screwed-up than you.

490
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,277
You're more normal than you think.

491
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:10,201
Hey. You're up.

492
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,339
What's going on?

493
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:17,708
Barnes told me what
happened during the attack.

494
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,176
Nothing happened.

495
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:21,378
I heard the tape from the
interrogation room with Alice.

496
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:22,880
Listen to me...

497
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,131
Whatever Jervis is doing to you...

498
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:25,516
You need to uncuff me.

499
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:27,802
I can't do that.

500
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:33,224
I don't know what I would do
if something happened to you.

501
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:36,967
You'd be fine.

502
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,897
Do you really believe that?

503
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:42,316
You seemed to have moved on okay.

504
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,903
Yes, I moved on, Jim.

505
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:47,204
What choice did I have?

506
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,539
I went through the most

507
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:51,041
painful period of my life alone.

508
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:53,377
I cried myself to sleep every night.

509
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:57,164
And like an idiot, I would
wake up thinking, hoping that

510
00:25:57,216 --> 00:26:00,718
the next day, you would
show up at my door.

511
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,336
But you never did.

512
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,007
Mario was there for me
when I needed someone.

513
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:11,679
He was there as I tried to
put myself back together.

514
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,331
But I'm the one who doesn't care.

515
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:21,105
After everything that's happened,

516
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,023
you really have nothing to say to me?

517
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,281
The past is the past.

518
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,134
There's nothing I can do to change that.

519
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,511
Alice told me that her brother
preys on anger and regret.

520
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:45,045
I really don't want that to
be all that's left of us.

521
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:49,717
You mean all that's left of me.

522
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:53,053
Barnes asked me to put you
on a 48-hour suicide watch.

523
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:55,123
I've already signed off on it.

524
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,277
I know that we can't change the past,

525
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:03,480
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

526
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:15,626
Most of you guys have
been with me for a while.

527
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,411
You know me.

528
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:19,630
And I know Gotham

529
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:21,498
like the back of my hand.

530
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,152
Penguin,

531
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:29,506
when he's mayor, boys, I promise you,

532
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:33,510
we are gonna run this city, huh?

533
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:35,512
- To Butch!
- To Butch!

534
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,349
I...

535
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:39,767
What?

536
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:41,769
I lost track of the guy in the glasses.

537
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:42,853
Nygma?

538
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:45,689
That skinny loon gave you the slip?!

539
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,692
Yeah?

540
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:50,828
No.

541
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:53,864
No, no, that's not possible.

542
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:54,865
Let's go!

543
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,617
We got to go, guys! Come on!

544
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,842
Two of your brothers are dead.

545
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:08,145
The other two escaped
with Alice and Jervis.

546
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,898
And I need to know where
they're taking her.

547
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,357
Jervis gains a sister and
you lose two brothers?

548
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:22,893
That don't seem too fair.

549
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,878
Hmm?

550
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:28,048
I bet you were close growing up, huh?

551
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:31,402
Wrestling around the house,
driving your mom crazy.

552
00:28:31,404 --> 00:28:34,154
Five little kids all
dreaming of stardom.

553
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:38,042
Yeah, I'm a fan.

554
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,244
My dad used to always take me down

555
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:42,413
to the rassling matches at the Garden.

556
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:46,050
I also happen to know most luchadores...

557
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,087
request to be buried in their masks

558
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,889
as a sign of honor...

559
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:54,892
and respect.

560
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:56,427
I really, really hope
that wasn't the case

561
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,345
with your brothers.

562
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:02,349
This freak Jervis did
something to my friend,

563
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:04,485
and I need him to undo it.

564
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,437
Where are they taking her?

565
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:11,442
Okay, okay, I'll tell you!

566
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,293
Well?

567
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:32,062
You like it?

568
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:44,141
I know you were surprised
to see me last night...

569
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:49,029
and I want you to know
that I forgive you.

570
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,583
For everything.

571
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:54,902
But...

572
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:58,739
I want you to understand consequences

573
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:01,592
if you ever leave me again.

574
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:07,014
I need you to understand
how important you are to me.

575
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Don't. Please.

576
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,809
Now...

577
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:20,677
you might feel

578
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,013
a little prick.

579
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:51,059
Your escorts agreed

580
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:52,427
to take a long lunch.

581
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:56,431
- You know where they took Alice?
- Yeah.

582
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,349
But it's only a matter of
time until Barnes finds out

583
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:00,018
and sends in the cavalry.

584
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,602
How'd you find me?

585
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:03,354
Lee.

586
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,356
- Lee?
- Yeah.

587
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:06,524
She also told me

588
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:08,860
if you check out on my
watch, it's my head.

589
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:11,112
Guess you're gonna have to trust me.

590
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,531
Remember to chisel
that into my tombstone.

591
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:15,917
Let's go.

592
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,668
Thanks, Francisco.

593
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,810
Took you long enough.

594
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:26,928
Where's Selina?

595
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:28,162
She's not at her squat.

596
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:29,547
- If you did anything...
- She's fine.

597
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,632
- Where is she?
- She left a little while ago.

598
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:33,084
I don't know where she went.

599
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,635
I take you in and this
is the thanks I get?

600
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:36,752
You run around with Selina,
pretending to be me?

601
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,523
Is that why you're angry?

602
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:39,891
Because I was pretending to be you

603
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,476
or that I spent the day with Selina?

604
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:45,396
For someone who has everything,

605
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:48,199
you have no idea what you actually want.

606
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,819
Or maybe you're just
too scared to take it.

607
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:53,454
At least I know who I am.

608
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,789
Cool your boots, Master Bruce.

609
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:56,741
Let's all just take a breath, shall we?

610
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,126
Don't worry.

611
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:00,161
You won't be seeing me anymore.

612
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:01,612
Neither will she.

613
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,965
I don't know why I was created,

614
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,001
but I know I don't belong in Gotham.

615
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,996
Say good-bye to Selina for me.

616
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:17,762
And thank her for the kiss.

617
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:44,205
What are you going to use that for?

618
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:47,341
Oh, I imagine I'll...

619
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:49,427
mix it into

620
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,562
some public drinking fountain.

621
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:55,383
Create a few dozen monsters.

622
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,968
Please, Jervis.

623
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,369
Please.

624
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:01,272
- I'll do whatever you want.
- You will now.

625
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:02,607
Because you know the price

626
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:05,776
other people will pay if you don't.

627
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:10,481
I don't know what I would
ever do if I lost you.

628
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,569
That connection.

629
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,604
It keeps me sane.

630
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,458
It always has.

631
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:22,577
Tetch?

632
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:24,712
Jervis?

633
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,581
Don't move!

634
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:31,802
Mr. Gordon. I can't say
I'm entirely surprised.

635
00:33:31,838 --> 00:33:33,387
So stubborn.

636
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:35,756
- Let her go now.
- You know I can't do that.

637
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:39,310
But if you let me leave

638
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:40,645
with my dear sister,

639
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,398
my dear Alice...

640
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:48,986
then I'll free you from
that nasty little impulse.

641
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:51,989
Maybe you can live a long, happy...

642
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:54,775
Well, a long life.

643
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,314
Let her go and you live.

644
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,582
That's the deal.

645
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:03,834
One question.

646
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:13,628
Do you hear that?

647
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:22,970
Jim!

648
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:30,394
We both know what you really want.

649
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:33,197
I saw it in your eyes the first time

650
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,899
we met.

651
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,784
You want to be free.

652
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,820
Free from the pain.

653
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,124
And you can be.

654
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:48,579
Stop fighting

655
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,331
and let go.

656
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:55,803
The past is the past.

657
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,506
There's nothing I can do to change that.

658
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:05,179
There's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

659
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,564
No!

660
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:19,493
Well, well, Mr. Gordon breaks my spell!

661
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:24,198
I daresay it's time we bid
this foul city our good-bye.

662
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,199
- No!
- Alice!

663
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:26,534
I'll never go with you!

664
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,835
Why do you say such things?!

665
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,171
We belong together. You know that.

666
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:31,422
I love you.

667
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:33,124
- You're insane!
- No, no!

668
00:35:35,378 --> 00:35:36,927
No!

669
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:39,797
No!

670
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,550
You killed her!

671
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:05,573
You want to explain yourself?

672
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,492
I was following a lead.

673
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:09,026
You were following some misguided notion

674
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,278
about friendship.

675
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,029
James Gordon is gonna get you killed

676
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,365
one day, you get that?

677
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:15,616
Maybe.

678
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,034
But until that day,

679
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:20,004
I will never turn my back on him.

680
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,714
The night that all of Gotham

681
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,015
has been waiting for.

682
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,517
The final results should
be coming in shortly.

683
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,268
This is it.

684
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:36,270
The moment I've been waiting for.

685
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:37,438
Indeed.

686
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:38,389
You!

687
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:40,391
You, you ruined everything!

688
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:41,726
Butch, release him this instant!

689
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:42,977
What is going on?!

690
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,278
I'll tell you what's going on.

691
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:45,780
He just cost you the election.

692
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,899
He went to every district official

693
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,033
and took the money back.

694
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,119
Said you wanted to run a clean election.

695
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:53,704
Tell me this is not true.

696
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,124
I'm afraid Butch is right. For once.

697
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,043
Why?

698
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:01,468
After everything I've done for you.

699
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:03,928
Everything we could've done together.

700
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:06,130
You betrayed me.

701
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,098
Butch!

702
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,852
Give me one reason why I shouldn't

703
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:13,804
let Butch kill you where you stand.

704
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,439
Well, there are about 30 witnesses...

705
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:16,941
I don't care!

706
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,727
And there's that.

707
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,278
In what can only be viewed

708
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:23,981
as a seismic shift even
by Gotham standards,

709
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:27,201
former underworld
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

710
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:30,621
has won the mayor's
office by a landslide.

711
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,243
momentum based largely on
his outspoken criticism...

712
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,795
I still won.

713
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,581
Of how city officials and
the GCPD mishandled...

714
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,133
They really want me as mayor.

715
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:44,635
Yes.

716
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,389
I can't be bought,

717
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:51,104
but I can be stolen with one glance.

718
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,896
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

719
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,850
Love.

720
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,189
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

721
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:09,577
They love me.

722
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:11,111
If you would've bought the election,

723
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,413
you would've never known.

724
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,531
But now you do.

725
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,835
Feels good, doesn't it?

726
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,955
How did you know I would win?

727
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,041
I believe in you, Oswald.

728
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:26,460
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

729
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,215
You.

730
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,434
You never believed I could
win this election on my own.

731
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,937
I think maybe you're not
cut out for this after all.

732
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:38,105
What?! You got to be kidding me.

733
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,189
- This guy...
- Don't worry.

734
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,558
I still need someone to crack skulls.

735
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:44,395
Come, Ed.

736
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,313
We have plans to make.

737
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:57,074
You think we'll ever see him again?

738
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:59,076
Well, that I very much
doubt, Master Bruce.

739
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:02,546
I reckon he's gonna try and
get as far away from Gotham

740
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:03,580
as he possibly can.

741
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,332
I still wonder why
Hugo Strange made him.

742
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:06,583
Long lonely nights

743
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,936
in the laboratory, but
wanted someone to talk to.

744
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:13,307
Or some other nefarious reason.

745
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:15,225
Perhaps.

746
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:21,348
There is one thing.

747
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,018
Yes, Master Bruce?

748
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,987
Do you think Selina really kissed him?

749
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:28,856
- Aw, bloody hell.
- I mean, you've had

750
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,940
training in interrogation, right?

751
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,608
You can tell when someone's lying.

752
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,201
No, I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

753
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:35,105
And if she did kiss him, do you
think she thought he was me?

754
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:37,163
Good night, Master Bruce.

755
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,900
I bet she thought he was me.

756
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:49,760
Hey.

757
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:51,345
Hey.

758
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,297
You're here late.

759
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,799
Tweeds really did a
number on this place.

760
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,802
Guess I'm medical examiner-slash-medic.

761
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,805
Slash-resident therapist.

762
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:05,776
I wanted to thank you

763
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,195
for telling Bullock where to find me.

764
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,781
Heard about what happened
with Alice. You okay?

765
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:12,566
- Yeah.
- No.

766
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,984
I mean are you okay?

767
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,704
Whatever Jervis did to me...

768
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:18,989
it's over now.

769
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:21,492
I'm glad.

770
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,327
Guess I should get going.

771
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,462
Lee.

772
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,217
There's something I... need to tell you.

773
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:31,635
Something I should have told you

774
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,587
the moment I saw you back in Gotham.

775
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,806
Everything you said today...
I'm sorry about that.

776
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:38,058
Don't...

777
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:39,743
You were right.

778
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,346
And after everything
that happened today...

779
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:48,285
This is harder than I thought.

780
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,687
What is it, Jim?

781
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,858
I'm happy for you.

782
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:58,996
You are?

783
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:00,964
Trying to be.

784
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,585
Maybe we can start there.

785
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,370
Yeah.

786
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,705
I think we can do that.

787
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,562
Bruce Wayne?

788
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:33,814
No.

789
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,783
But you could be.

790
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:38,402
In fact, you could be so much more.

791
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,604
Who are you?

792
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,323
You might think of us as your parents.

793
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,461
We've been looking for
you for a long time.

794
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:56,553
It is with a humble heart

795
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,340
that I accept the trust placed
in me by this great city

796
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,810
to become your mayor.

797
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:06,430
The people have spoken, and
I have heard their call.

798
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,983
And as my first act as mayor,

799
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,687
I would like to introduce
you to my chief of staff,

800
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,874
Mr. Edward Nygma!

801
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,657
No.
