1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,632
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:25,150
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,576
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,746
Last night, on my way
to the morgue, I saw something.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,584
Taxi! Oh, come on, I'm gonna be late.

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,879
Simon Stagg, remember him?
Hasn't been seen in like six months.

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,965
You're saying Wells knows where Stagg is?

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,427
No, Wells killed him. I have evidence in a
secure digital file that will explain everything.

15
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,640
There is a tsunami heading for the city.
You need to get as far away as possible.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,059
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

17
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,354
Go.

18
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,928
Taxi, taxi!

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,306
Oh, come on, I'm going to be late!

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,182
Oh, boy.

21
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,268
Hey, what's going on?

22
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,561
- Dude!
- Yeah.

23
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,022
Cisco, I'm here.

24
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,357
What happened? Why'd you stop?

25
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,319
I just got a little disoriented.

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,155
You need to make up some time, man.
You'd better hurry up.

27
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,075
- Hurry? What are...?
- Hurry, as in, get to the morgue.

28
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,036
The morgue?

29
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,830
But I was there yesterday.

30
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,042
What are you talking about?
Come on, you gotta go.

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,398
Hey, Barr, what's with all the water?

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,609
Did the sprinkler system go off
or something?

33
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,655
What? No, I checked the sprinklers.
They're all intact.

34
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,199
But the water has ice in it.

35
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:42,996
And the bruises on the coroner aren't just
on his face. Check. Look at his torso.

36
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,583
Whoa.

37
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,796
- How the hell did you know that?
- He was killed by hail.

38
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,757
- We have to listen to the recording.
- Recording?

39
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,258
Joe, we got something.

40
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,596
The coroner's office just installed an
automated dictation system. Listen to this.

41
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,183
- Please, no more.
- I'll stop when you tell me.

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,768
- Stop.
- Who killed him?

43
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,522
That's Mark Mardon. He wants revenge.

44
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,821
- And I really don't want to go.
- He's your brother.

45
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,366
- Not by choice.
- Okay, well, how bad can a birthday party be?

46
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,993
Um, my folks think
Dante's stink don't stink.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,664
Doesn't matter how much he screws up
or how many times he gets in trouble...

48
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,666
in their eyes, he can do no wrong.

49
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,921
And yet they never fail to remind me
that I can do no right.

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,339
What if I came with you?

51
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,757
What? Seriously?

52
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,469
Absolutely. You've done so much for me.
Let me be there for you for a change.

53
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,722
And I can look at old
family photo albums...

54
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,641
and see what little Cisco looks like
without long hair.

55
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,477
I'm rescinding your invite.

56
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,021
Clyde Mardon has a brother?

57
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,649
So both Mardon brothers
survive the plane crash...

58
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,153
and the dark matter released
by the particle accelerator explosion...

59
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,072
- affects them in the same way.
- Virtually the same way.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,365
That's right.

61
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:06,329
Only Mark's not like Clyde at all. He can
do things that you couldn't even imagine.

62
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,833
- You mean he's sort of like a weather wizard?
- Weather wizard?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,585
Yeah.

64
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,714
- Trigeminal headache?
- Trigeminal headache?

65
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,176
Mister Allen.

66
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,136
A word, please.

67
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,930
Yeah.

68
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,394
You ruptured the time continuum,
didn't you?

69
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,480
You're experiencing temporal reversion.

70
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,148
- Yeah.
- How long?

71
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,359
A day and some change.
It's like I'm living it all over again.

72
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,613
Good. That means there's not too much
you could've messed up yet.

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,281
How did this happen?

74
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,284
I don't know. I mean I was running
faster than I've ever ran.

75
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,370
The first time I lived this day,
some horrible things happened.

76
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,831
- There was a tidal wave and...
- No. Do not tell me.

77
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,543
I do not wanna know anything
about the future you experienced. Nothing.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,717
- Okay, but, Doctor Wells...
- Barry, time is an extremely fragile construct.

79
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,012
Any deviation, no matter how small...

80
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,057
could result in a cataclysm.
Here's what you're going to do.

81
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:13,522
Everything you did before, every word
you uttered, every step you took...

82
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:18,193
you're going to do again. And you're not
going to tell anyone this happened.

83
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
Good day, Dr. Wells.

84
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,161
Time will tell, Gideon.

85
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,789
- Show me the future.
- As you wish.

86
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,625
The future remains intact, Dr. Wells.

87
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,379
If anything changes, alert me immediately.

88
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,631
Of course, doctor.

89
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,690
Hey.

90
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,319
What is going on with you? How'd you
figure all that stuff out at the morgue?

91
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,530
Lucky guesses, I guess.

92
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,200
Look, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get Mardon
if it kills me.

93
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,120
Joe. Um...

94
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,209
I gotta run an errand.
I'll see you later, all right?

95
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,896
I didn't know there was
anyone else like me.

96
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm gonna break out
and I'm gonna create a tidal wave...

97
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,154
that destroys your entire city.

98
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,866
So I still don't understand.

99
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,868
How did you find him?

100
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,202
Uh, I just had a hunch.

101
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,371
That's gotta be some kind of record.

102
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,581
Heh. Yeah.

103
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,169
Well, there goes my excuse
for bailing on my brother's birthday.

104
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,421
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

105
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,758
Yeah, I do.

106
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,595
- I just saved a lot of lives.
- I warned you not to mess with the timeline.

107
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,933
If you would let me tell you what was going
to happen, you'd understand why I did this.

108
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,686
Whatever tragedy
you think you've just averted...

109
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,689
time will find a way to replace it
and trust me, Barry...

110
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,901
the next one could be much worse.

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,375
- Don Santini, they're here.
- Move it.

112
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,093
Oh. Love the paneling. Mahogany?

113
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,512
So glad your house is made out of wood.

114
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,307
It's gonna be a pleasure watching it burn.

115
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,767
Refreshing.

116
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,395
What are you doing back in Central City,
Snart?

117
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,439
- This is my city.
- Our city.

118
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,402
I told you if I ever saw you again,
I'd put the hurt on you.

119
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,945
You stir up trouble.

120
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,447
Trouble is bad for business.

121
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:15,829
It's time for you and your family to pack
up, leave town, retire to warmer climates.

122
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,248
And if we don't?

123
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,500
You will all freeze.

124
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,918
Or burn.

125
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,004
I heard about your guns.

126
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,964
Also heard that you lost them.

127
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,966
So tell me, Snart...

128
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,721
what the hell are you and your pyro
friend gonna do without your fancy weapons?

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,222
This.

130
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,824
Now, that was fun. Fun, fun, fun.

131
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,034
Go.

132
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,914
Tell the rest of the Santini family
there's a new godfather.

133
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,959
And his name is Cold.

134
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,016
Wow. Your parents really went all out
with the cake.

135
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,478
Oh, well, it is Dante's birthday,
the most important day of the year.

136
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,814
Mijo was invited to play Carnegie Hall
when he was just 13 years old.

137
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,691
They invited the entire band, Mama.

138
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,985
That doesn't make it any less worthwhile.

139
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,655
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey.

140
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,657
- Glad you could make it.
- Of course.

141
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,701
Hi, I'm Dante.

142
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,037
- This is my friend, Caitlin.
- Hi, Caitlin.

143
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,497
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

144
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,998
Here, I got you this.

145
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,001
- I think you'll really like it, it's...
- Thanks, man.

146
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,504
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

147
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,015
I don't get it.

148
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,520
I've been running just as fast as I was when
it happened and nothing. I'm still here.

149
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,273
Anything could've triggered the wormhole
that allowed you to repeat your day.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,610
Your emotions, circumstances,
cortisol levels, all of the above.

151
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,030
I mean, my adrenaline was super high
since Iris and the entire city...

152
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,366
No, no, no, no details, I told you.

153
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,911
I'm sorry, but Mark Mardon's
already locked in the pipeline...

154
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,538
and nothing bad has happened.

155
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,914
Yet.

156
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,918
- Detective.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

157
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,130
So when were you planning on telling me
you took down Mardon?

158
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,966
I just haven't had a chance yet.

159
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,468
- You got sidetracked.
- You can't be mad.

160
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,554
I'm not mad. But I am curious.

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,098
I mean, you were acting so weird
at the crime scene.

162
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,726
- I always act weird.
- Okay, weirder.

163
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,734
Look, Joe, there are just some things
that I can't tell you...

164
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,070
and you're gonna have to trust me.

165
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,991
Hey, Linda.

166
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,786
Yeah, I know, I'm so sorry, I lost track.
I'm gonna head that way now.

167
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,997
All right, bye.

168
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,791
I have a lunch date with Linda.
I gotta run.

169
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,795
And I don't suppose
you're gonna fill me in either?

170
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,380
- No.
- Mm.

171
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,763
Here is one who was touched by God.

172
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,269
I was a little rusty.
I haven't played in a while.

173
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,771
Well, if that was what you sounded like
rusty...

174
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,774
I can't imagine what you sound like
when you've practiced.

175
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,694
For you, I'd practice morning, noon
and night.

176
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,697
That means you'd actually have to get up
in the morning.

177
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,950
So Mom tells me you're still working
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

178
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,785
Yeah. Why?

179
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,329
No reason, man.

180
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,664
Guess it was just hard to find another job.

181
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,292
I wasn't looking.
I like working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

182
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,462
And we couldn't do what we do
without Cisco.

183
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,298
He's loyal. Just like a dog.

184
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,802
Come on, why are you so serious, mija?

185
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,728
Happy birthday.

186
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,484
Hey, I am here. So sorry again.

187
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,737
Well, you get a pass
considering you're never late.

188
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,159
Hey, what's going on with you lately?

189
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,328
Nothing.

190
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,373
Come on, give me a little credit here.

191
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,882
I've just been dealing
with a lot of things lately.

192
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,052
I like you, Linda, and we really get along.

193
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,264
Relationships should be more
than just getting along.

194
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,850
Your heart should ache for me.

195
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,478
Does it?

196
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,530
You're not upset with me?

197
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,908
No one did anything wrong.

198
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,372
I really do feel a lot for you, Linda.
It's just...

199
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,001
Just not as much as you feel
for someone else.

200
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,214
Go get her.

201
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,515
"The Flash. Speeding his way
into our lives."

202
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,934
That's a little bit on the nose,
don't you think?

203
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,728
I have something to show you.

204
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,396
Simon Stagg. Remember him?

205
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,481
Hasn't been heard from in nearly a year...

206
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,400
Hey, Iris. Mr. Bridge, hi.

207
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,402
Do I know you?

208
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,406
Oh. No. We haven't met. Yet. Fully.

209
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,827
- Iris, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

210
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,287
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,748
Nice meeting you, strange young man.

212
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,460
Is everything okay with you and Linda?

213
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,878
Uh...

214
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,421
No, that's done.

215
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,257
Oh, I am so sorry.

216
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,634
No, no, no, it's okay,
we're gonna be friends.

217
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,970
Yeah, no, it's gonna be awesome.

218
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,348
Uh, anyway, are you...?

219
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,517
Are you free tomorrow?
Do you wanna get some coffee?

220
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,104
And we can just talk
and just tell each other stuff.

221
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,941
I don't know, stuff we got rolling around
in there. You know, I don't know.

222
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,152
Okay, yeah, sure, sounds great.

223
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay, great. Great.
All right, I'll see you.

224
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,663
I know you think Harrison Wells
had something...

225
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,540
to do with Simon Stagg's
disappearance.

226
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,958
But you're wrong.

227
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,636
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.

228
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,973
Thanks for meeting me here.
Even though, um, you can't get drunk.

229
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,353
- No worries.
- So how was your day?

230
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,148
Great. But Linda and I did break up.

231
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,903
That's the first time I've heard anyone
use the word "great" to describe a breakup.

232
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,825
I have a feeling that I'm about to move
forward with someone really special.

233
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,161
Okay, go ahead, Barry.

234
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:18,751
Hi. I don't normally do this,
but I was watching you and...

235
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,211
can I buy you a drink?

236
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,840
Uh...

237
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,261
- Wow. I'm really flattered, but I...
- Actually, I was talking to him.

238
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,513
Um...

239
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,682
I'm sorry, you said you were talking to me?

240
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,144
Yeah, I just told my friends over there
that I thought you were cute...

241
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,522
and they dared me to come over here
and talk to you.

242
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,773
So please talk to me.

243
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,863
Yeah, yeah, I suppose I can talk to you
for a little bit.

244
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,700
- Dude, get out.
- Yeah, I was just leaving.

245
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,660
Make me proud.

246
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,540
- I'm Lisa, by the way.
- Hi, Cisco.

247
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,877
I'm just in town for the symposium
at Mercury Labs.

248
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,796
- Really? What do you do?
- I'm a structural engineer.

249
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,425
Why do you look so surprised?
Can't a girl be an engineer?

250
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,760
No, of course. That's...

251
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,221
You just don't look like an engineer.

252
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,557
I can't help how I look.

253
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:19,312
I mean, it's good. It's a good look.
It's a great look.

254
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,981
You don't look so bad yourself.

255
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,569
Am I being pranked right now?

256
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,914
What do you think?

257
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,877
I can't believe this.
The day started out pretty terrible...

258
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,921
but it's turning out pretty damn good.

259
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,631
- I'll say.
- Wow.

260
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,467
Look at this, these are nice digs.

261
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,302
Oh, we're just squatting.

262
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,930
- We?
- Yeah.

263
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Me and my brother.

264
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,477
Hello, Cisco.

265
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,814
What exactly are your intentions
with my sister?

266
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,316
Oh, come on.

267
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,610
I should've known better.
I am not that lucky.

268
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,155
Please don't kill me
for kissing your sister.

269
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,365
You kissed him?

270
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,784
- You're not Dad, Lenny.
- I know, Dad's in jail.

271
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,285
Sterling role model.

272
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,870
What do you want, Snart?

273
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,624
Guns.
Heat and cold, to be precise.

274
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,669
There's no way I'm making weapons for you.

275
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,796
- Never again.
- Mick.

276
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,807
I know I would do everything in my power
to protect my family.

277
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,185
The question is, will you?

278
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,250
Dante, Dante, just keep cool, okay?
Let me do my thing.

279
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,878
Really? And you're gonna save us
with your "mechanical engineering" skills?

280
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,340
Right now my skills are the only things
keeping us alive, so shut up.

281
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,843
- You shut up.
- Ah.

282
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,137
There she is.

283
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,889
I missed this baby.

284
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,184
Here it is. All finished.
You gonna let us go now?

285
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,314
You know, I took the first gun you made me
apart dozens of times.

286
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,482
Learned how it ticked. What went where.

287
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,080
Thought you could tamper with
the firing pin without me noticing?

288
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
Nice try, kid.

289
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,048
Yes.

290
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,383
Lenny, where's my gun?

291
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,260
Girl's gotta defend herself.

292
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,889
Besides, why should you two
have all the fun?

293
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,558
My sister needs a weapon.

294
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,852
Something that suits her personality.

295
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,356
Make me something pretty and toxic.
Like me.

296
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,485
How about something with gold?

297
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,655
Gold. Heh.

298
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,875
Hey. One incredibly heavy cronut
and one Americano with an extra shot.

299
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,045
- Just the way I like it.
- Just the way you like it. Yeah, I know.

300
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,297
I know you, Iris. Ahem.

301
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,095
So, um, what is going on with you?

302
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,138
You're acting like Christmas came early.

303
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,431
Heh. Uh...

304
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,268
Yeah, no, I guess it did, kind of.

305
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:53,567
Iris, I still think about you all the time,
and I know you've been thinking about me too.

306
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:58,114
- So let's just stop thinking and start doing.
- Barry.

307
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,992
I know. I know that we both have
awful timing, but we were meant to be...

308
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,078
Barry, what are you talking about?

309
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,831
You and me.

310
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,290
We like each other.

311
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,503
Barry, we've been over this.

312
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,463
Okay? Nothing has changed for me.

313
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,424
No, but it has.

314
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,426
How do you know that?

315
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,304
I just...

316
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,474
I just know some stuff. Somehow.

317
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,144
I don't know, maybe it's like ESP
or something...

318
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,523
Barry, I love Eddie, okay?

319
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,818
I'm sorry, but nothing has changed for me
since Christmas.

320
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,654
And you can't keep springing this on me,
okay?

321
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:43,200
It's not fair that you keep making me
the bad guy who keeps telling you no.

322
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,879
What? No whoosh in?

323
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,673
- I needed the walk.
- What happened?

324
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,217
Nothing. Uh...

325
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,886
Linda.

326
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,512
Iris.

327
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,348
I don't wanna talk about it actually.

328
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,350
Okay.

329
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,021
Have you talked to Cisco?
I've been trying, but he's not answering.

330
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,483
I'm kind of worried about him.
He had a rough night.

331
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,527
Trust me. It got better.

332
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,617
- Hey, Joe, what's up?
- Yeah, Snart's back.

333
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,869
Wait, Cold is back?

334
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,872
Yeah, he was spotted
at the Santini crime family casino.

335
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,167
If he's hitting the Santinis, we could be
looking at a mob war.

336
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,341
Well, this day just keeps getting better,
doesn't it?

337
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,731
You killed my brother.

338
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,067
You shouldn't have messed with my family.

339
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,530
That's funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about ours.

340
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,741
All that glitters.

341
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
This is sick.

342
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,090
You wanted us to spend more time together.

343
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,602
How many times
are we gonna go through this?

344
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,438
Until the best man wins.

345
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,400
Drop the gun.

346
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,322
We both know you're not
going to do anything to her.

347
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,743
Oh, by the way, meet my baby sister.

348
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,912
Lisa, Flash. Flash, Lisa.

349
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,458
Cisco has been very, very busy.

350
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:01,463
Unless you want me to mail small,
frozen pieces of him back to his family...

351
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,258
I'd take your hands off her.

352
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,350
Let him go, Snart.

353
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,354
I'll think about it.

354
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,948
God.

355
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,541
Barr.

356
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,336
Witnesses reported seeing the Flash.

357
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,589
They said you had Snart dead to rights,
but you let him go. Why?

358
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,965
Cisco.

359
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,384
- Snart and his sister have him.
- Oh, man.

360
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,721
Okay. Get to S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'll get there when I can.

361
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,848
All right.

362
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,185
- Allen.
- Eddie, I...

363
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,145
Whoa!

364
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,522
- Stay away from Iris.
- What is going on here?

365
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:04,777
- Hey, if you two have a beef, take it outside.
- You know what the worst part is, Barry?

366
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,862
I thought you and I were friends.

367
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,705
So there's Cisco getting into a car
with Snart's sister.

368
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,499
The license plate is iced over.

369
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,503
All right, Dr. Wells, you were right.

370
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,047
I screwed with time,
now time is screwing with me.

371
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,383
Cold is back, he kidnapped Cisco,
and Iris...

372
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,219
Stop before you cause
another disruption to the timeline.

373
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,388
Please, Dr. Wells.

374
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,184
Please, I have to talk to someone.

375
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,480
Go ahead.

376
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:47,736
In the previous version of today...

377
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,699
Captain Singh is seriously injured...

378
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,828
Joe is in danger,
and Iris said she had feelings for me.

379
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,209
And now Cisco's life is on the line and Iris
has no idea she confessed those feelings.

380
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:08,048
But she still has them, right?

381
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:15,264
The unconscious mind, Barry,
is a powerful thing.

382
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,516
It sounds like...

383
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:23,647
it took this apparent
disaster to jar those feelings loose.

384
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,443
And without that disaster,
those feelings remain deeper down.

385
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,446
Un-accessed.

386
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,781
I don't understand.

387
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,952
I thought that I was helping people
by stopping Mardon.

388
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:42,082
Yes, but this new ability of yours,
Barry, is a dangerous thing.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,628
You only traveled back in time one day.
What if you traveled back decades?

390
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,506
Centuries?

391
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,468
Imagine the havoc you could wreak.

392
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,474
But I will have the opportunity...

393
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,188
to travel back in time in the
near future and save my mom.

394
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,150
Are...? You're saying I shouldn't?

395
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,281
I'm saying how many more
people could die...

396
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,867
if your mother lives?

397
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,994
Did you guys find Cisco?

398
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,377
Most people think the hottest part
of the flame is the white part.

399
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,338
They're wrong.

400
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,174
You gonna admire those or drink them?

401
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,136
Both.

402
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

403
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,923
I told her you wanted to become a priest.

404
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,551
Broke her heart.

405
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,052
Why'd you do that?

406
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,847
Because I was jealous of you, man.

407
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:26,061
Even then,
I knew exactly where my life was headed.

408
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,188
- Nowhere.
- Dante...

409
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,149
that's not true.

410
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,694
I live at home
and I work a crap job for no pay.

411
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,697
Yeah, but you still manage to be
Mom and Dad's favorite.

412
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,075
I don't even know why.

413
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,413
It's because they still think of me
as their son, the concert pianist.

414
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,374
But you, man,
they never understood your talents.

415
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,128
Never understood that you pursued
your passion no matter what.

416
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,881
And me, I was just too scared to even try.

417
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,350
Dan... Dante.

418
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,768
No.

419
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,863
Mick?

420
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,157
Mick, calm down.

421
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,618
Mick. We need them.

422
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,869
Mick.

423
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,372
Baby, it sounds like you're hungry.

424
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,334
How about you and I grab some dinner?

425
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,961
I like you, kid.

426
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,216
You're smart, you pulled yourself up
from humble beginnings.

427
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,009
You seem like a good brother.

428
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,303
Yeah. You too.

429
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,888
Debatable.

430
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,059
You answer one question for me,
I'll let you and your brother walk.

431
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:53,023
- What's the question?
- The Flash, who is he?

432
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,029
I swear, he always wears a mask.

433
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,824
No! No, stop.

434
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,370
This is first-degree frostbite.

435
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,830
Your brother could recover
with proper treatment.

436
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,668
If not, all his tendons, blood vessels
and nerves will freeze.

437
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,295
His fingers will need to be amputated.

438
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,548
No more concertos
for the Ramon family holidays.

439
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,512
Now tell me, who is the Flash?

440
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,814
There's nothing
on the satellite thermography.

441
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,524
You were right. This is my fault.

442
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,027
- How is this your fault?
- Brave heart, Barry. We'll get Cisco back.

443
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,405
I'm back.

444
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,198
My God, are you okay?

445
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,575
We were so worried.

446
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,287
- What happened?
- How did you escape?

447
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,957
I didn't.

448
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,167
Snart just let you go. Why?

449
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,839
He tortured my brother.

450
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:04,594
And he said he was gonna kill him
if I didn't...

451
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,389
If I didn't tell him...

452
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,141
Tell him what?

453
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,437
Who the Flash really is.

454
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,234
I... Honestly, man,
they could've killed me...

455
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,780
but they were gonna kill my brother.

456
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,116
I couldn't let them do that.

457
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,953
Hey.

458
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,248
- I'm sorry, Barry. I'm so sorry.
- No.

459
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,835
I put you in that position.

460
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,131
I'm the one who's sorry.

461
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,097
Where you going?

462
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,644
I don't deserve to be here.

463
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,858
I won't be the one
to put you in jeopardy, not again.

464
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,694
Never again.

465
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,746
Hey.

466
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,207
What? What a surprise.

467
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,755
As big a surprise as Eddie punching Barry
at a crime scene this evening.

468
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,799
Oh, my God. Is Barry okay?

469
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,760
Yeah, he heals fast.

470
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,929
Look, Iris, this got complicated.

471
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,265
I know. I'm sorry.

472
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,643
Barry was too late. I'm with Eddie.

473
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,063
Let me ask you something.

474
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,275
Who do you love?

475
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,362
I mean, I love Eddie.

476
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,532
Okay. You need to make them believe that...

477
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,784
because I'm not sure
either of them does.

478
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,869
Okay?

479
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,500
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

480
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,960
Not enough.

481
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,211
See you later.

482
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,467
- Bad time?
- Yes, actually.

483
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,986
Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon.

484
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,699
Well, before you shuffle off forever...

485
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,492
may I show you something?

486
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,419
I get it.

487
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,255
- I failed.
- No, no, no.

488
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,757
Now, you're an incredibly
clever guy, Cisco.

489
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,886
So why don't you tell me...

490
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,221
why would I bring you down here?

491
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,228
Because we all failed that night,
but we kept going.

492
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,610
We kept trying to protect each other
and Barry, despite the setbacks.

493
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,280
Making a choice between
two people you love...

494
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,741
that is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

495
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:17,913
Well, you won't have to worry about me
making the wrong decision again.

496
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,832
All you proved today, Mr. Ramon...

497
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,250
Is that you're human.

498
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,421
All you proved today
is that you love your brother.

499
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,967
And the reason that
we all want you to stay...

500
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,969
is that we love you too.

501
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,265
Now, I am not a parent...

502
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:43,772
but in many ways, you have shown me
what it's like to have a son.

503
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,194
Guys, you should get up here.

504
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,405
Shall we?

505
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,828
The casino wasn't the target.

506
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,580
Then why did he do it?

507
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,626
Casinos keep tons of cash on hand
to cover their markers.

508
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,630
But if they're under attack, protocol is
to relocate the money outside the casino.

509
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,092
So that was Snart's plan all along,
to trigger the move.

510
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,385
Okay, where is it now?

511
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,817
Get ready. We got company.

512
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,415
Good to see you, Barry.

513
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,793
We have to talk.

514
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,050
I know Cisco told you who I am.

515
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,053
Can't really blame the
kid for giving you up.

516
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,848
You or his brother? Come on.
I put him in a tight spot.

517
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,476
Same kind I got you in right now.

518
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,313
Can't really stop me,
now that I know who you are.

519
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,233
I could speed you to my private prison
where you'll never see the light of day.

520
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,195
But then I won't be around
to stop my own private uplink...

521
00:35:55,403 --> 00:36:00,241
that'll broadcast your identity to the
world. So the million-dollar question:

522
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,078
What to do with me now, Barry Allen?

523
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:07,082
I won't let you keep stealing whatever
you want, whenever you feel like it.

524
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,084
- It needs to end.
- Can't do that.

525
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,419
- It's what I do.
- Find a new line of work.

526
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,089
- Don't want to.
- Why's that?

527
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,384
The same reason
you keep running after guys like me.

528
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,719
The adrenaline. The thrill of the chase.

529
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,391
I love this game. And I'm very good at it.

530
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,267
Then go play it somewhere else.

531
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,770
- Leave Central City.
- Can't do that either.

532
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,605
I love it here.

533
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,691
This city is my home.

534
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,363
You've seen what I can do.

535
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,699
You know that I can stop you.

536
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,786
You wanna keep
pushing your luck, go for it.

537
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,665
But from here on out, no one else dies.

538
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,291
If you're as good as you say...

539
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,044
you don't have to kill anyone
to get what you want.

540
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,756
That's true.

541
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:04,806
And if you or anyone
in your rogues gallery...

542
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,977
goes near
any of my friends or family again...

543
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,939
I don't care who
you tell my identity to.

544
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,899
I'm putting you away.

545
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,324
I guess your secret's safe, Flash.

546
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,326
For now.

547
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:37,297
Oh, I don't suppose you'd give me
a ride back to town, would you?

548
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,263
The Rogues.

549
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,348
Cute.

550
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,156
I am so sorry, pal.

551
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,951
It's not like me to hit anyone.
I don't know what came over me.

552
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,204
Uh, thanks, Eddie. It's okay.

553
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,956
You poor thing. I had no idea.

554
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,708
Is that right? Um...

555
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,377
But what exactly
did you have no idea about?

556
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,089
I was just explaining to Iris and
Eddie about your Lightning Psychosis.

557
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,842
- My what now?
- Your Lightning Psychosis.

558
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,638
How your recent odd behavior is a
side effect of being struck by lightning.

559
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,976
Mood swings, sudden outbursts of affection,
and other lapses in judgment.

560
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,355
He has had all of those things.
He told me that he had ESP.

561
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,732
It's a very uncommon
neurological phenomenon.

562
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,069
We're really only just now starting
to research in kerauno-medicine.

563
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,988
That's why Barry's been
spending time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

564
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,658
I just wish you would've told me.

565
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,828
It hardly feels real sometimes.

566
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,038
- We're just glad you're getting help.
- Yeah.

567
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,626
- So we're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

568
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,837
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

569
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,342
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

570
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,405
Oh, come on. Hey.

571
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,451
Harrison Wells.

572
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,789
What do you know about him?

573
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,674
What do you know?

574
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,676
Everything I know is in that drive.

575
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,303
I swear.

576
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,809
Everything?

577
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,478
Everything. Just take it.

578
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,162
You really were
on to the story of the century.

579
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,208
Well, this century anyway.

580
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,805
Do you think I made a mistake?
Letting Snart go?

581
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,225
You did what you felt
was right in the moment.

582
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:40,813
And really, Barry,
that's the best any of us can hope for.

583
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,610
For now, let's be thankful
the timeline remains intact.

584
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,741
Oh, I keep forgetting, I've been meaning
to ask you. It's about Simon.

585
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,038
You were saying, Mr. Allen?

586
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,748
Uh...

587
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,167
Nothing. Sorry.

588
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,004
- 'Night, Dr. Wells.
- Goodnight, Barry.

589
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,910
Barr, what's up?

590
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,079
Why'd you wanna meet up here so late?

591
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,375
I think that maybe
you were right about Dr. Wells.

592
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,003
Which part?

593
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,339
All of it.

594
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:56,363
