Now we can talk about the real business.

188

I think they mean to set light to it.

In this sinful place
there will be temptations.

199

It's my responsibility as your wife
to help you resist those temptations.

Yes, love, we know.

All right, he's an hour late.
Fuck him.

213
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,440
This business directly affects Arthur,
but he's not here,

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
so we'll take a vote without him.

215
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
What business?

216
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,320
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

217
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,960
An informant told us

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,960
that six years ago, Luca Changretta
came from New York to Birmingham

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,960
to be best man at his cousin's wedding.

220
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,600
POLLY: We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn on Broad gate

221
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
for the photographs.

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,720
The photographer kept the negatives.

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,160
I persuaded him to give us copies.

224
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,480
And to enlarge this one.

225
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,240
That is Luca Changretta.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,840
TOMMY: I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

227
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,800
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

228
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
which means the chances are
they are the men who come to kill us.

229
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,040
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

230
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,920
Then we put it about
that there's a reward for information.

231
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,920
We also propose that we give a copy
of this photograph to Mr Aberama Gold.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,280
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

233
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,800
Tradition will just fuck us up.

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,080
We should wait for Arthur.

235
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,920
Arthur's not here, Ada.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,040
We need Luca Changretta dead. That's it.

237
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
Dropping the law of the bullet

238
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,080
is part of the process of modernisation
that I was working on before I...

239

Before I was executed.

You weren't executed, Poll.

241
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,400

the woman that raised him came in here.

She has every right to come in here.

let someone know.
We thought you were dead.

There's 15 fucking Italians out there.

No there's not, there's 13.

I just killed two of them.

Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

341

I did it.

You took a vote in my absence.

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,040
All right, calm down
and tell me about the men you killed.

352
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,040
You put my job out for contract.

Yeah, well, I'm gonna make it
my fucking job anyway.

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,520
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

362
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,720
Through the back fucking door

that was supposed to be
locked and bolted.

364
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

Yeah. Why don't you sit down
and work it out for yourself.

Just fire the gun, Arthur.

there are rules between a man and woman.

Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

Was it fear of the Italians

420
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
or hatred of us

421
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,240
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

422
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,720
I didn't unlock any door.

I run a factory

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
I live in a street
full of men laid off or on strike.

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,280
Look at the photograph, Mr Devlin,
and tell me who are the men

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
-that contacted you.
-No.

And you ask me why I'm getting on
the midnight train to Glasgow.

440

Who else has the keys to that door?

441
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,760
They hang on a hook inside my office.

442
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,080
Today I left the office unlocked.

443
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,040
-Why?
-Because I forgot.

444
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,800
Because I left in a hurry.

445
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,480
Because there were men
trying to set fire to the factory.

446
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,880
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

447
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,520
You have a lot of enemies.

448
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,040
Communists. Italians.

449
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,040
Before the factory came out on strike,

450
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,360
I heard word that two Italians attended
a communist party meeting in Stechford.

451
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,240
They hardly spoke English.

452
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,760
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory,

453
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,280
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

454
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,520
Mr Shelby, my train leaves at 12:00.

455
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,040
It's just gone 11 :00.
I can still make it.

I did some research on you.

It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

KittyJurossi.

501
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,840
You were in love with Kitty's sister.
Greta Jurossi. Before the war.

502
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,600
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

503
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,720
Her parents were Italian.

504
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,920
They didn't approve of a Watery Lane
Gypsy, but you won them over.

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,960
With your charm. Sweetness.

Very, very thorough research.

507
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,360
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption.

508
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,240
And Kitty said you were at her bedside
for three months.

509
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Every day, holding her hand.

510
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,760
And after she died you went away to war.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,680
Kitty said that the sweet boy who left
never came back.

512
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,600
No one came back.

513

Here's the funniest thing.

514
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,600
She said in those days
you believed in things.

515
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,320
In justice. Fairness.

516
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Once you saw a man beating his horse
and you fought him.

517
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,480
He was twice your size but you beat him.

518
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,320
And then you beat him with his own whip.

519

Kitty always liked to tell tall tales.

520
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,280
She's a party member now.

521
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,680
She swears
before you enlisted in the army

522
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,040
you joined the Communist party yourself.

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,360
You were dancing alone.

I've also done my research.

529
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Your sweetheart was at Passchendaele.

When he came back,
he was listed among the shell shocked.

You haven't looked.

534
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,800
This afternoon two men came into
my factory and tried to kill my brother.

535
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,120
I believe a Stechford Communist party
member let him in.

I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

I should send you her love
from the good old days

I've already identified the buildings.

656
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,240
Two former workhouses.

657
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,440
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

658
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,280
All right, come on, let's go.

659
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,960
Why?

660
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,840
Because I promised someone
I'd change the world.

661
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,680
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

662
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,360
Yeah, I know.

663
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,280
Come on.

00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,000
-How was your day?
-Yeah, it was okay.

667
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,040
Good man. Well done.

668
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,000
No trouble?

669
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,120
No. No trouble.

670
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,720
And she looked after you?

671
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,240
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

672
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,840
Not when they don't even want to do it,

673
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,680
except for the money.

674
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,760
Everything's for the money, Finn.

675
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,560
Yeah, I know. But...

676
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,200
She said, "Be a man."

677
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,640
And were you a man?

678
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,760
Yeah.

679
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,960
But then I apologised to her.
Because she looked so tired.

680
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,880
Sit down, Finn.

Right, listen to me, Finn.

683
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,440
She was right.

684
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,800
You need to be a fucking man.

685
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,560
People get tired.

686
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,640
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

687
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,320
I don't go round apologising.
Do I?

688
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,680
No.

689
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,080
There's an empty space here
to be filled.

690

Do you understand?

691
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,960
-Yeah.
-So...

692
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,160
Be a fucking man.

693
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,320
Okay, Tom.

00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,320
Yes.

706
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
So?

707
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,840
The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds.

708

And I will ask you
to spare Finn and Arthur.

709
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,320
In return for what?

710
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,840
Tommy Shelby.

711
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,560
And, uh, why should I trust you?

712
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,520
Because you know our history.

713
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,800
You know what happened between us.

714
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,000
You are an unlikely Cassius.

LUCA: Mmm...

716
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,360
You know, my mother...

717
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,000
My mother knew your mother.

718
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,640
She taught her how to read.

719
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,520
Did she tell you
that John and Arthur spared her life?

720
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,120
When Tommy wanted her dead.

721
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,800
Yeah.

722
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,080
And now she's given me
the information about you people.

723
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,240
So Tommy Shelby was right.

724
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,720
His, uh, ruthlessness

725
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,320
was justified.

726
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,600
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

727
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,800
John was a good boy.

728
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,760
Arthur tries.

729
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,480
Tommy's different.

730
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,040
You take Tommy.
Spare the rest.

731

You know,

732
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,400
my mother used to say this about you.

733
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,600
She said,
"That Polly Gray,

734

"that child would never
let go of a grievance."
