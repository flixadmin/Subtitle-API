1
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:46,144
Obviously, a lot of it's temp.

2
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:47,095
I love it.

3
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:48,234
If we're airing on TLC

4
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,151
between My 600-lb Life

5
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,649
and Little People, Big World.

6
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,821
But we're not.

7
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,488
'Cause we're not
cheap reality garbage.

8
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,948
Sorry, Courtenay,
I thought, um...

9
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,217
I-I was trying to go for
something a bit more personable,

10
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,541
- down-to-earth.
- Not this down-to-earth.

11
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,554
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

12
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:07,538
We here are not
fucking Heidi and Spencer.

13
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:10,959
We are The Seven, James.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,460
And why isn't there anything
on Starlight?

15
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,094
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

16
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,132
Where the hell is she?

17
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,635
Has a heavenly body
lost her luster?

18
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,808
Two weeks after
Starlight's shocking appearance

19
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,267
at the Believe Expo...

20
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,847
Social media is still buzzing

21
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,691
about her controversial speech.

22
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,227
Was it a breakdown

23
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,980
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

24
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,822
my thoughts are with Starlight,

25
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:35,897
and, uh,
I support her in every way.

26
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,403
What I want to know,
who's that dude

27
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,155
that stuck his
in her face?

28
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:41,446
She should that
er in the hole.

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,200
O-kay.

30
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:47,543
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,540
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

32
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,422
You and me, we have
a Panera gift card to win.

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,250
- No distractions. Come on.
- Ah, good one here.

34
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,756
Before joining The Seven,

35
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:59,297
which hero led
a search-and-rescue team...

36
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,432
- Mm...
- Oh, my God. -...after the 1994

37
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,099
Northridge earthquake?

38
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:04,307
Isn't it your job

39
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,677
to know this kind of stuff?

40
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:06,893
Eh...

41
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,022
- It's Lamplighter.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,203
Yeah, I had
all the trading cards.

43
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,227
Of course you did.

44
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,264
Hughie?

45
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,895
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

46
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:18,993
After Gary's store,

47
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:21,068
we all thought that...

48
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:22,866
Oh. H-Hi.

49
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,407
Uh, Anthony.

50
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,120
Hughie's best-looking friend
since fourth grade.

51
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:28,251
Hi, I'm Annie.

52
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,457
It's nice to meet you.

53
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,617
You look familiar.

54
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,205
- Did you go to Kennedy?
- She's, uh,

55
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,250
- new in town.- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

56
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:37,884
So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

57
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,382
Mmm.

58
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:42,093
So, uh, Gretchen Scaramucci...

59
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,804
- No, no.
- ...she was bigger

60
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,814
than all the guys. Like,

61
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,486
André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

62
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:51,635
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

63
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,015
for making a crack
about her girlfriend...

64
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:55,733
- Oh, you didn't.
- ...Hughie gives her

65
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,783
this Clint Eastwood stare,
like...

66
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,648
And then, bam, runs,

67
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,244
like Forrest Gump-runs,

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,570
five blocks down
into a pet store

69
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,076
where he hides behind
this jumbo bag

70
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,499
of Kibbles 'n Bits
for four hours.

71
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,829
Oh...

72
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,213
I'll be right back.

73
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,340
I know it! I know this!

74
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,023
Surprised to run
into you here, man.

75
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,217
Yeah. Same goes for you.

76
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,507
I've been worried, asshole.

77
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,511
Ever since Robin, you...

78
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,763
you weren't answering
your phone.

79
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,595
Like, for all I knew,
you were chugging Drano.

80
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,102
I'm sorry, man.

81
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,524
Yeah, you should be.

82
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,692
No, really,
I-I should've called.

83
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,270
You think?

84
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,855
I'm okay.

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,110
Really. I-I just...

86
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,033
n-needed a fresh start.

87
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,571
Fresh start?

88
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:53,287
Your fresh start
is way out of your league.

89
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,870
Um, you know that, right?

90
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:56,285
I am aware, yes.

91
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,552
Annie's great, man.

92
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,957
Live your life.

93
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:02,665
That's what Robin would want.

94
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,825
Sync mark.

95
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,139
We're good.

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,984
- You rolling?
- And... action.

97
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,810
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

98
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,856
He was, uh, an amazing man.

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,190
Oh, the old piano.

100
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:24,421
Every night, Mom would sit here

101
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,655
and she would play some songs
and...

102
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:29,327
I got to be honest, most of the
time, me and my dad would be...

103
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,616
we'd be making model planes.

104
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,409
I can almost smell
the... silver paint.

105
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,329
I really wish
he'd lived long enough

106
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,835
to see me fly
with the Blue Angels.

107
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,798
That would have blown his mind.

108
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:44,218
That's me in the middle.

109
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,465
Love you, Mom, Dad.

110
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:51,063
Welcome to my bedroom.

111
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:53,016
The Baseball Hall of Fame,
you might call it.

112
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:54,387
Hasn't changed a bit.

113
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,313
Oh, there they are, the Tigers.

114
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:57,692
It's my little team.

115
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,518
I played shortstop.
Of course,

116
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,113
I couldn't show
everything I had.

117
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:03,778
But... let's just say we, uh...

118
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,107
we-we did a lot of winning.

119
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:09,373
This is just, um...

120
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,195
Really just, uh...

121
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:15,294
It's so special to come back.

122
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,579
Hmm.

123
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,462
Uh, I'm sorry,

124
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,791
why is that there?

125
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:23,205
Sorry?

126
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:24,804
Who put the fucking blanket
on the bed?

127
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:26,468
Uh, R-Randy Set-Dec, I think.

128
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:27,547
Who's Randy Set-Dec?

129
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,801
He's-he's over there.

130
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,052
Randy, why?

131
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:31,474
You fucking asshole.

132
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,642
- Uh...
- Amateur fuck.

133
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,311
What just happened?

134
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,606
Samaritan's Embrace,

135
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:46,028
led by Ezekiel
but bankrolled by Vought,

136
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:47,858
has been shipping Compound V

137
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,113
to 53 hospitals
across the country

138
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:53,865
since 1971
and gift wrapping it...

139
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:59,004
...gift wrapping it

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,749
- as polio vaccine.
- Are you telling me

141
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,921
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,210
and blessing babies?

143
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,843
Butcher, can you leave God out
of this?

144
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,259
H-Hold on, hold on.
So, no hero was born?

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,890
None of them? They're all just
kids dosed with the blue shit.

146
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,098
I mean, even...

147
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,348
Even fucking Starlight.

148
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,863
Do you think...
do you think they know...

149
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,016
what really happened to 'em?

150
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,435
What about Homelander?

151
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,694
Homelander's a black hole.

152
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,776
Never had any public records
and never will.

153
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,661
However,
every single other Supe...

154
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:34,368
juiced-up lab rats.

155
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,658
My God.

156
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:36,871
I'm trying to give

157
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,460
a tremendous fucking TED Talk
here, and this...

158
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,077
Frenchie,
can you control her, please?

159
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,084
I do not control her.

160
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,088
Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

161
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,669
Well, spot on, M.M.

162
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:51,884
We got Vought for child
endangerment, drug trafficking,

163
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,885
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

164
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:58,219
Raynor's gonna love it.

165
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:59,905
You better hope she does...

166
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,605
Uh, hi.

167
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:11,796
Hughie, no!

168
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,360
No, no, no.

169
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,565
Not if you're attached
to that hand, no.

170
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,829
It's okay. Yeah.

171
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:22,579
Well, you know,
all of this, uh, it's...

172
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,423
But it's only part
of the story, no?

173
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:28,919
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

174
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,262
She's not an infant.

175
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:33,507
And she was injected
in a basement, not a hospital.

176
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,510
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

177
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:38,853
Well, your feral pixie dream
girl ain't exactly dictating

178
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,809
her fucking memoirs,
is she, Frenchie?

179
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,019
I'm feeling
she's trying to communicate.

180
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,770
I mean,
she's been doing this for...

181
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,563
Maybe that means something, huh?

182
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:48,833
Yeah, maybe they're
just fucking chicken scratches.

183
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:49,727
Let's find out.

184
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:50,855
Nah, you've been burned.

185
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,361
It's not safe out there for you.

186
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,703
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

187
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,993
Fantastique.

188
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,043
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

189
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:03,867
I'll just, uh,
keep on Starlight then, right?

190
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,667
Her phone's been tits-up
for a week.

191
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,170
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

192
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,513
No.

193
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:16,179
But I can, uh... I can check.

194
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:21,926
All right.

195
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,144
You're with me.

196
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,644
- He is?
- I am?

197
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,186
What, to the CIA lady?

198
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:30,519
No. We're gonna go
on a little detour.

199
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,776
You'll love it.

200
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,648
Come on.

201
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,909
No, I have
been working with her!

202
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:40,528
I've been fucking working
with her! I can't believe this.

203
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,536
Who the fuck are you gonna get
to replace me?

204
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:45,998
I'd like to see
what bitch that is!

205
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,419
You okay?

206
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:55,256
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

207
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,679
because she seems sweet
and a little naive

208
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:59,362
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

209
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:01,886
And then, once she's active,

210
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,350
she stabs you in the back,

211
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,600
gets you kicked out
of the house?

212
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:09,038
- I'm sorry. I don't...
- It was

213
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,822
my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

214
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:14,487
What could go wrong, I thought.

215
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:17,696
You were playing to your base.

216
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:19,841
At least I don't have to kiss

217
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,235
your ass anymore.

218
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,582
Come in.

219
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,245
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

220
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:34,053
You fired Ashley?

221
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,047
It was actually
a mutual decision.

222
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,719
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

223
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,719
and, um, we wished her well.

224
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:43,141
So, I would like you
to take this

225
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,270
in the constructive spirit
that it is intended.

226
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,228
Okay.

227
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:52,268
You are a selfish,
arrogant child.

228
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:53,694
Wow.

229
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,362
Back in Iowa,

230
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,950
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

231
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:00,357
I did.

232
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,945
She was a rebel.

233
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,370
Didn't take anyone's shit,

234
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,788
didn't play by the rules.

235
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,117
That's what you wanted to be.

236
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:08,251
That's what American heroes are.

237
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,998
But it's a myth.

238
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,540
I should know,
because I wrote it.

239
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:15,875
The truth is,

240
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,051
dozens of people in this company

241
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,050
spent hundreds of hours

242
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:23,182
to create the thing that is you.

243
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,470
I never asked for that.

244
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:28,894
Then why don't you burn
the sparkly outfit

245
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,854
and become a cop?

246
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:34,651
You want to be a superhero.

247
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,690
You want to be famous.

248
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,074
But nobody's famous alone.

249
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:44,912
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

250
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,910
show a little fucking gratitude,

251
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,792
and let us do our job?

252
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,251
No.

253
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,589
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,931
I mean,
I don't mean to be ungrateful.

255
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:05,177
But... no red carpets,

256
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,100
no reality TV,

257
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,929
and no Noxzema commercials.

258
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:13,345
And I want my old uniform back.

259
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,355
I'm gonna save people.

260
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:18,147
Then I think
we may need to reconsider

261
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,571
your position in The Seven.

262
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,700
And I think
that firing an employee

263
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,950
after she reported
sexual assault on live TV

264
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:29,833
might tank your stock price.

265
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:34,962
Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm sorry,
I don't do discretion anymore.

267
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:41,303
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

268
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

269
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,886
I just don't know
to whom you're referring.

270
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,309
Oh, I think you know.

271
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:53,098
I think you've known
for a long time.

272
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:58,233
Thank you so much for coming,
Starlight.

273
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,073
I have a lot to think about.

274
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,082
Okay.

275
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,415
I mean, you take
Tek-Knight's Knightracer?

276
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,671
Had a carbon footprint
the size of a 727.

277
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:23,803
The thing literally shot fire.

278
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,010
Thanks to me,
now he drives a hybrid.

279
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,221
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

280
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:32,351
To respect what's, what's
beautiful in the world.

281
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,561
- What's up?
- Hi.

282
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:42,608
So... everything.

283
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,401
So beautiful.

284
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,904
Good. Let's reset.

285
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,606
Trash back on the beach, please.

286
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,616
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

287
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:51,238
All right.

288
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:54,294
Um, well, we lost my dad
at a young age,

289
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,999
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

290
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,329
so, it was, uh, my older brother
Nathan who,

291
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,455
who pretty much raised me up.

292
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:02,563
And when I was three, it's like
these guys started shooting

293
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:04,257
in front of my building

294
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,087
and I outran the damn bullet.

295
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,683
That's kinda how
I figured out...

296
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:09,028
Can I, can I stop you
right there for a second?

297
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,142
What if we ixnay
the gun violence?

298
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,520
Maybe make it
a click more upbeat?

299
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,639
Yeah, yeah.

300
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:20,039
All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

301
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,233
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

302
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,324
Set. Go.

303
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,449
Nope. You're off, bro.

304
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,529
Go again.

305
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,775
Go.

306
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,286
Nope. Go.

307
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:35,657
No.

308
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:37,294
No?

309
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,750
What is going on with you, man?

310
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:45,212
Here comes the A-Train!

311
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:48,215
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

312
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,178
What? I don't, uh...

313
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,178
You guys were
in Teenage Kix together?

314
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,720
You, you heard
she passed away, yeah?

315
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,095
Yeah, they're,
they're saying it was a stroke,

316
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:59,642
but between you and me,

317
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:01,556
I think it was probably
a drug overdose.

318
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:05,895
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honor?

319
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:13,162
I haven't seen her in years,
so, you know...

320
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,383
Boy, you're really milking
this thing for all it's worth.

321
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:33,845
- Excuse me?
- This empowerment act.

322
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,177
I mean, every time
I'm on a red carpet now,

323
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:39,643
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

324
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:43,364
But, hey, as long
as you're trending, right?

325
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,146
I know that you might not
get this,

326
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,030
but it's not an act.

327
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,568
I'm just trying to be honest.

328
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,281
Okay. Yeah.

329
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,907
When I was younger,

330
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:01,502
I read your autobiography so
many times that I wore it out.

331
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,960
I had to buy a second one.

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,710
I wanted to live my life
exactly like yours.

333
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,094
Because you didn't just break
all the bones

334
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:12,552
in your right arm
stopping that school bus

335
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,512
from falling off of a bridge,

336
00:15:14,553 --> 00:15:19,223
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

337
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:22,136
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

338
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:25,265
You really stood for something.

339
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:29,227
But now...

340
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:33,156
I'm pretty sure that was just
written by the marketing guys.

341
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,285
...hunting for his own food.

342
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:44,168
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

343
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:47,457
can reach sizes
of up to 25 feet in length

344
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,632
and over 4,000 pounds.

345
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:54,011
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

346
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,680
Mon coeur.

347
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:00,516
Would you like me to change it?

348
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,322
Incroyable.

349
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:10,527
You talked to me.

350
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,836
- She talked to me.
- That's talking?

351
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,030
Well, she communicated anyway.

352
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,240
- She likes Shark Week, huh?
- I'll call BuzzFeed.

353
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,991
I wonder if she lived
by the water.

354
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,168
You know, you can't fool me.

355
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:31,629
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

356
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,591
She could be the key to it all.

357
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:36,512
- That's what you think, huh?
- No, that's not what I think.

358
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,181
Yes, you do. It torments you.
It's okay.

359
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,221
Listen, I got one word for you.

360
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,484
It's a surefire way
to solve this puzzle.

361
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:45,636
Once and for all.

362
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:46,895
Tell me.

363
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,097
Mesmer.

364
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,066
Mesmer?

365
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,936
You want help from a Supe?

366
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:55,113
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

367
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:56,953
And the enemy of your enemy...

368
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:00,738
Frenchie, what part of "you're
burned" do you not understand?

369
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,374
Oh, come on. It's a quick trip.

370
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,040
She and I will hide in the van.

371
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,499
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

372
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,378
Boom, bing? Look, I'll tell you
what I can do.

373
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,666
I can... possibly

374
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,384
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

375
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:15,422
Ah, come on.

376
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,505
Best I can do.

377
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,549
You know...

378
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,555
I've seen you eat ice cream.

379
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,597
- Oh, my God.
- Chunky Monkey, I believe.

380
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,311
- Where is this going?
- Well, you know,

381
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,311
you take a spoonful...
a chunk of fudge, perhaps.

382
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:30,613
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

383
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,317
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

384
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:34,607
you try to even it out,
which, tragically,

385
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,321
creates a corresponding divot.

386
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:39,031
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

387
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:40,912
To consume the entire pint.

388
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:43,239
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

389
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,615
But you must.

390
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,161
And I tell you why, my friend,

391
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:49,334
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

392
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,878
And she...

393
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,128
...she's out of order.

394
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,177
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

395
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,849
You don't do it anymore.

396
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:10,152
- What?
- You know that feeling you get

397
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:12,396
when you tip your chair back
too far,

398
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,569
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

399
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:16,147
Yeah?

400
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,862
You used to look like that
all day long.

401
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,452
But now look at you,

402
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:23,617
neck-deep in shit,
cool as a cucumber.

403
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,785
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

404
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:32,079
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

405
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,585
But I just... I never really got
how that's an insult?

406
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,207
They're flexible,
take a pounding,

407
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:38,607
and they're
the reason behind, like,

408
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,181
98% of my life decisions.

409
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,796
You're doing good, Hughie.

410
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:45,644
And you're a good cunt.

411
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,734
Well, here we are.

412
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,309
Church?

413
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:56,864
Seek and ye shall find, me son.

414
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,110
Come on.

415
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:02,822
Uh, some days are harder

416
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:06,834
than others, obviously, uh...

417
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:08,998
You know, the other day,

418
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:10,707
I-I wanted to talk to my friend

419
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:13,707
about all this, but I couldn't.

420
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,880
That's why this group
is-is so great.

421
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,509
It's so important.

422
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:21,006
I know it's wrong
to feel angry.

423
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,095
After all, Tek-Knight saved me.

424
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:27,637
I-I just wish he'd been

425
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,930
a-a little more gentle
with my spine.

426
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:33,814
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

427
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:36,063
Letting go. Moving on.

428
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,820
Seth, you're up.

429
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,953
Hey...
Hey, everybody.

430
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,873
Hey, Seth.

431
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,622
Uh, so I'm kind of a writer.

432
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,374
Uh, I work in marketing.

433
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,916
Uh, there's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

434
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,460
but has ice powers.

435
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:01,213
Ice Princess.

436
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:04,966
I'm not allowed to say.

437
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,679
Anyway, she, uh,
took a liking to me.

438
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,390
It was heady, man.

439
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,892
Intoxicating.

440
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,694
No one wants to fuck the writer.

441
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:18,898
Needless to say,
I fell for her, big-time.

442
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,570
What kind
of nobber falls for a Supe?

443
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:25,819
Anyway, we were, uh,
you know, being intimate,

444
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:30,124
when she climaxed and
accidentally turned into ice.

445
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,910
Just for a second,

446
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:34,373
but I was, uh,

447
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:37,964
still in there,

448
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,841
at negative 346 degrees.

449
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,469
Same temperature
as liquid nitrogen.

450
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:46,836
As you can imagine, um...

451
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,722
...it snapped off.

452
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:57,153
The crazy thing is,
I still miss her.

453
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:01,607
It's like, that's the cost
of a mortal like me

454
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:04,649
for being with a god like her.

455
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,784
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

456
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:09,451
imagine what one would do
if she found out

457
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,331
you'd been lying to her
from the get-go?

458
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,367
Excuse me.

459
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,207
You have something
you'd like to share?

460
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,168
No, no. A-Apologies.

461
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,589
Please do, uh,
continue the Ice Capades.

462
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:26,009
We don't make
jokes or judgments here.

463
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,339
Why don't you take the talking
stick and tell us your story?

464
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,215
Nah, I'm good.

465
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,433
You know, I've seen guys
like you before.

466
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:35,894
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

467
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,394
The smirk, the jokes,

468
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,225
it's all a defense mechanism.

469
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,860
But you don't have
to do that here.

470
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,857
This is a safe space.

471
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,150
I said I'm good.

472
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:48,154
Time to move on.

473
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:51,574
Go ahead, Seth.
Give him the stick.

474
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:56,497
You, back off,
or I'll shove this stick

475
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,458
where your dick used to be.

476
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,288
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

477
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:07,086
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they
shat on your mum's best china.

478
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:10,051
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

479
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:14,013
or broke your dick
just for a laugh?

480
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:17,768
Where's your fucking rage?!

481
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,269
Your self-respect?!

482
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:23,904
Sitting here
in your little share circle.

483
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,026
Having a little whinge
and a moan.

484
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,448
Fuck "letting go."

485
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:31,215
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

486
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,779
going after 'em!

487
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,831
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

488
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:41,075
Supes are all the same.

489
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:42,834
Every fucking one of 'em.

490
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,719
Uh, he's, um...

491
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,591
Sorry.

492
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,077
Oh, Ms. Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

493
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,151
Yeah, I'm running late.
Can you walk with me?

494
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,476
Yeah, sure. Hey, look,
I brought a little present

495
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,482
- for your little guy.
- Ah.

496
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,544
Never, uh, too young to start
saving the world, right?

497
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:11,898
I'm gonna need you
to make a public apology.

498
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:15,406
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from The Seven.

499
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,870
- What?
- We are going to be stationing you

500
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,000
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

501
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:22,918
Okay, okay, look, I-I know,
I know, I know my brain wasn't

502
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,627
in the right place,
but, but my heart was.

503
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,047
And it's just that,
that damn Oceanland.

504
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:28,939
- They wouldn't let me...
- This is not about the dead dolphin.

505
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,343
This is about Starlight.

506
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,051
Starlight?
What are you...

507
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:33,591
What about Starlight?

508
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:34,925
Everybody seems to want to know

509
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:36,759
who she was referencing
in that speech,

510
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:38,724
and it is not going away.

511
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:42,095
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

512
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:44,313
some of the other women,
speak up.

513
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:47,074
- So we need to get ahead of it.
- Okay.

514
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,686
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

515
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,904
but can't you just...

516
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,914
you know, handle it?
Like, like you do?

517
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:58,407
This is the way
we are handling things now.

518
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:04,754
I'm in full support of women

519
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,091
and their ongoing bravery
in speaking out.

520
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm sorry...
let me start that over.

521
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

522
00:24:15,843 --> 00:24:17,803
Fuck, I'm sorry.

523
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:19,175
Yeah, let's just cut.
I'm sorry.

524
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:20,642
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

525
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:24,022
Starlight,
I hope you can forgive me.

526
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,730
- Harder to sell.
- To sell it. Yeah.

527
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,414
- Just a little harder.
- Perfect. Let's do that.

528
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:29,608
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

529
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:31,729
by listening. Okay.

530
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:34,026
I realize that my behavior

531
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,160
has caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

532
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:40,988
and I sincerely apologize
for this.

533
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,785
Though at the time I believed

534
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,369
that our encounter
was consensual,

535
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:47,464
I now realize that, um,
I misread the moment...

536
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,960
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

537
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,562
It's my first, uh, movie
with the, uh...

538
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:54,757
in the Vought Cinematic
Universe, uh, the VCU.

539
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,429
New York. The hearts

540
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,217
of seven million men and women
beat inside this city.

541
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:02,602
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

542
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,980
and read their minds.

543
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,517
This man is the rapist.

544
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,526
There are no secrets from me.

545
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,728
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

546
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,539
Okay.
"There are no secrets from me."

547
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:53,403
- There are no secrets from me.
- There are no secrets from me.

548
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,277
Hey.

549
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,530
What number am I thinking of?

550
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:02,202
867?

551
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,371
Fucking amazing.

552
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,500
This guy's fucking amazing.

553
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:09,707
So, what am I thinking of?

554
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:13,751
I'm thinking the same thing.

555
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:15,415
Cool.

556
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:18,513
- Now, why don't I put this down.
- Okay.

557
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,089
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

558
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:22,604
- Thank-thank you.
- Yeah.

559
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:24,717
- Mr. Mesmer.
- Ah, just-just Mesmer.

560
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,064
No "mister" necessary.

561
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,518
- You know, I'm a big fan, man.
- Thanks.

562
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,120
- Weren't you in Teenage Kix with A-Train?
- Yep.

563
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:32,364
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's
really blown up, hasn't he?

564
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:33,936
- Yeah.
- He's doing his thing.

565
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,626
Yeah, he's great.
I'm-I'm really happy for him.

566
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

567
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,073
You a fan of the show?

568
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,321
Oh, nah, man.
I've never seen it.

569
00:26:41,364 --> 00:26:43,784
- Okay.
- You know what I'm a fan of?

570
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:45,865
Your insider trading.

571
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,723
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

572
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:53,457
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

573
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,711
I mean, Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

574
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:58,263
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

575
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,797
Who the fuck are you?

576
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:04,053
Why don't you take a peep
and see?

577
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:13,147
How do you know about Cleo?

578
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,777
There are no secrets from me.

579
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:19,647
Well, I work for Child Services.

580
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:23,244
My colleague Tina,
she owes me a favor.

581
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:27,031
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

582
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,696
Cut the shit.

583
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:30,664
I lost custody three years ago.

584
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:31,974
Nobody believes
in second chances

585
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,958
for fuckups like me.

586
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,184
She's waiting on you.

587
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:49,807
Tina. Hey.

588
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:51,743
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

589
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,687
Good to see you, too.

590
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,018
Five minutes.
Next time you owe me.

591
00:27:56,063 --> 00:27:57,773
I do.

592
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:59,775
Hey, Cleo.

593
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:04,196
You remember your old man?

594
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:06,738
Hi, Charles.

595
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,919
I'm-I'm sorry that, uh...

596
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:28,144
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

597
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:31,138
Would that be okay?

598
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,142
I guess.

599
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:35,564
Okay, Cleo.

600
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:38,153
We got to get back.

601
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:40,858
- Bye.
- Hey, uh...

602
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:50,081
I-I just...

603
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,237
I just want to know
you don't hate me.

604
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:56,205
I don't really know you.

605
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:04,804
Hey, wait, um...

606
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:10,222
So you can know me
a little better.

607
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:13,392
I don't have a DVD player.

608
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,443
Bye.

609
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,358
Thanks again.
I'll call you next week.

610
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,398
Okay. You all right?

611
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,740
I can see her every month?

612
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:32,122
One hour, supervised.

613
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,739
You clean?

614
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,746
- I-I can be.
- Good.

615
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:38,708
Who do you want me to read?

616
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:42,881
What are we doing here?

617
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:52,137
My wife, Becca,
used to hum the Spice Girls.

618
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:54,809
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

619
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,559
All day long,

620
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,100
walking around the house,
humming.

621
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:01,145
She was happy.

622
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:05,608
Now, fuck know why
she was happy with me, but...

623
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:08,571
she was happy.

624
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:27,628
Homelander raped her.

625
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:36,638
Jesus.

626
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:44,065
I-I'm sorry.

627
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:56,659
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

628
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,924
I know this
'cause she got tagged

629
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:02,916
in that security camera
right there.

630
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,763
She sat here for three hours.

631
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:16,181
Didn't move a muscle.

632
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:23,768
Then she just got up
and walked away.

633
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:32,197
That was eight years ago.

634
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:35,739
And nobody's seen her since.

635
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:41,746
Either Homelander killed her

636
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,789
or she killed herself.
Same difference.

637
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,092
You see,

638
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:56,104
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

639
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:03,142
You and me,
we're in this together.

640
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:08,441
For Robin...

641
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,482
and Becca.

642
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:17,834
That is why
you can't allow yourself

643
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:21,367
to be distracted
by another bird.

644
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,670
Especially not a Supe.

645
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:37,926
Just remember...

646
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,934
...who your friends

647
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:45,935
and who your enemies are.

648
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:14,922
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

649
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:21,354
Look, I heard what happened.

650
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:26,144
I am so, so sorry.

651
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:28,685
What kind of place
did you grow up in?

652
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,559
Well, I moved around a lot,

653
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:32,816
so, uh, it was
a bunch of condos.

654
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:35,318
So, what if I took you
to a house

655
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:39,201
you'd never seen before,
full of photos

656
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,490
of parents you never met,

657
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,913
toys you never played with,

658
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:46,963
Hardy Boy books
that you never read?

659
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:51,087
And then I asked you

660
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:55,256
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

661
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:59,301
How would that make you feel?

662
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:01,853
I wouldn't like that.

663
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,898
I'm really sorry
about the blanket.

664
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,767
It never should have been there,

665
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:14,024
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

666
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:19,487
But right now...

667
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,240
we need to finish that tour

668
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,874
and to show how down-to-earth

669
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:28,461
and ready to serve you are.

670
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:31,667
And I need you
to tell the mother story.

671
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,589
Please.

672
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,343
Please do it for me.

673
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,719
It was actually my mom
who dragged me along

674
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:48,475
to my first
Little League practice,

675
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,387
and, uh, pretty soon after that,

676
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,646
I-I just loved the game

677
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,267
more than anything else
in the world.

678
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:55,274
So every year

679
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:57,856
she would bake me
a birthday cake

680
00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:59,951
in the shape
of a baseball diamond.

681
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:04,327
And... oh, I got to tell you,
it was perfect.

682
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,986
Perfect.

683
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:09,615
Everything, down to
the last minute details.

684
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:13,633
Just like her.

685
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:18,587
Cut. Perfect. So great.

686
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,840
- So we're done?
- Uh, yes.

687
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,593
Great.

688
00:35:35,314 --> 00:35:37,654
So...

689
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:40,531
she can't talk or won't talk?

690
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,859
That's what
you're gonna tell us.

691
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,664
Anything in particular
you want to know?

692
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:45,759
- Everything there is to know.
- Well, that narrows it down.

693
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:47,743
Mon coeur.

694
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:49,745
Will you come?

695
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,787
Have a seat.

696
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,343
It's okay. Have a seat.

697
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,221
Gentle.

698
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,011
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

699
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:34,826
- Jesus fucking...
- Goddamn it.

700
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,793
- Relax!
- No.

701
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:38,044
Everyone relax!

702
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:39,437
- Just-just go walk it off.
- Walk it off?

703
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:41,131
She broke my fucking wrist!

704
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,221
She didn't intend any harm.

705
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:44,547
Oh, could have fooled me.

706
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,637
Get out!
I'm going to the hospital.

707
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:48,905
Not till we get
what we came for, Mesmer.

708
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:50,759
- Fuck you! The session's over!
- Sit down!

709
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:54,175
Okay, listen.

710
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:56,146
I was a field medic.

711
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:58,686
Don't look at her.
Look at me.

712
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,070
I can patch you up better

713
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:01,977
than any of those
oxy junkies in the E.R.,

714
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:04,105
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

715
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,870
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

716
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:12,288
No, I don't have
a goddamn splint!

717
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:16,456
It's Butcher.

718
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:17,918
Be quiet.

719
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,884
- Butcher.
- Where are you?

720
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,379
Shake Shack.

721
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:23,881
Really?

722
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:26,512
Fucking magic, that place.

723
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,300
- What'd you get?
- ShackBurger,

724
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:30,353
uh, cheese fries,

725
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:33,217
- cookie dough concrete.
- Sounds good.

726
00:37:33,265 --> 00:37:34,555
Does it taste like lies?

727
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,020
I got your phone linked

728
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,939
to my
Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

729
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:40,728
Now, where the fuck are you?

730
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:52,696
Yes, this...
this is a superhero.

731
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,123
- This is good.
- Okay.

732
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:57,752
- We just keep...?
- Yeah, yeah.

733
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,749
Well, people are
always asking me, you know,

734
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:02,751
what it's like to live
with my coworkers, and...

735
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:05,134
the truth is,
we're all great friends,

736
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:07,842
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

737
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,473
uh...

738
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,350
Oh, hey, Elena.

739
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,136
- Hey.
- This is my friend.

740
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,850
I left a pile of messages for...

741
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,850
Yeah, that's what we are.
We're friends.

742
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,642
Can you ask them
to turn that off, please?

743
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,595
I'm gonna need
five minutes, okay?

744
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:24,191
Yeah, we're, uh,
doing a reality show.

745
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:27,823
- That's invasive.
- What are you even doing here?

746
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:30,741
I would never
turn up to your work.

747
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,951
- I was worried about you.
- I had a bad night.

748
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,951
This Teflon shit, it might work
for everybody else,

749
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,214
- but not with me.
- Will you keep your voice down?

750
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,787
Just tell me what's going on.

751
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:43,592
Did you ever think that, um...

752
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:48,376
...maybe I was just looking
for a hookup?

753
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:49,933
I know you think you know me...

754
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,717
- I used to.
- Yeah, used to. I've changed.

755
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:55,012
Yeah.

756
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:56,385
I still know you.

757
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,351
- Oh, come on.
- Afraid to be seen with me.

758
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:01,482
Afraid to ask for help.

759
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,980
Just... afraid.

760
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,491
Are you filming, Courtenay?

761
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:20,206
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

762
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:21,787
We cut... we cut a while ago.

763
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:23,462
We're setting up a shot
for later.

764
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,630
- Fucking bitch.
- B-roll on the building.

765
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,419
All right, you can cut it, guys.

766
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:29,382
It's okay.

767
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:30,513
Everything is okay.

768
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,428
Gentlemen.

769
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:41,271
Wow. Mesmer.

770
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,020
Hello.

771
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,771
Big fan.

772
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,063
Be with you in a minute.

773
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:49,816
Well, now we got to kill him.

774
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,360
No, we don't have to kill him.

775
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:53,363
Look, we made a deal
with the guy.

776
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:56,235
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

777
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:57,873
He's just a dad with his kid.

778
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,869
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

779
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,871
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

780
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:04,583
- You know better than that.
- Sometimes you get further

781
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,415
with people
by treating them like people.

782
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:12,757
Nice decor.

783
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,339
'80s serial killer.
Love it.

784
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:18,385
All right, then,
let's get cracking.

785
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:36,621
There's a camp in a...
in a jungle.

786
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:42,752
She's a soldier.

787
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:49,035
There's a-a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

788
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:51,046
Two-headed snake?

789
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:52,798
Like...?

790
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,509
Yeah.

791
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:56,549
- With red rays behind it?
- What does that mean?

792
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:58,643
It's the flag of the
Shining Light Liberation Army.

793
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,009
Frenchie...

794
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:02,515
you're dating a terrorist.

795
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:06,193
Is this true?

796
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:09,002
Ah.

797
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,560
There must be
more to all of this.

798
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:27,348
She can't be a terrorist.

799
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:29,078
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

800
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,022
Okay, so they smuggle in

801
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:33,022
a top-shelf extremist recruit

802
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,034
and pump her up with Compound V.

803
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,294
And then,
when she's good and ready,

804
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:37,503
they cut her loose
to wreak havoc.

805
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:38,777
- She wouldn't.
- Wait.

806
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

807
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:43,664
'Cause the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

808
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,040
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

809
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:48,207
Is with Sergeant
Fucking Homelander.

810
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,916
Got to let the cunts
in the army now.

811
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,627
Those fuckers are creating
super villains.

812
00:42:53,668 --> 00:42:56,298
And maybe there's more of 'em,
God knows how many.

813
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,878
Holy shit.

814
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,513
Okay, this is a clusterfuck,
even for us.

815
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,300
No, listen to me, okay? Maybe
that's what they want her to be.

816
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,465
But that's not who she is.

817
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:07,394
- That's not what she wants.
- And you know this

818
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:09,022
'cause she bends
your fucking ear off?

819
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:11,099
She saved my life!
She's not bad.

820
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:13,024
She just want to go home.

821
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:15,823
She's a fucking Supe,
just like the rest.

822
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:18,987
How many times do I have
to fucking say it, eh?

823
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:25,244
Mon coeur,
I know you understand me.

824
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:27,123
Please. Please.

825
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,830
Tell them who you are.

826
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,250
Tell them what I see.

827
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:42,184
No.

828
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:13,576
The drawings are, uh,
palm trees in front of the moon.

829
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:15,833
It's where she grew up.

830
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:20,924
They killed her parents.

831
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:23,174
They kidnapped her
and her brother.

832
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:25,336
Forced them to be soldiers.

833
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,726
No, Kimiko...

834
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,147
You eat it.

835
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,606
She just wants to go back and
get her brother out of there.

836
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:44,027
Her name's Kimiko.

837
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,661
Kimiko.

838
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,671
Bonjour, Kimiko.

839
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:07,758
All right, take her back
to the safe house.

840
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,180
Where you headed?

841
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:13,062
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

842
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:16,229
We've got more than enough
to get the Feds on board now.

843
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:23,107
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

844
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,611
and I'll cut your hands off and
shove 'em so far up your ass,

845
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,115
your fingers'll give us a little
wave out your throat, yeah?

846
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:36,502
Fuck off, wanker.

847
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:42,171
Some controversial news today

848
00:45:42,212 --> 00:45:43,731
as the Deep went public
with his apology.

849
00:45:43,755 --> 00:45:45,465
I realize that my behavior

850
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:48,217
caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

851
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:50,889
and I sincerely apologize.

852
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,680
Fuck you, fish dick!

853
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:58,187
Keep speaking your truth!

854
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:00,558
I'm in full support of women

855
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:03,015
and their ongoing bravery...

856
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:06,276
Never got the point of these.

857
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,279
To me, they always looked
like Granddad's bollocks

858
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:09,531
flopping in the wind.

859
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:14,695
Do you have
the Compound V or not?

860
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:17,164
I've got the Compound V...

861
00:46:17,205 --> 00:46:20,625
proof that Vought's injected
babies right across the country,

862
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:24,127
and... something
even more fucking diabolical.

863
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,670
Worse than dosing babies?

864
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:27,634
Let's just say,
with these cunts,

865
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:29,634
there ain't no rock bottom.

866
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:32,216
Let's get it to the lab...

867
00:46:33,054 --> 00:46:34,604
Not so fast.

868
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:39,515
First things first, eh?

869
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,687
A list of your demands.

870
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:45,071
How in character.

871
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,568
Exorbitant salary.
Same for your team.

872
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,240
Office space,

873
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:50,739
in the Flatiron Building,
no less.

874
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,780
Security clearance.
Indemnity clause.

875
00:46:52,824 --> 00:46:54,534
Legal protection.

876
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:56,946
A formal guarantee that
Homelander will be prosecuted

877
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:59,115
under the full extent
of the law.

878
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,080
Any of that a problem?

879
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,335
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

880
00:47:04,377 --> 00:47:07,047
And, uh, while they hash it out,

881
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,668
you and I go forward
on good faith.

882
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:13,845
I'm fresh out of good faith.

883
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:15,347
Now, you and I both know

884
00:47:15,388 --> 00:47:17,598
that you can rubber-stamp
all of that.

885
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,350
So what's it gonna be...

886
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:20,812
Deputy Director?

887
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,272
I can give you...

888
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:26,073
everything you want
on this list...

889
00:47:26,107 --> 00:47:27,857
Except?

890
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,901
Except Homelander.

891
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,492
You know what he's done.

892
00:47:49,255 --> 00:47:50,915
I sympathize.

893
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:53,296
I really do.

894
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,223
- But it's suicide.
- Yeah, well,

895
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:58,101
- that's a small fucking price to pay, isn't it?
- Not for you.

896
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,889
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

897
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:02,894
You're fucking scared.

898
00:48:02,936 --> 00:48:04,846
I'm fucking terrified.

899
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:06,896
And you should be, too.

900
00:48:13,446 --> 00:48:14,446
Butcher!

901
00:48:15,657 --> 00:48:17,657
Butcher!

902
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,310
This small-town girl-next-door

903
00:48:39,347 --> 00:48:41,097
wanted to change the world.

904
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:42,851
Since when did hopeful

905
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:45,812
and naive become
the same thing?

906
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:48,234
But the world had other plans.

907
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:49,943
Starlight,

908
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:50,943
I hope you can forgive me.

909
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:52,744
Battered and beaten,

910
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:55,777
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

911
00:48:55,822 --> 00:49:00,872
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

912
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,040
Witness her power.

913
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,999
Hear her truth.

914
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:07,209
And I'm done taking
any more shit.

915
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,380
Watch her stand up

916
00:49:09,419 --> 00:49:11,799
and fight back for all of us.

917
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:15,338
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

918
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:18,683
The house always wins.

919
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:25,483
I'm sorry.

920
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:38,757
While little is known about...

921
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,083
...the blacktip reef sharks
can be found mating

922
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,539
in the summer months

923
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,869
off the coast
of Northern Australia.

924
00:49:46,915 --> 00:49:50,335
I know you want
to go back to your brother.

925
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,088
But the people
who did this to you...

926
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,603
you know, they might be doing it
to others.

927
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:02,717
We can use your help
stopping them.

928
00:50:10,897 --> 00:50:12,857
It's your choice.

929
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:17,489
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

930
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:20,618
And is following her closely

931
00:50:20,657 --> 00:50:22,947
in hopes of securing a mate.

932
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:25,162
When the female returns
his feelings,

933
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:27,123
she will swim slowly

934
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:29,213
in a sinusoidal pattern...

935
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,505
No.

936
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:39,507
Baby, why you want
to do me like that?

937
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,403
'Cause if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

938
00:50:41,427 --> 00:50:43,030
then I'm gonna be one behind...

939
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:44,740
and we're not gonna be able
to binge-watch together.

940
00:50:44,764 --> 00:50:46,158
Just-just hold off

941
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:47,812
until I get home.

942
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,770
Uhp, there's a fight
in the yard, baby.

943
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:52,441
I got to go. All right.

944
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
How'd it go with Raynor?

945
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,480
No dice.

946
00:50:56,526 --> 00:50:57,896
What?

947
00:50:57,944 --> 00:51:00,414
Said she got cold feet.

948
00:51:00,446 --> 00:51:02,526
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

949
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:05,953
Yeah, I laid it all out,
even the sample of V.

950
00:51:05,994 --> 00:51:07,954
Said she couldn't
fucking authorize

951
00:51:07,996 --> 00:51:09,706
that kind of action
against Vought.

952
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:12,037
Too much of a risk.

953
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:14,713
Hmm. Did she?

954
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:16,592
Fucking spineless cunt.

955
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,589
So we are royally fucked.

956
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,550
No, we ain't.

957
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:23,682
Fuck 'em.

958
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,680
We don't need 'em.

959
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:30,102
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

960
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:33,563
We'll take down Vought
ourselves. Yeah?

961
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,484
Yeah.

962
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:39,572
Where's Hughie?

963
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:43,492
This is Tina Mitchell,

964
00:51:43,531 --> 00:51:45,491
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

965
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,543
Leave a message.

966
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,617
Tina, um, it's Mesmer.

967
00:51:49,662 --> 00:51:51,462
You met me earlier.

968
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,171
Um...

969
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:59,009
Cleo, uh, didn't really
want to see me today.

970
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,167
She was just being polite.

971
00:52:03,384 --> 00:52:05,934
I'm pretty good at reading stuff
like that, so...

972
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:09,563
Um, you-you don't have
to-to call me,

973
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,269
um, or any of that anymore.

974
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:15,521
Just, um... it's-it's okay.

975
00:52:15,563 --> 00:52:18,823
Just... just... please...

976
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:21,278
uh, look after her.

977
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Thank you.

978
00:52:33,915 --> 00:52:36,535
I'm sorry.
The, uh, elevator was out.

979
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:40,804
Um, you...
you probably don't remember,

980
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:42,338
but, um, we've met before.

981
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:46,388
Oh, I...
I would never try and read you.

982
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:47,847
Let's be clear.

983
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:50,057
I don't know you,

984
00:52:50,098 --> 00:52:52,098
and I don't want to.

985
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,728
A-Train said
that you have some information.

986
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,400
Yeah, we, um... we go back
to the Teenage Kix days.

987
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:00,609
- We-we still keep in touch.
- Oh, golly gee shucks.

988
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,610
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

989
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:07,493
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

990
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:09,662
Yeah.

991
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,620
He said you were looking
for a, um, French guy...

992
00:53:13,663 --> 00:53:17,673
and a black guy...

993
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,588
a skinny white guy,

994
00:53:19,627 --> 00:53:21,627
British guy.

995
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:24,632
Where are these from?

996
00:53:24,674 --> 00:53:28,514
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

997
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:30,893
I know there's no reward,
but I was hoping

998
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,640
you could put in a word for me
at Vought?

999
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:35,773
I'll take any posting.

1000
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,810
Uh, low five-figures
would be fine.

1001
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,690
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

1002
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:01,039
Oh, that's my phone.

1003
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,724
I mean, I don't remember,

1004
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,586
but my mom said
that when I was born,

1005
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:10,344
I almost blinded the doctor.

1006
00:54:10,386 --> 00:54:13,096
So, I had powers from the start.

1007
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:14,559
Why?

1008
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,689
No, no, I'm just, uh, curious.

1009
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:19,727
Mm.

1010
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,730
Do you mind if we just...

1011
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:23,822
not talk
about hero stuff tonight?

1012
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:25,818
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

1013
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,490
Yeah. It's an understatement.

1014
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:31,159
You know,

1015
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,829
there's this beach
in the Bahamas

1016
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:36,408
where the sand is pink,

1017
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:38,964
like, cotton-candy pink.

1018
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:40,078
What's it called?

1019
00:54:40,124 --> 00:54:41,174
Pink Sands.

1020
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:44,503
It's not
the most creative name,

1021
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:47,295
but... let's just go.

1022
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,300
Yeah. No, I can, uh...

1023
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:51,182
learn how to play
the steel drum.

1024
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,099
You can get cornrows.

1025
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:54,347
How about tonight?

1026
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:55,678
Book that ticket.

1027
00:54:58,851 --> 00:55:01,651
Are...
are we talking about this?

1028
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:04,818
I don't know. I...

1029
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:06,857
I just know that,

1030
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,861
for me, New York has been such

1031
00:55:09,904 --> 00:55:12,994
an endless shit show.

1032
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:15,242
Except for you.

1033
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:19,713
Somehow, in the middle
of it all...

1034
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
...you found me.

1035
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:54,703
Hughie.

1036
00:55:57,076 --> 00:55:59,196
I thought that was you.

1037
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:01,205
Ha. Oh.

1038
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:02,617
Oh, I apologize.

1039
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,075
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1040
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,495
No.

1041
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:07,173
Hi, I'm Annie.

1042
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:08,841
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

1043
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:10,419
Ah, boy, you really...

1044
00:56:10,464 --> 00:56:12,514
You have a lot of friends
showing up here.

1045
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,300
Yeah.

1046
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:15,723
Seems like it.

1047
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:19,221
You're that new girl
in The Seven, ain't you?

1048
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:20,765
Guilty.

1049
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:22,848
Wow. It is a pleasure
to meet you.

1050
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:24,903
And I must say
how marvelous it is

1051
00:56:24,937 --> 00:56:27,437
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

1052
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:29,151
- You know what I mean?
- Mm.

1053
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:32,451
You know,
i-if I'm perfectly honest,

1054
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:35,356
Translucent's always been
my favorite.

1055
00:56:35,406 --> 00:56:37,156
What's he up to?

1056
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,489
I think he's on a mission.

1057
00:56:39,535 --> 00:56:41,945
Huh. Yeah, I think
I read that, actually.

1058
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:43,866
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

1059
00:56:43,914 --> 00:56:46,714
I do hope he's all right.

1060
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,382
You know what?

1061
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,380
I'm gonna go...
get us a pitcher.

1062
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:53,762
- Ah.
- Billy, you like...

1063
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:55,179
Let me guess.
Guinness?

1064
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:57,297
I like what you like.

1065
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:59,635
All right. Be right back.

1066
00:57:01,182 --> 00:57:03,932
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

1067
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:06,396
She's quite tasty
up close and personal.

1068
00:57:06,437 --> 00:57:08,517
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

1069
00:57:08,564 --> 00:57:10,524
I thought
we had an understanding.

1070
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:11,896
We do. We do.

1071
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:14,742
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

1072
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:17,029
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

1073
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:20,083
you've got your tongue halfway
down the opposition's throat.

1074
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:22,367
She is not the opposition.

1075
00:57:24,246 --> 00:57:26,866
She's a good person, okay?

1076
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,206
I mean, she could help us.

1077
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,130
- Help us?
- Yeah.

1078
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:34,968
And what do you think
she's gonna do

1079
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:37,967
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

1080
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:41,637
When she finds out?

1081
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:48,727
Give her my best.

1082
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Where'd your friend go?
