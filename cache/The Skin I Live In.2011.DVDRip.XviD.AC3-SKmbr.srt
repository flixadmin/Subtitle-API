1
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:30,048
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,847
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,385
Open it.

4
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,763
Take this.

5
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,427
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,424
Yes.

7
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,470
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,764
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:29,970
OK.

10
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:36,426
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,889
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,517
Yeah.

13
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,008
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,509
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough. 

15
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:31,101
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:32,472
A face with features...

17
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,309
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,928
I have participated in

19
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,507
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:43,133
 carried out in the world...

21
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:46,675
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,132
Good...

23
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:52,798
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:56,514
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:56,602 --> 00:05:02,717
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,558
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:53,389
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,386
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,472
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:32,549
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,302
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,597
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,477
Your skin is softer than I thought.

34
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,972
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,347
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:49,592
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:51,767
In any case...

38
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,179
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,136
Here it is...

40
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,972
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,643
Thank you.

42
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,393
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:29,597
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,391
I was hasty.

45
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,515
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,351
No.

47
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,552
And now?

48
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,802
No.

49
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,517
Now!

50
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,184
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,597
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:58,716
in recent years.

53
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,513
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,891
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,304
No.

56
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,515
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:11,974
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,132
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control... 

59
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:19,096
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,180
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,266
and the results...

62
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:27,134
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,052
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,140
they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,017
in human mammals.

66
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:38,591
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,303
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,640
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,559
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:50,635
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,475
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:56,099
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,850
and it smells different.

74
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,600
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,256
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,924
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,016
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,726
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,929
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:15,011
Excuse me.

81
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,306
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:21,847
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,725
By mutating it.

84
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,011
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:27,760
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:32,264
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,933
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,721
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,600
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,178
You're insane!

91
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,635
You know the application
of transgenetic therapy...

92
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,309
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,514
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:51,299
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:54,471
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:57,849
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:01,716
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,178
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,259
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:07,722
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,226
Don't go on!

102
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,431
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,388
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,674
But even so...

105
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,134
I must forbid you from 
investigating further...

106
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,259
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,933
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,974
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,054
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:35,429
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,014
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,804
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:41,842
I remember...

114
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,850
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:47,217
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:49,136
And it still is.

117
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,634
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,015
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:58,966
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:03,808
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,684
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,383
I don't know.

123
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,552
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,434
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,049
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,598
What do you mean?

127
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,304
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,143
No.

129
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,096
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,143
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,844
Yes...

132
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:36,557
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,884
And now what?

134
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,102
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,057
and smoke it.

136
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:52,349
I mean us.

137
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,803
Me.

138
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,010
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:01,301
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:02,507
When?

141
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,138
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,767
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,390
Live together.

144
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:14,765
Live together?

145
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,142
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,394
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,639
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,095
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,018
That's it!

150
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,184
Here.

151
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,305
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,267
I'm yours.

153
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,592
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:58,011
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:58,435 --> 00:21:00,260
Did I say that?

156
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,097
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,469
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,268
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,095
In this pocket.

160
00:21:55,394 --> 00:22:02,511
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,721
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,307
If I'd been here, 
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,930
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,093
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,972
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:24,381
No.

167
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,678
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:32,761
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,094
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,592
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,600
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:45,675
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,009
You're sick.

174
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,684
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,932
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:56,388
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:57,894 --> 00:23:01,555
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,892
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:08,769
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,267
What do you want?

181
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:51,341
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,674
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,097
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,054
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,803
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,849
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,177
Zeca!

188
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,683
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,552
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,095
Open the door!

191
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:31,933
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:36,760
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:41,642
Little tiger!

194
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:44,139
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,059
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,053
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:53,759
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,226
How did you find us?

199
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,434
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:26,344
He was giving a...

201
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,761
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:31,759
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,889
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,266
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,471
It smells good.
I'm hungry.

206
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:42,893
Brute!

207
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,224
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,059
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:25:57,185 --> 00:26:00,349
<i>and the daring robbery committed
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,384
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,798
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:06,389
<i>and today we have the first images 
recorded by one...

213
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:12,633
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:16,217
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:23,888
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,267
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:28,227 --> 00:26:30,514
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,925
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,596
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,558
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:41,554
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,926
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,476
Hide you here?

225
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,632
Not a chance.

226
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:49,596
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:51,676
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,342
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,183
Robert?

230
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,301
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,469
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,102
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,559
after what you did?

234
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:08,758
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:14,759
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,174
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,014
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:24,184
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,095
Even better.

240
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,764
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,018
Where are you going?

242
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,555
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:43,516
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:10,966
What's this?

245
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,643
It's a film!

246
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:14,511
Go away!

247
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:41,966
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:44,261
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,976
Mom...

250
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,511
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,139
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:58,305
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:28:58,394 --> 00:28:59,934
How could it be her?

254
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,010
Get out of here!

255
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:03,553
Keep away!

256
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,642
Marilia?

257
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,882
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,928
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,974
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,683
<i>Marilia?

261
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:24,511
Marilia!

262
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,768
There.

263
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:18,056
Who is it?

264
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:20,141
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,059
I can't.

266
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:25,100
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,933
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,472
- I don't know. 
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,716
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:05,140
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,265
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,594
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:12,350
No, where is it?

274
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:16,764
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,514
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,885
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,965
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,965
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,549
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:51,013
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:56,631
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,346
It all fit before.

283
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:48,642
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:50,923
No.

285
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:54,598
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,393
He saved me.

287
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:05,009
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,140
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,433
You're saying that...

290
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,260
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:14,471
No!

292
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:18,717
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,767
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,465
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:26,517
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,848
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:32,767
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,226
Great.

299
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,430
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:42,259
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:43,809
Yes.

302
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,883
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,974
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,433
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:59,685
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,971
Listen...

307
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:07,675
What?

308
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:10,055
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:14,054
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,224
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,642
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:26,434
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:28,684
It's very big.

314
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,559
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,060
Yes...

316
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,727
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:40,551
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,844
Kill her!

319
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:58,511
Kill them both!

320
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:31,349
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,926
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,140
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,178
Yes.

324
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,470
They're brothers...

325
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:47,598
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,675
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:56,389
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:37:57,477 --> 00:38:02,265
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:07,716
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,223
It's my fault.

331
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:21,968
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:25,185
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,597
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:32,759
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,393
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:39,435 --> 00:38:43,097
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:48,095
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:52,428
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:58,222
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:04,180
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,351
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:17,974
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,975
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:25,717
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,677
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:32,305
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:37,055
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:39,883
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,551
But she...

350
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:52,847
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,299
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:08,220
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:10,220
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:16,927
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,466
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:24,264
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,643
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:33,677
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,514
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,642
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:46,891
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:53,842
One day...

363
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:58,724
when she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:03,973
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:08,382
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:13,394
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:20,352
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:23,095
And it was...

369
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:27,218
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:06,769
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,351
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,178
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:26,174
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,554
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,883
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:50,475
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,552
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,721
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:04,800
Through the window.

380
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:47,635
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,261
Did you pray?

382
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:52,599
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,682
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:41,053
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:42,767
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:44,227 --> 00:44:47,225
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,885
As you wish.

388
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:55,392
But hold me!

389
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:04,882
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,636
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:10,643
Thank you!

392
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:28,514
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:38,056
Sleep, my love.

394
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,260
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:34,847
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:37,554
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:42,596
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,132
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:54,761
Your daughter is getting on well
with my nieces.

400
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,219
She seems much better...

401
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,096
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:03,802
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:07,224
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:22,636
To you!

405
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,596
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,267
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,220
Excuse me.

408
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,219
Norma!

409
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:44,893
Norma!

410
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,052
Norma!

411
00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:48,892
Norma!

412
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,636
Norma!

413
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:54,300
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:01,716
There, there!

415
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,007
What about this one?

416
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:12,299
Yes, but...

417
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:13,555
no.

418
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:14,799
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:17,098
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:17,185 --> 00:52:19,639
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:22,216
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:23,845
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,351
No stripes.

424
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,101
Something graphic?

425
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:40,846
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:42,849
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:46,052
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:51,097
Cristina...

429
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,093
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:54,185 --> 00:52:56,093
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:57,768
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:52:57,935 --> 00:53:00,506
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:04,218
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,343
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,183
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,176
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,556
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:15,803
In any case...

439
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:19,634
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:21,806
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:27,051
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:29,393
I'm off.

443
00:53:29,852 --> 00:53:31,226
Where to?

444
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:32,726
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,054
How come?

446
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:35,674
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:38,304
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,549
Were you invited?

449
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:41,718
Jorge knows one of the nieces.

450
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,552
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:46,841
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:49,258
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,513
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:54,143
Hello.

455
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:57,598
My wife has left us...

456
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:00,221
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,265
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,184
Well...

459
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:08,598
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:14,808
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:16,552
They're very nice.

462
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:18,884
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:22,598
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:23,592
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:23,685 --> 00:54:25,095
It certainly is.

466
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:26,559
But...

467
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,264
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:31,432
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,517
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:34,602 --> 00:54:36,308
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:39,475
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:28,174
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:31,018
What a party!

474
00:55:31,144 --> 00:55:32,601
Fresh air!

475
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:37,385
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,267
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:43,144 --> 00:55:44,720
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:50,642
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:54,139
All the better, right?

480
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,803
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:10,928
Stoned?

482
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,391
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:15,892
Yes.

484
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:18,509
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,309
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:25,676
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:27,427
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,264
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:31,673
Shit!

490
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,766
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,221
High?

492
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:37,095
Yes.

493
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:44,009
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:46,218
No. Are you?

495
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:49,138
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:10,970
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:16,894 --> 00:57:18,470
And this jacket!

498
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:23,888
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,091
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:30,352 --> 00:57:31,631
Wait.

501
00:57:32,644 --> 00:57:34,350
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:14,644 --> 00:58:16,385
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,809
and different.

504
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:23,683
I'm different too.

505
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,134
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:27,935 --> 00:58:29,014
No.

507
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:31,140
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:31,227 --> 00:58:32,636
I don't know.

509
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,842
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:38,346
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:40,391
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,260
with all my affection.

513
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:47,054
No!

514
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,973
Shut up!

515
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,592
Stop!

516
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:34,434
Cristina...

517
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,807
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:38,102 --> 01:01:39,476
Yes...

519
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,350
but where are you going?

520
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:44,386
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,136
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:47,678
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:49,392
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:52,265
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,851
It's best not to.

526
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:57,309
I'm going out.

527
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,676
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:00,675
Yes.

529
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,970
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,763
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,844
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:13,102 --> 01:02:15,140
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:15,185 --> 01:02:17,639
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:15,219
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:03:56,144 --> 01:03:57,767
Son of a bitch!

536
01:03:58,685 --> 01:04:01,091
Bastard!

537
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:10,809
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,224
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:10,269 --> 01:06:12,390
Help!

540
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,053
<i>Help!

541
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:31,803
Come in.

542
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:35,096
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,470
Thank you.

544
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:42,509
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:43,685 --> 01:06:48,094
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:51,345
And the body?

547
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:53,096
Nothing.

548
01:06:53,602 --> 01:06:55,758
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:02,142
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,058
My son is alive.

551
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:09,891
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:09,935 --> 01:07:11,558
but my son?

553
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,549
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:18,227 --> 01:07:21,593
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:23,641
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:27,768
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:27,852 --> 01:07:30,423
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:35,802
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:39,094
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:39,144 --> 01:07:40,885
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:42,263
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:45,883
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:05,141
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:23,466
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,593
Norma...

566
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:31,507
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,804
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:32,894 --> 01:08:35,845
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:38,144 --> 01:08:39,720
Where are you going?

570
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:48,350
Where are you going?

571
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,384
Norma, love.

572
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:03,972
Everything OK?

573
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,424
Yes.

574
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,802
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:15,217
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:19,393
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:20,970
We tried...

578
01:09:21,519 --> 01:09:24,635
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,385
She rips it off.

580
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:32,261
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:33,394 --> 01:09:36,676
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:36,852 --> 01:09:38,926
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:39,019 --> 01:09:42,052
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:43,559
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:43,644 --> 01:09:46,014
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:48,851
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,215
Maybe...

588
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,178
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:56,971
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:09:57,019 --> 01:09:59,638
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:00,799
How could I know...

592
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:03,803
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:34,681
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:34,769 --> 01:11:37,683
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:38,852 --> 01:11:42,431
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:42,852 --> 01:11:44,642
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:47,844
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:47,977 --> 01:11:51,058
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:54,803
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:06,227 --> 01:12:07,601
Turn around!

601
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,096
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:41,227 --> 01:12:44,509
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:47,640
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:26,386
Eat.

605
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,220
Thank you!

606
01:13:35,227 --> 01:13:37,467
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,764
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:43,644 --> 01:13:46,844
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:53,050
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:53,227 --> 01:13:55,265
We have to talk.

611
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,684
My condolences.

612
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:30,176
We did what we could.

613
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:32,966
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:34,974
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,683
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:39,476
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:43,185 --> 01:14:45,010
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:45,102 --> 01:14:46,264
Yes.

619
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:49,510
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:49,602 --> 01:14:52,683
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:55,257
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:13,394 --> 01:15:15,384
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,632
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,634
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:38,469
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,968
The toys...

627
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,802
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:45,602 --> 01:15:48,173
We buried her today.

629
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:52,676
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:01,769 --> 01:16:04,435
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:07,144 --> 01:16:09,181
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:11,634
That's a good question.

633
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,055
Yes?

634
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:07,476
<i>It's us.

635
01:17:07,602 --> 01:17:09,011
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,720
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:32,008
say there were two 
accidents on the road

638
01:17:32,269 --> 01:17:34,141
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:39,225
Good evening.

640
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:40,638
You're late.

641
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,635
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:45,727
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,133
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:52,518
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:36,806
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:37,602 --> 01:18:39,308
He isn't.

647
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,224
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,350
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:23,807
What's happened?

650
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,391
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,300
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:44,474
No...

653
01:20:31,352 --> 01:20:33,971
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,683
It's very important.

655
01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:41,349
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,301
but the tissues of the vagina are still 
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:46,394 --> 01:20:49,557
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,090
You...

659
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:55,226
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,676
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:04,432
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:04,519 --> 01:21:06,889
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:09,976
In this case...

664
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,760
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:21,642
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:26,217
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,596
but in a few months...

668
01:21:29,727 --> 01:21:32,808
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:34,642
and the skin...

670
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:38,886
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:47,352 --> 01:21:50,967
This is very good.

672
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:55,222
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,969
Four weeks.

674
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:58,851
Can I go now?

675
01:21:59,269 --> 01:22:01,840
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,307
But we've just started.

677
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,182
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:23,227 --> 01:22:25,846
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:28,019 --> 01:22:30,305
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,721
Do you remember 
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:41,894 --> 01:22:44,429
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:50,053
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:51,644 --> 01:22:53,681
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:53,727 --> 01:22:58,052
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:22:59,019 --> 01:23:03,890
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:03,935 --> 01:23:08,474
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,350
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:31,394 --> 01:23:35,174
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:42,467
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,768
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:23:55,602 --> 01:23:58,470
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:01,555
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:02,644 --> 01:24:07,100
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:09,852 --> 01:24:14,593
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:14,685 --> 01:24:18,016
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:22,975
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:24,269 --> 01:24:25,761
like a second skin.

698
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:28,726
Put it on.

699
01:25:14,227 --> 01:25:16,514
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:36,977 --> 01:25:38,304
Bitch!

701
01:26:26,935 --> 01:26:28,309
Stop!

702
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:32,091
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:35,933
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,635
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:53,685 --> 01:26:55,759
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:26:56,935 --> 01:26:58,677
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:35,475
We were lucky.

708
01:27:37,227 --> 01:27:39,017
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:22,935 --> 01:28:25,720
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:33,052
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:20,185 --> 01:30:22,591
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:22,685 --> 01:30:25,091
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:25,185 --> 01:30:26,844
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,215
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:30:52,269 --> 01:30:55,136
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:18,927
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:31:19,394 --> 01:31:22,178
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,058
<i>a place to which...

719
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:26,467
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:31:26,519 --> 01:31:29,185
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:32,014
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:35,183
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:39,556
<i>It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:31:39,602 --> 01:31:41,225
<i>freedom.

725
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:43,058
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:45,763
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:31:45,852 --> 01:31:50,177
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:52,634
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:32:53,977 --> 01:32:55,884
My Cigarral!

730
01:32:56,727 --> 01:32:58,634
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:00,185 --> 01:33:02,888
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:03,019 --> 01:33:06,716
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:07,269 --> 01:33:09,935
I thought you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:10,769 --> 01:33:12,475
I thought that...

735
01:33:12,644 --> 01:33:15,891
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:16,435 --> 01:33:18,592
My poor child.

737
01:33:18,852 --> 01:33:20,926
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,466
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:24,144 --> 01:33:26,016
As you wish.

740
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:29,424
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:31,269 --> 01:33:33,224
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:33,644 --> 01:33:35,053
I'm parched.

743
01:33:39,102 --> 01:33:41,057
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:42,852 --> 01:33:45,175
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:45,394 --> 01:33:48,925
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:49,269 --> 01:33:51,639
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:51,769 --> 01:33:56,058
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:33:56,185 --> 01:33:57,975
I'll explain.

749
01:33:58,852 --> 01:34:01,341
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:05,346
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:07,352 --> 01:34:11,346
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:32,102 --> 01:34:33,808
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:34,519 --> 01:34:36,972
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:37,019 --> 01:34:38,559
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:38,685 --> 01:34:41,304
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:49,227 --> 01:34:50,720
Who is she?

757
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:54,098
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:34:54,894 --> 01:34:56,635
What's she doing?

759
01:34:57,519 --> 01:34:59,225
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:34:59,352 --> 01:35:01,639
I can see that.

761
01:35:03,394 --> 01:35:05,219
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:07,644 --> 01:35:09,848
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:12,761
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:13,144 --> 01:35:16,095
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:17,769 --> 01:35:20,720
I don't want her 
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:21,352 --> 01:35:25,677
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:28,805
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:28,935 --> 01:35:32,597
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,934
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:48,144 --> 01:35:51,592
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:03,935 --> 01:36:06,638
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:19,602 --> 01:36:21,842
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:26,477 --> 01:36:29,261
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,179
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:36,100
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:36,435 --> 01:36:39,635
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:40,935 --> 01:36:42,476
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,594
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:52,591
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:36:53,977 --> 01:36:55,470
Thank you.

781
01:37:58,019 --> 01:37:59,760
Good morning.

782
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,267
Breakfast.

783
01:38:10,769 --> 01:38:12,558
Thank you.

784
01:38:22,477 --> 01:38:24,349
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:24,519 --> 01:38:26,556
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:30,932
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:41,435 --> 01:38:43,094
Last night...

788
01:38:43,935 --> 01:38:45,807
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:45,935 --> 01:38:48,850
we talked a lot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:50,394 --> 01:38:53,676
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:38:55,644 --> 01:38:58,760
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,179
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:03,352 --> 01:39:05,473
that I was free.

794
01:39:07,602 --> 01:39:10,635
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:11,894 --> 01:39:13,849
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:14,435 --> 01:39:16,889
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:17,519 --> 01:39:19,758
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:29,144 --> 01:39:31,893
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:36,467
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,302
She promised not to.

801
01:39:38,394 --> 01:39:41,641
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:46,014
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,636
That's enough!

804
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:52,925
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:39:53,852 --> 01:39:56,850
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:39:57,310 --> 01:40:00,758
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:00,935 --> 01:40:02,511
Thank you.

808
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:20,177
Come along, child!

809
01:40:26,644 --> 01:40:28,681
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:29,227 --> 01:40:32,509
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:34,269 --> 01:40:37,634
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:37,852 --> 01:40:39,843
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:40,727 --> 01:40:42,350
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:42,435 --> 01:40:45,931
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:47,685 --> 01:40:50,600
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:50,685 --> 01:40:52,308
It's not just that.

817
01:40:52,602 --> 01:40:56,382
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:40:58,102 --> 01:41:01,681
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:01,769 --> 01:41:04,601
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:04,727 --> 01:41:07,559
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:07,602 --> 01:41:11,098
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:17,471
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:18,602 --> 01:41:21,766
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:41:55,019 --> 01:41:57,009
Are you still here?

825
01:41:58,394 --> 01:41:59,638
I'm leaving now...

826
01:41:59,769 --> 01:42:03,430
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:07,727 --> 01:42:09,433
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,717
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:12,477 --> 01:42:16,092
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,424
as you can see.

831
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,101
And?

832
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:22,216
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:22,477 --> 01:42:24,267
without hormones.

834
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:26,384
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:26,894 --> 01:42:30,306
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:33,931
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:41,925
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:42,019 --> 01:42:44,175
Don't go there.

839
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:46,716
Those documents you 
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:47,144 --> 01:42:48,092
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:48,185 --> 01:42:50,934
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:53,679
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:42:53,727 --> 01:42:56,642
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:01,351
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:01,435 --> 01:43:03,675
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:05,091
You told us...

847
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:07,804
you'd tested your new skin 
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:07,894 --> 01:43:09,683
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:09,769 --> 01:43:13,099
I think you'd have no scruples 
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:13,185 --> 01:43:15,057
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:15,394 --> 01:43:19,304
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:21,349
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:21,435 --> 01:43:23,473
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:23,519 --> 01:43:26,138
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:28,477 --> 01:43:31,013
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:37,178
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:38,644 --> 01:43:42,424
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:46,758
And...

859
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:48,807
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:50,185 --> 01:43:51,927
A cream?

861
01:43:54,185 --> 01:43:56,852
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:43:58,102 --> 01:44:01,966
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,933
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:05,352 --> 01:44:07,888
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:29,977 --> 01:44:31,553
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:41,227 --> 01:44:42,969
Thank you.

867
01:44:43,269 --> 01:44:46,053
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:12,977 --> 01:45:14,719
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:16,428
Yes.

870
01:45:18,519 --> 01:45:20,509
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:21,727 --> 01:45:24,014
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,552
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:26,644 --> 01:45:28,800
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:28,852 --> 01:45:31,388
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:46,394 --> 01:45:48,550
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:48,685 --> 01:45:49,847
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:49,935 --> 01:45:52,506
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:52,685 --> 01:45:55,802
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:29,435 --> 01:46:32,682
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:44,852 --> 01:46:47,933
At last! 
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:50,435 --> 01:46:51,928
Not yet.

882
01:46:57,852 --> 01:46:59,226
Come on...

883
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,683
What are you doing?

884
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,135
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:07,602 --> 01:47:09,260
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:10,144 --> 01:47:11,885
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:13,394 --> 01:47:15,349
But you promised!

888
01:47:15,477 --> 01:47:17,349
I lied.

889
01:47:56,727 --> 01:47:58,184
Robert?

890
01:48:00,144 --> 01:48:01,601
Robert?

891
01:48:01,727 --> 01:48:03,268
He's asleep.

892
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,302
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,101
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:08,477 --> 01:48:11,261
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:17,935 --> 01:48:19,511
Robert!

896
01:48:20,435 --> 01:48:22,094
My son!

897
01:48:33,144 --> 01:48:36,426
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:40,177
Where are you?

899
01:48:55,352 --> 01:48:57,390
I knew it.

900
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,183
Hello.

901
01:51:07,977 --> 01:51:09,968
You see to her.

902
01:51:12,185 --> 01:51:13,761
Good morning.

903
01:51:26,602 --> 01:51:28,427
What did you want?

904
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:32,348
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:33,435 --> 01:51:35,509
Are you all right?

906
01:51:39,352 --> 01:51:42,101
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:44,185 --> 01:51:46,141
Do you know me?

908
01:51:46,977 --> 01:51:50,805
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:51,852 --> 01:51:55,348
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:51:57,769 --> 01:52:00,850
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:02,894 --> 01:52:05,050
You have to help me.

912
01:52:09,977 --> 01:52:11,683
Look.

913
01:52:12,394 --> 01:52:14,431
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:16,727 --> 01:52:20,803
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:21,144 --> 01:52:23,265
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:23,685 --> 01:52:26,221
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:30,683
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:32,727 --> 01:52:37,550
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:46,884
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,514
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:04,769 --> 01:53:07,471
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:18,644 --> 01:53:21,014
I'm Vicente.
