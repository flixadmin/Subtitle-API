00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,600
That's my mom.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,080
There's no loophole
where I can save my family

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,320
and not screw up history.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm so sorry, Z.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,360
What the hell is going on here?

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,040
This is my dad, Hank.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello, John.

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint,

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
they act as a divining rod,
able to detect the presence

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,280
of beings not belonging
to our world.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,560
Where'd the unicorn go?

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,440
I sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,600
You need to be a part of a team.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,200
No, I would rather bloody top myself
than move in with you lot.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,440
People around me get killed
or far worse.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,160
Oh, bollocks.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
How's our magical upgrade going, Ray?

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
Almost done, I think.

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
Though the they never covered
how to interface time seismographs

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,240
and enchanted bones
in the Ivy U PhD program.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,360
Well, that should do it.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,760
My peers would say that science
and magic don't mix,

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,560
but to them, I'd ask,
"Have you seen, The Fifth Element?"

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Right?

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,560
Ivy U sounds
like a real party school.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh, I hope this works.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,120
We need a way to pinpoint
magical threats on the timeline.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,880
I mean, who knows what kind
of creatures are out there

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
wreaking havoc on history?

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,280
Like, vampires.

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,400
Gremlins.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Aswangs.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,160
Cannibalistic Filipino were-beasts
with proboscis-like tongues.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,120
I've been doing some research
just in case.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
I thought that's
why we had Constantine.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah, about that.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
Constantine is...

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,000
Tired, hungover,
and in need of a stiff one.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,080
Dealer's choice as to what
that's a euphemism for.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,720
He's here.

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,160
Yeah, you know, I meant
what I said about joining you lot.

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,240
But then, I pictured that same lot
squaring off against

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,480
some of the manky buggers
that I've come up against,

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,080
and I thought, "Yeah, you know what?

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,680
You're right. You're all bloody
doomed without me."

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,920
One aswang will take you down
without breaking a sweat.

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
New legend alert.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
I better go update the chore wheel.

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560
Hang on, sunshine.

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm not a bloody legend.

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,480
I'm merely offering my services
as a consultant,

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,720
and as such,
I have some stipulations.

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't do silly costumes,
I expect full benefits,

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
and I require no less
than two weeks paid vacation.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,960
- Vacation?
- Paid?

57
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,120
Easy.

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,880
Hey, it worked.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,040
Will you look at that?
We already got a...

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,080
Do we have a special name
for these magical fugitives?

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,760
Well, I was thinking,
since they're mysteries

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,680
involving mythical beings,

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,920
we could go with myth-teries.

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
Fugitives it is.

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
What's it say?

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
First day on the job,
and you're taking me

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,760
to the bloody witch trials.

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Well, I hope you're feeling
morally superior

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,760
because we are getting
our Puritan purit-on.

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,000
That was too much, right?

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,320
{\an5}I'm telling you, your machine
is clearly buggered.

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
There's nothing magical
about Puritan New England.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
I know. I was there,
but it could all be different now.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Oh, come on.

76
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
{\an5}If a creature landed there,
why would it idle

77
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,800
{\an5}in the absolute worst
possible place for magic?

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,680
{\an5}The people of Salem
are paranoid and petty.

79
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
{\an5}And, besides,
every magical creature knows

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,200
{\an5}that if you want to get weird,
you go to New York.

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
{\an5}Then we need to find it
before it flees.

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
{\an5}All right, well, I agreed
to help you save history,

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,640
not take part in your little
role-playing adventures.

84
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,040
{\an5}Call me if you find anything.

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
{\an5}If he's staying, I'm staying.

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,120
Besides, no fun in Puritan times.

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
{\an5}The Church banned
burning people at the stake.

88
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,480
Well, they didn't
actually burn people.

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,800
That was the Middle Ages.

90
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,160
{\an5}The Puritans used the gallows.
But, yeah, sure, stay.

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,760
{\an5}You know, I actually miss
having someone

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
{\an5}Nate-splain history to us.

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
{\an5}Me too.

94
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
{\an5}Speaking of which,

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
I wonder how Operation
Dinner with Dad is going.

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
{\an5}Thanks.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Good steak.

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,600
{\an5}So, what are you doing
for work these days?

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Little bit of this.
Little bit of that.

100
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,000
You?

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Same old, same old.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,880
Sir, your credit card
was declined.

103
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I...

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,320
I must have given you the,
wrong one.

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
There you go.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,120
And this one expired in 1953.

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,760
{\an5}Then I don't know
why I still carry it.

108
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,560
Do you accept
Athenian tetradrachm?

109
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Notgeld?

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Nathaniel, I've got this.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,480
{\an5}Guess the deductive historical
reconstruction business

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
{\an5}little slow this time of year.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,160
{\an5}Yeah, and I see it's still paying off
to be a Beltway Bandit.

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Really, Nathaniel,
that's how you want to end this?

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
After we connect over a nice dinner.

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,080
{\an5}Have we?
All you've talked about is the steak.

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,880
{\an5}What the hell else
am I supposed to talk about

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
{\an5}if you'd rather just sit there
and silently judge me?

119
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,520
{\an5}Oh, like you're not doing
the same thing.

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
Of course I was, Nathaniel.

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,360
I put you through grad school
to what?

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,160
To collect rare currency?

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
{\an5}Maybe I should follow
your example, right?

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
{\an5}Make a fortune
wasting taxpayers' cash

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
{\an5}on some secret government projects
that you can't even explain?

126
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
It puts food on your plate.

127
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
How's that for an explanation?

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
I don't need your money.

129
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Matter of fact...

130
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
{\an5}I don't need any of this.

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
{\an5}Of course. Running away again, huh?

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
I'll see you in another two years.

133
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
I forgot my leftovers.

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
{\an5}Nathaniel.

135
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>Ah, poor bird</i>

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,320
<i>Take thy flight</i>

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,240
{\an5}<i>High above the sorrows
Of this sad night</i>

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
{\an5}Good morrow. Good morrow.

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
Not the friendliest bunch.

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,920
Look, tone it down, Ray.
This isn't a fun time period.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,120
{\an5}These hats say otherwise.

142
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,760
{\an5}Just try not to stand out.

143
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
{\an5}Salem wasn't exactly
welcoming of outsiders.

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,160
{\an5}Oh, just like
every other time in history.

145
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
They're just worse at hiding it.

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,280
{\an5}Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
{\an5}- Witch!
- Witch! Witch! Witch!

148
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040
Witch!

149
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,200
Wife of Satan, confess your sins.

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,840
Tell now what saw thee
for grounds of accusation?

151
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
I saw her, Reverend Parsons,
dancing in the woods

152
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,360
bare as the day she was born.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,960
Jane Hawthorne, what say you
to this accusation?

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,120
{\an5}I have done no harm. I swear it.

155
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,440
But this man says he bore
witness to your witchcraft.

156
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,240
She has lain with the Devil.

157
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,400
{\an5}I would never,

158
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,880
{\an5}not with the Devil nor with any
man since my husband's passing,

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,480
much to your frustration, good sir.

160
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,960
Goody Hawthorne,
you are hereby under arrest

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,280
and accused of witchcraft.

162
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Your trial will commence
on the morrow.

163
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,320
And if thou be convicted,

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,920
we will purge your kind
from our community.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,760
You cannot do this!
My daughter needs me!

166
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Prudence!

167
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Mother.

168
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Have mercy, please.

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,800
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

170
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

171
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,480
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

172
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,680
{\an5}Well, there are definitely
monsters in Salem,

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,560
just not the magical kind.

174
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,920
Witch! Witch! Witch!

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
Crows, that's ominous.

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,800
Despite the gothic association,

177
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,800
the American crow
is actually a very...

178
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Never mind.

179
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,000
The witch, she commands them!

180
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Remove her from here at once! Go! Go!

181
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,440
Couldn't have been her, could it?

182
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Whatever it is,
looks like we were right.

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,480
There is magic in Salem.

184
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
All right, let's give this thing
a whirl, shall we?

185
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,480
Gideon, do us a favor
and mix us up some ingredients

186
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,240
so I can restock
the old apothecary, will you?

187
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,560
Out of my way. I need some mustard.

188
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be just a minute, mate.

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,560
Now, be a doll, Gideon,
and mix together

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,280
a pinch of possum's tail
with three ounces of frogs' testes.

191
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,520
Open the door!

192
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,720
I need to take a leak!

193
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,000
What's that smell?

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,440
Spellbook, bound in human skin.

195
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,000
It gets a bit rank
if you don't soak it in water.

196
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,200
Get out of my chair, you weasel.

197
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm watching the football.

198
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,760
The game's on already, mate.

199
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
You want a Marmite crumpet?

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,280
What'd you call me?

201
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,960
You know, you need to simmer down
a little bit, sweetheart.

202
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,560
You see, I don't like
to share my space

203
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,360
any more than you, but, here we are.

204
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,760
And why are you here?

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,200
Hey, sorry to break up
the bonding session,

206
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
but we found our fugitive,
and we think it's a real witch.

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
Well, a real witch
must be off her trolley

208
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
to hang around here.

209
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, we just saw a woman
command a murder of crows,

210
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
and now I know why they call it that.

211
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Well, Jane was bound, gagged,
and taken away.

212
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Those birds were just protecting her
from that mob.

213
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,520
I say more power to them.

214
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,280
And I agree with you, in theory,

215
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,800
but we still have
to remove that power.

216
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,360
Gideon, what do you have
on Jane Hawthorne?

217
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,600
<i>On October 29, 1692,
Jane Hawthorne's execution</i>

218
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
<i>was at the center
of what came to be known</i>

219
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
<i>as The Burning of Salem.</i>

220
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
"On the day she hung,

221
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,720
all of the people of Salem
spontaneously combusted.

222
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
The whole town was set ablaze."

223
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,560
Sounds like my kind of woman.

224
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Well, the incident was enough
to convince the public

225
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
that witches were real.

226
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,160
Whatever it is,
Jane's at the center of it.

227
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Well, hang on a minute.

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,720
- You said that she was gagged.
- Yeah.

229
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Did any of you actually
hear her cast a spell?

230
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
You see, spells are a verbal game,
mateys.

231
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Was there anyone else there,

232
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,520
someone who would want
to protect Jane?

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
- Prudence.
- Her daughter.

234
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
A malevolent demon
has attached itself to the child,

235
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,560
and the mother is being blamed.

236
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
I've seen it a million times over.

237
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

238
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,720
Let's get to it, shall we?

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,040
Well, look who started to care.

240
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,320
But I am not wearing a costume.

241
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
I'll see you later, big man.

242
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Gary?

243
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Is that you?

244
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
Did you sleepwalk to work again?

245
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh, my God!

246
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,280
What is wrong with you?

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,520
Nate?
What the hell are you doing here?

248
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,360
And why aren't you wearing pants?

249
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I can explain.

250
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,920
And thank you for not
mentioning the shower cap.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Pretend I did.

252
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,040
Coconut oil makes
my hair more buoyant.

253
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,200
Really? I should try that.

254
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,560
And, the pants situation?

255
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,120
Well, I decided to extend my trip
to 2018,

256
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
and I may possibly be living
a little bit at the Bureau.

257
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
You couldn't spring for a hotel?

258
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, here's a fun fact
about staying in the present,

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,520
it costs money, and as a legend,

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,240
your salary is the friendships
you make along the way.

261
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,920
- Got ya.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,080
And you?
I know you love paperwork, but...

263
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh, yes, I'm presenting my budget

264
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
to the Department of Defense
tomorrow.

265
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
Rip was always good
at schmoozing the bigwigs.

266
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
It was never really my thing.

267
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
And now, with this whole
magic initiative,

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
we're gonna need even more money.

269
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,000
I can help. I'm great at schmoozing.

270
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
Oh, no, no, thank you.

271
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
What? Why not?

272
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
I need a place to stay.
You need a wingman.

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
It'll be fun, and we can hang out.

274
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,920
We'll get into adventures.

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,680
Okay, okay, you know what?
Let's do it.

276
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,600
Just put some pants on.

277
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Hey...

278
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
You just got schmoozed.

279
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,520
There she is.
She doesn't have anyone.

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,520
<i>Soul, soul, soul cake</i>

281
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,560
<i>Please, good missus, a soul cake</i>

282
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,800
<i>Soul, soul...</i>

283
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,600
All right, let's move.

284
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,640
<i>Please, good missus, a soul cake</i>

285
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,680
<i>An apple, a plum, a peach,
Or a cherry</i>

286
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,600
<i>Any good thing to make us all merry</i>

287
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
<i>One for Peter, one for Paul</i>

288
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,880
<i>Three for him who made us all</i>

289
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Why dost thou follow me?

290
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
Hi, Prudence.
We're just here to help.

291
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,920
You're strangers.
I have no need of your aid.

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Now be gone with haste.

293
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
John.

294
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,480
What magic is this?

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
Look, it's gonna be okay.

296
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
Agent of the damned,

297
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,360
show yourself, you fetid creature.

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,080
Show yourself, you cursed beast.

299
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
Reveal your hideous form!

300
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Hello.

301
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
What in the Disney hell is this?

302
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
You got to be kidding me.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,480
That's your monster?

304
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,800
Monster?

305
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,480
Why, I am nothing of the sort.

306
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,960
I am a fairy godmother,

307
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,840
and I mean only
to make dreams come true.

308
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Because a dream
is a wish your heart...

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
Don't say another word.

310
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120
Constantine, please tell me
you have something for this.

311
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,360
This is, new.

312
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,080
Prudence,
this is your fairy godmother?

313
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,040
It is. She protects me.

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
By hurting other people.

315
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
Not at all.

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,120
I only want to help little Prudence,
for, you see...

317
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,160
There are times the world is scary,

318
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,040
times the world is bad...

319
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
But when your godmother's a fairy...

320
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,560
<i>There's no reason to be sad</i>

321
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Is that music?

322
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,440
<i>So fear not if things
Don't look to be</i>

323
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,680
<i>The way that you preferred</i>

324
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,400
<i>Just make a wish and look to me</i>

325
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,680
<i>I'll sing these magic words</i>

326
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Shut up!

327
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
I didn't want her to stop singing.

328
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,840
Oh, to hell with this.

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Oh, my, you don't want to do that.

330
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,360
And why wouldn't we?

331
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,040
Because Prudence and I
share a bond.

332
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,600
If you send me to hell,
she goes right down with me.

333
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,360
These people want to send us to hell.

334
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,240
You don't want to go to hell,
do you, deary?

335
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
No.

336
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
Would you like me
to make them go away?

337
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,480
As you wish.

338
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,760
<i>We'll start with some tree roots</i>

339
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>Up from the ground</i>

340
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,960
Prudence, you don't need her.

341
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
<i>And then summon some birds</i>

342
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,280
<i>What a beautiful sound</i>

343
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
Okay, you can stop singing now.

344
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,640
<i>And just as they gather
Over your head</i>

345
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,960
Prudence, you don't have to do this.

346
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,200
<i>I'll tell them, "Attack!"</i>

347
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>And you'll all end up</i>

348
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
We're here to save your mother.

349
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Godmother, wait.

350
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
Release them.

351
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,080
As you wish.

352
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,880
But I'm at your call
when you need me.

353
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,680
You got to admit, though,
that was a catchy tune.

354
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,960
Where am I?

355
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Someplace safe
just until we can get you home.

356
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I've seen many wonders
these past days.

357
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,080
And I believe you, like Godmother,

358
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,640
were sent by the Lord,
the answer to our prayers.

359
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,920
Here, it's a doughnut.

360
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,400
<i>I la-la-love you.</i>

361
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,600
Many wonders indeed.

362
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
All right, guys.

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,720
Remember the three
C's of pitching,

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
confidence, charisma...

365
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Oh, crap. That's my dad.

366
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
- Wait a second. That's your dad?
- Yeah.

367
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
This must be one of his secret
government projects

368
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,600
he could never tell me about.

369
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,840
I can't go in there, Ava.

370
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,240
I will make this worse.

371
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,360
Come on, Nate, you're family.
How bad could it be?

372
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,240
Oh, last time I saw him,
I insulted his life's work

373
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,520
and literally said,
"I don't need your money."

374
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,680
- Oh, okay, that's bad.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,680
Look, I cannot do this alone.

376
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,160
- You don't have to.
- Thank you.

377
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
Gary, you know my part
of the pitch, right?

378
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,600
Okay, okay,
maybe I can do this alone.

379
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,720
No, look at this guy.

380
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
He's got confidence.
He's got charisma.

381
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
- He's got...
- Crap.

382
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,000
I got my arm stuck
in the poster tube.

383
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,680
Ava, I know my dad, okay?

384
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,480
You're not gonna want to go
in there without backup.

385
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,920
Fine, Gary, you're in.

386
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,360
All right, Director Sharpe.

387
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,520
Let's give 'em the old ham and eggs.

388
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Damn it.

389
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,760
The godmother was telling the truth.

390
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
We can't send her to hell

391
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,680
without sending Prudence
down with her.

392
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,120
Bloody fairy godmothers.

393
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,120
They're like parasites
who feed off their hosts.

394
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
Their magic, it only works
at the whim of their charge.

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
The girl will have to reject
the godmother.

396
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
Who's going to give up
that kind of power,

397
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,560
especially in her situation?

398
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,560
We just have to give her
what she wants.

399
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
If we save her mom,
she won't need the godmother.

400
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
Z, we can't.

401
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,000
I checked the historical record.

402
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,800
Jane Hawthorne
was executed as a witch.

403
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
That was canon
before the fairy godmother

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,040
affected the timeline.

405
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
We can't change that.

406
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,160
So we're just gonna let them do it?

407
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,920
Sara, this is exactly
what it's like where I'm from

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
the tribalism, scapegoating,

409
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
persecuting someone
just because they're different,

410
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,800
while other people
just stand by and do nothing.

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,440
I don't want it to go down
like this either, Z.

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm sorry,
but we don't have a choice.

413
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Look, I promised her
that I would help her.

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
Well, you made a promise
that we can't keep.

415
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
The priority here is separating
Prudence from her godmother.

416
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,200
That's how we're gonna
save more lives.

417
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
So, in the meantime,

418
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,000
we just let her think
we're saving her mom?

419
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Great.

420
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm here to save you, Jane.

421
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
- Who art thee?
- We need to go now.

422
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

423
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,080
Look, I get that you're scared,
but I can protect you.

424
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,640
You need to trust me.

425
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Come, please.

426
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,800
I believe you mean well...

427
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
but I cannot go.

428
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,920
These people are insane.

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,600
They're gonna kill you
no matter what.

430
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,120
They are afraid,

431
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
and fear brings out the worst
in all of us.

432
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,120
Therefore, I must forgive them...

433
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,080
for they know not what they do.

434
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,920
Well, at least one of you Puritans
gets the point of that book.

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
If I disappear now,

436
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,480
others will pay for my cowardice,

437
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,360
and I will not allow innocents
to suffer.

438
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,800
What about your daughter's
suffering, her powers?

439
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,080
Think about how your actions
are going to affect her.

440
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
She is the only one of whom I think.

441
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,880
I made her swear to me

442
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,840
that she would never
use her power henceforth.

443
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,520
As long as she heeds my command,
my Prudence will live.

444
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,160
But what kind of life
is it gonna be...

445
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,440
where you died
and she couldn't protect you?

446
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,440
That guilt is gonna follow her
her whole life.

447
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,760
She'll end up mad at herself
and mad at the world.

448
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,080
Please, we have to go.

449
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
My daughter is strong.

450
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,400
In time, with God's love,

451
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,800
she will let go of these burdens.

452
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,000
Jane, don't do this, please.

453
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,000
Thou must go with haste.

454
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,120
It came from the jail.

455
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,840
You shall not flee
your punishment, witch.

456
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,080
Your trial awaits.

457
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
It's useless, piece of...

458
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,160
I know you're there, you old bat.

459
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
Why don't you show yourself, eh?

460
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,440
We'll have ourselves a little chat.

461
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,320
A simple please and thank-you
would do, my pet.

462
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,600
Although it has been quite amusing
watching you prattle on.

463
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, Granny.

464
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,600
You've had your fun,

465
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,520
and now it's time to let go
of dear Prudence

466
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
and be on your merry way.

467
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,480
All I want is to make
the world a happier place.

468
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,120
You got her mother thrown
in the bloody clink.

469
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
And what about that bloke
who had his eyes

470
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
pecked out of his skull, eh?

471
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
That man was a liar.

472
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,000
They are all liars,

473
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,680
and simple-minded pests like
that must be taught a lesson.

474
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,080
Oh, "pests."

475
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Intriguing choice of words.

476
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,840
Before Prudence,
all the girls I helped

477
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,200
were just take, take, take.

478
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
"I want a new dress, Godmother."

479
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,640
"I want to go to the ball,
Godmother."

480
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,280
So I gave, and I gave,
no matter how absurd the request.

481
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,800
I mean, who would ever choose
to wear glass slippers?

482
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
Imagine the blisters!

483
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
And what did I get in return?

484
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,680
A thousand years locked away
in a dank and miserable dimension.

485
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,120
So it was humans
who put you away, eh?

486
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,920
Well, it serves you right,
you bitter old nag.

487
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
You don't want Prudence happy.

488
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,440
You want her raging.

489
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
That's how you settle the score,

490
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,480
by using a child's anger
to rain down hellfire

491
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
on those poor bastards out there.

492
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Hellfire, you say?

493
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
Not a bad idea.

494
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
Ta-ta, my pet.

495
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,880
My Prudence will be needing me soon.

496
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
And what situations

497
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,560
require our continued funding,
Director Sharpe?

498
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Sir, do you remember
when dinosaurs took over

499
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,000
downtown Los Angeles?

500
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,560
Or when a telepathic gorilla
tried to kill Barack Obama?

501
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
You know that I don't.

502
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,240
And that's because we did our job.

503
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,720
The timeline was
in complete shambles,

504
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,680
but I'm proud to say
that we finally put things

505
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,040
back into its proper place.

506
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
So your job is done.

507
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,440
What are all these people
still doing here?

508
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,240
See, the timeline is very fragile.

509
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
There's always a threat
of one kind or another.

510
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,280
Now there's magic.

511
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,040
- Magic?
- Yes.

512
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,160
You see, last year,
there was a time demon

513
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,280
named "Mollus."

514
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,040
Mallus, but it, it...
We're not gonna...

515
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,640
And in order to kill him,

516
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,160
the legends broke his prison,
which, surprise, surprise,

517
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,920
released an unknown number
of other dangerous magical beings,

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
all of whom got spat out
across the timeline

519
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,840
and now must be hunted down
and sent to hell.

520
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,280
- Did I miss anything?
- No, actually.

521
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,080
You know, I've had to oversee

522
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,760
some really far-out projects
in my career,

523
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,480
but I can't in good conscience
have the D.O.D.

524
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,400
pay for a department
that fights fairy tales.

525
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Sir, with all due respect,
you cannot shut us down, please.

526
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,840
The damage that these
supernatural fugitives

527
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,040
can cause is unfathomable.

528
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,840
Director Sharpe, you seem
like a very capable leader.

529
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,080
Now, you say
there's magic out there.

530
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,200
And I say that I need proof.

531
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
- Well...
- Here's proof.

532
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,120
A unicorn ate my nipple.

533
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Right.

534
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm shutting this place down.

535
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Gary, put it away!

536
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,280
Have you guys seen Z?

537
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,560
With the witch?

538
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Prudence isn't a witch.
Not that witches are bad.

539
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,880
Prudence is alone.
I just checked. Gideon.

540
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
<i>Miss Tomaz gave me
explicit instructions</i>

541
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,640
<i>not to tell you
that she was leaving the ship.</i>

542
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,800
That can't be good.

543
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,760
Stay with the kid.
Don't piss her off.

544
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,400
Where the hell are you, Z?

545
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,240
And, lo, she called upon
her master to set her free.

546
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,480
And t'were it not
for these brave men,

547
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,000
she might have succeeded.

548
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
And now...

549
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,400
before your very eyes...

550
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
The mark of the Devil upon her flesh.

551
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,520
It's a birthmark, jerk.

552
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,680
Watch now as I attempt to draw blood
from Satan's brand.

553
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,200
It will not bleed.

554
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Back.

555
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,680
The word of God shall be my shield.

556
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
The Lord has mercy.

557
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,520
The witch, stop her
before she destroys us all.

558
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,480
Stop it. She didn't do anything.

559
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
Why can't you idiots
see what he's doing?

560
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,360
He's convincing you
to kill your neighbors

561
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,040
for imaginary crimes.

562
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,200
If you're looking for the real
source of evil in this town,

563
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
it's him.

564
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Witch.

565
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,880
Witch, another witch.

566
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,680
Remove that cursed bauble from her.

567
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,680
What the hell am I doing?

568
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,280
Take her now.

569
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
No.

571
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,720
The Devil's hold over these witches
is stronger than we have ever faced.

572
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,480
Hanging them will not suffice.

573
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,560
They must burn.

574
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,000
Burn, burn, burn...

575
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,240
<i>You feel that, don't you, deary?</i>

576
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,080
<i>Something is amiss.</i>

577
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,520
I worry for my mother.

578
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,120
I thought she'd be rescued by now.

579
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,720
It does seem odd.

580
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,720
You were promised
by those strange visitors

581
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
that she would be saved,
were you not?

582
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,600
Curious, then,
that they have not delivered.

583
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Shall we see what the delay is?

584
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,840
Can you do that?

585
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,800
I can do anything, sweetkins.

586
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,640
All you must do is ask.

587
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,720
<i>According to the historical record,</i>

588
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,960
<i>Jane Hawthorne
was executed as a witch.</i>

589
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,960
<i>That was canon
before the fairy godmother</i>

590
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,520
<i>affected the timeline.</i>

591
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,160
<i>We can't change that.</i>

592
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,000
Looks like your new friends
lied to you.

593
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,800
They have no intention
of saving your poor, helpless mummy.

594
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,200
Now, what would you have me
do about that, my pet?

595
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,280
- Prudence, hold on.
- Out of my way, you swine.

596
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Ta-ta.

597
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Bloody hell.

598
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Shut up.

599
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
Stay back.

600
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,240
Come, deary.

601
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,760
Let's show these nasty villagers
what real magic looks like.

602
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Hey, how'd it go out there?

603
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,200
Well, you better start
packing your things,

604
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,000
because he just gave the entire
Bureau an eviction notice.

605
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,400
Did you tell him
about the magical creatures?

606
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,360
Oh, yeah. He's not buying it.
He needs proof.

607
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,720
- Oh, that is such a Hank thing.
- Well, maybe he'll believe you.

608
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
Why don't you just tell him
the truth?

609
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Nate, it can't go worse than
what just happened back there.

610
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,320
Look, I spent my whole life
trying to convince Hank

611
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,560
that I made something of myself,

612
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,000
and most of the time,
I was faking it, okay?

613
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,200
So he's supposed to suddenly
believe I'm a superhero

614
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,120
who fought a unicorn, come on.

615
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,880
Look, I know it's hard doing good
when it seems like no one notices,

616
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
but I have seen
the good that you can do, okay?

617
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,800
And that's why I believe
that you can help us here,

618
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,640
not because you're Hank's son,
but because you, look at me,

619
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,800
you are a hero, okay?

620
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,160
Now, Gary's seeing him out.
We still have time.

621
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,920
- You schmoozed me.
- Did it work?

622
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,080
You sure I can't interest you
in a coffee, tea, fizzy water?

623
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,560
Just the validation.

624
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,480
I think you're doing a great job.

625
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Validation.

626
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Okay.

627
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
Hello, is anybody here?

628
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
Gideon, I don't have time for this.

629
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,760
I need proof that magic exists,
and I need it...

630
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
Hello, piggy.
What are you doing here?

631
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm afraid that's no ordinary pig,
Mr. Heywood.

632
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,440
Shut the front door.

633
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Ray, that's you?

634
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Slow down.

635
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
You got turned into a pig.

636
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
But you think you'll be better soon

637
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
because the team's
working on it as we speak.

638
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
Mick got turned, too?
Well, where is he?

639
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
Listen, I know
you're in a situation right now,

640
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,040
but I could really use your help
at the Bureau.

641
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,600
Yes, of course I'll carry you.
Come on.

642
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,480
In the name of our Heavenly Father,
let these witches burn.

643
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,560
Cleanse this town
and its people of this evil

644
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,040
and send these wretched souls
to their master in hell.

645
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,720
You don't have to listen to him.

646
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,600
You know this is wrong.

647
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,680
This woman is your neighbor,
your friend.

648
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,200
She doesn't deserve this.

649
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
No one does.

650
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,800
This witch is more dangerous
than any we have faced.

651
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
She wore this cursed stone.

652
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,200
Let the women go.

653
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Light the pyre.

654
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,360
Let God's work be done.

655
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
Do it, and he's dead.

656
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,840
My soul will live with God
for all of time.

657
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Screw it.

658
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
No!

659
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Stop!

660
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,080
Free them from the pyre.

661
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,920
Mother.

662
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,080
What's wrong with her?
What did they do?

663
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
She's gonna be okay.

664
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,080
Now, my pet, what shall we do

665
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,200
about that horrid man
who hurt your mummy?

666
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,440
I want him to burn.

667
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Hank.

668
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
- Are you sure this is going to work?
- No.

669
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,280
Nathaniel?
What are you doing here?

670
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
I work here.

671
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,120
That's right, Dad.
I'm a time traveler.

672
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,480
How, how do you even know
about the Time Bureau?

673
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,200
What are you doing with a pig?

674
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,920
You want proof magic exists?

675
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Well, here it is.

676
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Just give me a minute.

677
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
Now, Ray. Ray, do it.

678
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
What? No, just come to life.

679
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Prudence, listen to me.

680
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,200
This isn't who you are.

681
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,640
You're a good person.

682
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,480
He tried to kill my mother.

683
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,320
This town, these people,

684
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,360
they've killed
so many others already.

685
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,800
They deserve to burn.

686
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,560
And they will pay
for their ignorance,

687
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,720
but not like that.

688
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,480
How else will they learn, deary?

689
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,360
If these people
aren't taught a lesson today,

690
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,240
they will go and hurt others
for days and years to come.

691
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,000
You come from the future.

692
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,280
Can you honestly tell this child

693
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,520
that the hearts of men change
in all that time?

694
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Do they?

695
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,360
No, they don't.

696
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,600
People always fear
what they don't understand,

697
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,880
and that fear turns them
into monsters.

698
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,840
But we can't let it turn us
into monsters, too.

699
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,880
We have to be better than them.

700
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Be better? What nonsense.

701
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,280
Be stronger, my pet.

702
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,600
Show them the power that you possess.

703
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,080
Make them grovel at your feet
where they belong.

704
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,080
Think of your mother.

705
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,400
Yes, think of your mother.

706
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,280
What would she want you to do,

707
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
get blood on your hands

708
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
or forgive them

709
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
for they know not what they do?

710
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,040
Godmother...

711
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,680
Fire and brimstone coming right...

712
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I release you.

713
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
That's more like it.

714
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,720
Son, I don't know
who put you up to this, but...

715
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Oh, yeah, I'm also a superhero.

716
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
And this is my friend Ray.

717
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,120
Oh, hi, Mr. Heywood.

718
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Nice to finally meet you.

719
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
How much money do you need

720
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,360
to ensure that this
never happens again?

721
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,640
Four point two billion a year, sir.

722
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Done.

723
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Help!

724
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,000
You vile, meddling bitch!

725
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,280
And that is for taking my mouth,
you silly old bat.

726
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,960
I was so terrified
of losing you, Mother.

727
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,680
And I, you, my sweet girl.

728
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
So what now?

729
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Am I free?

730
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah, you're free,

731
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
but you're gonna need
a change of scenery.

732
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Thank you.

733
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,440
Where on Earth are you taking me?

734
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,600
Oh, not on Earth, love.

735
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,080
Where I'm sending you
is a touch hotter,

736
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,640
or so I hear.

737
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,440
You intend to send me to hell.

738
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,160
I could be persuaded otherwise.

739
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
I'm listening.

740
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
You need a host
to conduct your magic,

741
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,120
and let's just say
I'm in need of a miracle.

742
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
You want to be my new host?

743
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,080
Tit for tat, deary.

744
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,880
John Constantine...

745
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
Yes, my pet,
I know exactly who you are.

746
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,760
I know you're on the run,

747
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,080
and I know who's coming for you,

748
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,440
and, believe me, I'd rather face
hell than piss him off.

749
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,160
Well, I am happy to oblige.

750
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
This is your last chance, Granny.

751
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,720
There's no helping you, deary.

752
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,880
You're more damned than I.

753
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,960
Bippity, boppity...

754
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,920
<i>Miss Tomaz has entered the bridge.</i>

755
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,920
I see that, Gideon.

756
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,040
Exit narc mode.

757
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Narc mode.

758
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,480
You're not the only one on the ship

759
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,240
who knows how to get Gideon
to do things.

760
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,200
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to say anything.

761
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,160
I already hate myself.

762
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,240
No, it's not like that.

763
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,200
I, I understand
why you did what you did.

764
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,480
I've felt that rage before, a lot.

765
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Well, I haven't.

766
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,680
Turns out sarcasm
is a really great way

767
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,800
to hide some seriously
deep-seated anger.

768
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,080
I get it, and that's all
I wanted to say,

769
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
is that if you want
to talk to me, I'm here.

770
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Look...

771
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,520
In 2018...

772
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
I found my mom.

773
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
I didn't talk to her, but...

774
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,440
she was right there, and...

775
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,280
I couldn't think
of a way to save her.

776
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Yeah, it's hard.

777
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,160
I've lost a lot of people, too,

778
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,040
and I still think about saving them.

779
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,520
And I don't think that anger
ever goes away.

780
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,360
It's okay.

781
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,760
You just can't hold it in
all the time.

782
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,920
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do with it.

783
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,440
Well, let's figure it out together.

784
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,680
And then we formed Voltron-Beebo

785
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,560
and opened a serious can
of whup-ass on Mallus,

786
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,400
thus saving the universe
for the second time.

787
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,400
So this is what you've been
doing with your life

788
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,040
for the past two years.

789
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,160
Wow, Nathaniel, you did it.

790
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,320
You finally found
a useful application

791
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,640
for that history degree.

792
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,880
Still not letting it go.

793
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Take the win, son.

794
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
You've done good here.

795
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,840
I look forward to working with you.

796
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,080
- Dinner Friday?
- Yeah.

797
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,200
Here you go.

798
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,600
Parking is right this way.

799
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Do you hear that?

800
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,640
That's 4.2 billion, hell to the yes.

801
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,280
Meet me uptown, Ava Sharpe.

802
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,200
- Okay, that was terrifying.
- Yeah.

803
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
But clearly effective.

804
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Thank you.

805
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,240
Anytime. Always happy to help.

806
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
How about tomorrow?

807
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,920
Now that I have 4.2 billion dollars

808
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,320
burning a hole in my pocket,
you said you could use some income.

809
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,440
I could use a guy like you
around here.

810
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Think about it.

811
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,880
Clothes, check.

812
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,840
Non-cloven digits, check.

813
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Portal home...

814
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Check.

815
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
After you, my friend.

816
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
You go ahead.

817
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm gonna stick around
a little while longer,

818
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,720
give dinner with Dad another go.

819
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,080
Oh, okay. Yeah, great.

820
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,720
So, we'll, we'll see you
for the next one.

821
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Absolutely.

822
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Okay.
