1
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,030
There's a big gap.

2
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,369
This feels
like the only route, let's keep going.

3
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,168
You okay?

4
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,132
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,218
Okay.

6
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,680
- One, two, three!
- Be careful.

7
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,225
You okay?

8
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,268
Okay.

9
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,231
- Oh, my god.
- Never better.

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Okay.

11
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,076
- Whoa, whoa, you're good.
- Shit.

12
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,911
You're good. Yeah?

13
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,497
- You're good?
- No.

14
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,500
Okay, you've done way scarier than this.

15
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,877
Remember a.J. Hackett, snake dike?

16
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,256
Stupid singing competition.
God, you married this sad sack,

17
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,882
for Christ's sake.

18
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,926
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,347
Two...

20
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,431
Three!

21
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,725
Come on! I got you.

22
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,435
That's my girl.

23
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,274
Ew! Gross!

24
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,317
You guys, get a room!

25
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,820
Here comes Ethan hunt.

26
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,781
Careful, h, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

27
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,325
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

28
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,785
I'm fine.

29
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,871
Whoo!

30
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,497
Try to keep up!

31
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,467
Taking your time there, hotshot.

32
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,889
Hunter, you show off!

33
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,265
Whoo!

34
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,072
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

35
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,395
Dan, are you okay?

36
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,730
Just hold on. I'm coming down.

37
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,984
Come on. Come on. I can't make it.

38
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,237
- [Gaspingl oh, my god.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,446
I need a little more length.

40
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,949
Can you UN-clip? Are you secure?

41
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,533
- Are you secure?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,701
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

43
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,204
Just UN-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

44
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,997
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

45
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,123
Ready?

46
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,921
Can you reach it?

47
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,422
Just... just one second.

48
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,882
All right. I think I can make it.

49
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,842
Hold on, Dan.

50
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,779
- I'm almost there.
- Just need a little more momentum.

51
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,804
Okay.

52
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,598
No!

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,768
Dan!

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,502
Hey!

55
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,713
This is Becky and Dan.
Leave a message.

56
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,507
Hey, Becky, it's me.

57
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,261
Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.

58
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,512
But I...

59
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,308
I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.

60
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,935
Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.

61
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,980
So whenever you stop hating on me,

62
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,398
I am here.

63
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,056
Hey, what's up?

64
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,185
This is just the voice mail.
You've reached Dan.

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,395
Just leave a message,
I'i/ hit you back when I can.

66
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,023
Get it off at the beep.

67
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,358
Hey.

68
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,361
Miss you.

69
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,789
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

70
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,209
No, I just don't know what else to do,
'cause you're not answering your phone.

71
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,294
- Take a hint.
- I-I think this is getting

72
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,630
- a little bit ridiculous.
- "Ridiculous"?

73
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,717
You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.

74
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,470
No. I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

75
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,697
that you were putting him up on,

76
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,724
that he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.

77
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,518
This is how you console your daughter?

78
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,853
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

79
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,982
I don't want to move on. I miss him!

80
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,360
Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.

81
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,404
- I miss the way he made me feel.
- Sweetie.

82
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,072
- Don't!
- Don't what?

83
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,674
What do you think you're doing, Becky?

84
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,718
- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving. Stop it.

85
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,077
Fuck off!

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,829
You don't get to talk to me like that.

87
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,790
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

88
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:59,920
So getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you,

89
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,213
it's not gonna work.

90
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,050
All right, look,
a horrible thing happened to you,

91
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,344
but you have to start
living your life again.

92
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,639
All right? There's a whole big wide world
out there that needs you

93
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,434
and believe it or not, I need you.

94
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,644
Let me give you a ride home.

95
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,314
I'd rather walk.

96
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,610
Let me ask you something.

97
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,615
If roles reversed, if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

98
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,326
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

99
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,789
Drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is?

100
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,626
He's not.

101
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,253
And you damn well know it.

102
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,174
God damn it, Becky, I need you to try.

103
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,794
Do you know what I need, dad?

104
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,222
I need you to leave me alone.

105
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,690
God damn it.

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,951
The number you have
called has been disconnected.

107
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,167
Mwmm

108
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,916
- Hi!
- Hey.

109
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,709
You look, um...

110
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,087
- Awful.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,298
Yeah, like really freakin' awful.
Well, come here.

112
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,305
So, what brings you back?

113
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,099
Are you finally ready to rest?

114
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,726
I'll rest when I'm dead.

115
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,731
I have something that's planned
and I need a partner in crime.

116
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,611
Look, your dad called me a few weeks ago.

117
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,324
He didn't know who else to turn to,
and he said that you were in a bad place.

118
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,702
- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.

119
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,163
It's coming up on a year.
He doesn't want you to be alone.

120
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,207
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

121
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,168
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there

122
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,337
is my best friend stuck in here with him.

123
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,716
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

124
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,719
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

125
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,309
The 8-6? TV tower.

126
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,311
It's only a six-hour drive from here.

127
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,354
I was planning on climbing it this weekend

128
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,857
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

129
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,697
It would be an adventure,
like old times.

130
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,326
And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.

131
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,580
- I just... I haven't climbed since...
- I get it.

132
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,419
But if you don't confront your fears,
you are always going to be afraid.

133
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,129
What is it that Dan used to say?

134
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,342
"Don't... die if you wanna live

135
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,011
or keep living even if you're dying."

136
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,814
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

137
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,640
No, I'm sorry.

138
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,725
Hunter, I just... I can't.

139
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,520
It's like I know I can't do it, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,272
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

141
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,274
- I can't.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

142
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,693
It's okay.

143
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,233
Morning, Princess.

144
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,029
What's wrong?

145
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,281
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

146
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,119
That's what Dan used to say.

147
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,497
Let's do it.

148
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,958
Let's climb your stupid tower.

149
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,044
Oh, my god, Becky, baby, I'm so excited!

150
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,721
I've never
actually seen this video.

151
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,266
Shit, I was really ripped.

152
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,685
Yeah! You're awesome.

153
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,770
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

154
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,607
Aw!

155
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,819
Holy shit! Look at your beaming face.

156
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,571
Now, who's this in the photo with you?

157
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,197
I don't know. It's an oldie.

158
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,867
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

159
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,785
- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.

160
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,996
It's nothing. Just some guy.

161
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,665
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

162
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,721
Yo, what's up, guys?

163
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,474
Danger d, and I'm back stateside, yo!

164
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,434
Hashtag, super badass.

165
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,020
Okay, in my defense,

166
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,273
I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.

167
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,733
I get paid for this shit.

168
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,068
It's enough to keep me traveling
and you know me,

169
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,738
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping,

170
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,740
so I might as well monetize that.

171
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,534
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a youtuber,

172
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,495
why not be yourself? You are awesome.

173
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,206
- Natural born clickbait.
- No.

174
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,375
What we're doing here, this is clickbait.

175
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,714
Excuse me?

176
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,800
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

177
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,551
Power ain't free, ma'am.

178
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,846
Oh, and do you know
where the b-67 TV tower is?

179
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,015
We can't find it on the map.

180
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,061
You don't need a map.
You see that light way up there?

181
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,523
That's your tower.

182
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,650
That's insanely high.

183
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,333
What's with the light? I thought you said
it was out of commission.

184
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,031
So aircraft can see it.

185
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,953
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the us.

186
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,622
Now it's just this old relic.

187
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,083
They're due
to tear it down next winter.

188
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,293
Becky?

189
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,504
Becky?

190
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,589
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

191
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,259
What are you doing?

192
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,263
A very cool life hack.

193
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,891
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs

194
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,144
with the elements in the lamp. And...

195
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,607
How's that for a dumb youtuber?

196
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,921
Hey, honey.

197
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,923
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

198
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,723
I love you.

199
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,730
You're not gonna say it back?

200
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,858
I am saying it.

201
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,738
Four...

202
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,821
Three...

203
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,783
I love you.

204
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,598
Hey, come on, becks. Sun's up.

205
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,982
What up, El capitan?

206
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,485
I don't know,
but something's up, sports illustrated.

207
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,111
Tits for clicks.

208
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,326
Are you live streaming?

209
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,536
No, dude. Shoot now, post later.

210
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,830
Oh, good. I don't wanna be in it.

211
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,459
Hey, guys. Danger d here

212
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,337
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

213
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,799
- Say hello, Becky c.
- Hi.

214
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:11,346
And we have something
totally batshit crazy for you guys today.

215
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,266
The b-67 TV tower.

216
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,603
This bad boy is over 2,000 feet tall.

217
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,941
And your homegirls are gonna be climbing
to the tippy, tippy top.

218
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,860
But don't worry, Becky c,

219
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,654
- because you're safe with...
- Watch out!

220
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,372
Holy shit!

221
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,498
Whoo!

222
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,542
Eight more lives, baby!

223
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,288
Shit.

224
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,673
Looks like we're walking from here.

225
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,592
- How far?
- I don't know.

226
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,180
Like a mile?

227
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,514
Maybe two-ish?

228
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,104
Damn, it's hot.

229
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,440
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

230
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,127
We've got enough water, you think?

231
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,612
Water's check. Harnesses check.

232
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,281
Super badass 4k drone check.

233
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,408
Selfie stick, all the essentials.

234
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,910
Food?

235
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,512
Nah, we'll be back in time before lunch...

236
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,205
Oh, Jesus.

237
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,293
Holy shit, they're big.

238
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,093
It's still alive. Get off of him!

239
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,512
- Hey! Hey!
- Go away!

240
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,430
Just go. Go!

241
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,563
Poor thing.

242
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,777
Pricks.

243
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,054
Survival of the fittest, right?

244
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,368
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

245
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,622
- "Feeling peckish."
- Hunter.

246
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,874
What? That's funny.

247
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,433
- Holy shit, 300 likes.
- Oh, wow.

248
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,353
350.

249
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,022
I wonder how many
of your followers are serial killers.

250
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,527
Holy shit.

251
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,197
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

252
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,326
This is sick.

253
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,288
This is awful.

254
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,999
Hey, guys!

255
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,542
Danger d here.

256
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,796
And we are at the foot
of this stomach-churningly massive

257
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,840
fourth-highest structure in the us.

258
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,718
We 're gonna begin our grueling journey

259
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,304
with an 1,800-foot ladder climb

260
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,806
inside a steel cage.

261
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,225
And then after the cage...

262
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:49,189
We have a zoo-foot, vertigo-inspiring
mast with an external ladder.

263
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,192
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

264
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,236
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

265
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,490
- The ledge. The top of the world, ma.
- Hunter?

266
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,538
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

267
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,624
Babe, of course you can.

268
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,667
No, um, I really can't. I'm, like...

269
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,338
I'm petrified. I'm, like, shaking.

270
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,881
I'm here.

271
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,091
Take a breath.

272
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,263
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own shadow.

273
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,350
But I pushed through.

274
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,977
I overcame the fear. I took control.

275
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:34,901
Do not let this fear consume you.
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

276
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,654
If you can beat it, you can beat anything.

277
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,866
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

278
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,995
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

279
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,333
So shut your shit and let's do this.

280
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,295
God, hunter.

281
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,382
You know, that's the kind of shit
you should be posting on Instagram.

282
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,842
Come on.

283
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,391
Dude, this is so cool.

284
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,850
Holy shit.

285
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,813
Look at this.

286
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,899
Damn it, hunter.
You are such an asshole.

287
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,778
- What are you getting us into?
- Don't worry.

288
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,947
We've got 50 feet of rope between us.

289
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,865
We're clipped in and we're all good.

290
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,493
Okay.

291
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,829
One rung at a time,
and let me know if you have to rest.

292
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,571
Okay, okay.

293
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,873
See?

294
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,374
It's easy.

295
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,212
Sure.

296
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,592
You're doing great. Come on.

297
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,179
You okay?

298
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,810
You're doing great.

299
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,936
Come on.

300
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,474
Hunter?

301
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,854
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

302
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,149
Can we rest a moment?
I need a drink.

303
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,650
Of course.

304
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,863
Those guylines means we're halfway up.

305
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,161
Perfect spot.

306
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,246
You wanna know something crazy?

307
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,665
What?

308
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,292
Halfway up?

309
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,253
That means we've climbed about 1,000 feet.

310
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,547
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

311
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,758
Please don't say shit like that, hunter.

312
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,470
Whoa!

313
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,055
There's the motel. And the diner.

314
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,976
No way. Looks like a little toy town.

315
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,941
- Let's just get this over with.
- Yeah.

316
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,072
Come on. Catch up.

317
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,469
That's it.

318
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,763
Becky, you're doing amazing.

319
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,852
Come on! Come on, Becky!

320
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,496
Okay.

321
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,998
This is the end of the internal ladder.

322
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,209
One step at a time, okay? You got this.

323
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,214
The next 200 feet is external.

324
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,340
I'm not gonna lie.

325
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,510
It's gonna get a little bit crazy
when we're out of the cage in the open.

326
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,886
But don't panic.

327
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,276
Hunter. Hunter!

328
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,860
Hunter! Hunter!

329
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,822
Becky! You gotta come up. It's so sick!

330
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,741
Okay.

331
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,756
- Hunter?
- I'm here.

332
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,551
It's just like 200 feet more, that's all.

333
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,721
- I can't!
- Yes, you can!

334
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:40,266
Just look up and only up.

335
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,107
You're doing great. You got this.

336
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,863
Okay. Okay.

337
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,417
Okay.

338
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,607
Yeah! You're killing it!

339
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,691
Whoo!

340
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,197
You're okay.

341
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,158
Remember, only look up.

342
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,916
What the hell are we doing?

343
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,001
Hey!

344
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,670
Stop overthinking.

345
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,463
- How?
- I don't know.

346
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,173
Concentrate on something else, like...

347
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,886
Sing a-a nursery rhyme or some shit.

348
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,432
Okay, okay.

349
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,850
Okay.

350
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,187
J“ ring around the roses j“

351
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,815
j“ pocket full of posies j“

352
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,735
j“ ashes, ashes, we all fall down j“

353
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,446
j" down! J”

354
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,658
I wouldn't have picked that one.

355
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,659
Wow.

356
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,161
Okay. Okay, becks,

357
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,415
this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

358
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,334
Ah, what the hell, hunter?
Let's just go back down!

359
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:39,635
Becky, if I let you go back now,
fear wins.

360
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,471
And I'm not going to let that happen.

361
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,091
It's okay, becks.

362
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:21,927
It's okay.

363
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,679
I've got your weight.

364
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,267
Thanks. Okay.

365
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,536
- Reach up. Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

366
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:56,879
Okay.

367
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,716
Smooth as sailing to the top now.
You got this.

368
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,596
I actually really do hate you, hunter.

369
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,016
Hey, does this ladder feel loose to you?

370
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,522
Stop, you click, hunter!

371
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,316
Sorry.

372
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,531
What was that?

373
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,410
Come on, we're almost there.

374
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,707
- Come on.
- Okay.

375
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,239
Wow.

376
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,537
Becky, you're not gonna believe this.
You gotta come up here.

377
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,621
I'm coming.

378
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,667
- Okay.
- Whoo!

379
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,960
Okay.

380
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,883
Hunter.

381
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,475
Hey, trust me.

382
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,437
Okay, okay.

383
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,908
Fuck, Becky!

384
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,784
Oh, I'm here. Oh, my god.

385
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,587
Oh, my god.

386
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,173
We did it, becks!
I knew you could.

387
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,718
Whoo!

388
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,694
Whoo!

389
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,907
Here we go!

390
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,038
- On top of the goddamn world!
- Whoo!

391
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,835
Do you wanna try?

392
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,214
Shit! Hunter, stop!

393
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,884
Just focus on getting a good shot.
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing.

394
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,179
- No, hunter.
- Whoo!

395
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,516
Swoop it around!

396
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,894
Seize your day!

397
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,188
Okay. Oh, my god.

398
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,576
How'd it look?

399
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,287
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

400
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,417
Let's get this bad boy back.

401
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,878
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

402
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,840
Okay. Now the ultimate, becks.

403
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,550
Your turn.

404
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,140
What? No.

405
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,100
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

406
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,477
No. No, hunter.

407
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,605
The old Becky would have done it.

408
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,484
- Just saying...
- Dude.

409
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,112
Here. I'll hold your hand.

410
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,495
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?

411
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,165
Shit.

412
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,293
Come on, come on!

413
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,919
You can do this.

414
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,925
- You can do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,180
- I got you.
- Okay.

416
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,681
Okay. Whoa!

417
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,391
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

418
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,185
- I've got you, becks.
- Oh, my god.

419
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,063
Careful over the ledge.

420
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,607
Take it easy.

421
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,234
Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

422
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,367
Open your eyes.

423
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,790
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,963
Okay, just one more.

425
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,887
You're coming up right now.

426
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,101
My god, you did it.

427
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,187
You did it! You did it, you idiot.

428
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,150
Yes! Look.

429
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,779
- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my god. Whoa!

430
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:21,036
Next time you are ever afraid of anything,

431
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,957
I want you to look at these and know
that you have nothing to be afraid of.

432
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,169
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

433
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,629
I'm really proud of you.

434
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,382
Dan would be, too.

435
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,896
Okay.

436
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,649
Okay, it's time.

437
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,605
You and I were one, Dan.

438
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:34,151
And whenever I needed a laugh,

439
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,737
you told me one of your shit jokes.

440
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,995
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on, it was yours.

441
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,375
And now you're gone and I'm...

442
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,964
I don't feel whole anymore.

443
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,348
I miss you, um, just so much and I'm...

444
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,809
I love you.

445
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,188
Goodbye, Dan.

446
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,625
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,836
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

448
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,050
I've just been so far away for so long.

449
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,552
It just didn't really feel real
until then.

450
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,892
Come on.

451
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:53,188
Let's get back down on earth, okay?

452
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,959
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

453
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,068
I've needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

454
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:00,904
Okay?

455
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,783
- Okay, home time.
- Home time.

456
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,952
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

457
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,875
Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.

458
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,585
Oh, stop.

459
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,465
- I've got you.
- Okay, slowly.

460
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,593
Okay.
Uh, I'm just getting a stitch here.

461
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,679
Okay, okay.

462
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,614
Okay.

463
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,090
Hunter!

464
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,156
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, holy shit.

465
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,119
- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.

466
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:34,247
Hunter!

467
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,382
Oh, god, please don't drop me.

468
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,261
Don't drop me.

469
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,817
Becks?

470
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,490
I've got you, becks.

471
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,745
I can see the ladder.

472
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,469
I've got you.

473
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,393
I just died almost.

474
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,231
Oh, my god.

475
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,692
Did that really just happen?

476
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,986
- Oh, my...
- Jesus Christ!

477
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,030
I wish we'd filmed that.

478
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,157
Oh, you're here.

479
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,076
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

480
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,454
Okay, take two.

481
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,382
Oh, no.

482
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:10,302
The ladder. It's gone.

483
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,113
Hunter, how do we get down?

484
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:32,699
- Shit!
- Please tell me there's a way to go down.

485
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,022
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

486
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,828
- No.
- Oh, no.

487
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,163
No, no, no.

488
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,665
Um, there must be something.

489
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,462
No. Shit. I don't have a signal.

490
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,466
I don't get it, either.

491
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,154
I'm sure there's something,
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.

492
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,430
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

493
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:56,515
We're gonna be okay.

494
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,478
Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.

495
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,812
We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform
in the middle of nowhere, hunter.

496
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,273
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

497
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,525
It's not gonna help, okay?

498
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,153
It's okay.

499
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:13,031
- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, hunter. Hunter, hunter.

500
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,241
Look at this.

501
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,117
Oh, my god.

502
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,912
- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.

503
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,163
We have a flare.

504
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,456
Okay.

505
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,501
Okay.

506
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,128
- This is great news.
- Okay. Great.

507
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,515
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

508
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,850
Oh, man, our water's in there.

509
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,770
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

510
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,480
- No. No.
- We don't have water.

511
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,750
- No, think about it...
- That's how you die when you're stranded.

512
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,151
The noise! The noise that this thing
made when it crashed,

513
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,488
there is no way nobody heard that. Okay?

514
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:57,534
I'm-I'm sure that there are, like,
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

515
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,663
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.

516
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,333
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just... we just have to wait.

517
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,294
Okay. Okay.

518
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,964
Holy...

519
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,275
- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.

520
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,260
My god.

521
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,012
What the hell?

522
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,638
I didn't even notice this.

523
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:20,932
Whoa!

524
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,058
- Um, whoa!
- Come here.

525
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,685
- Let's compress it.
- Ow!

526
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,080
- Are you okay? I know.
- It really hurts. Can you just like...

527
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,398
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.
- Can you warn me?

528
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,191
- Count of three?
- Yeah. One...

529
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,194
Two... sorry. I'm really sorry.

530
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,571
- I know.
- Oh, man.

531
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,531
Are you okay?

532
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,617
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

533
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:45,790
I really have to pee.

534
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,250
- Just go.

535
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,836
- Just pee.
- No, it's fine. I can hold it.

536
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,921
I just need to get comfortable.

537
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:04,142
Can you go any farther?
It's, like, spraying.

538
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,144
- Okay, careful over the ledge.
- I'm trying.

539
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,146
Stop looking at me.

540
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,066
Oh, god. That's a relief.

541
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,485
I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.

542
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,072
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

543
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,115
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

544
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,202
All right.

545
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,583
All right!

546
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,174
Do you really think someone's coming?

547
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,011
One million percent.

548
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,847
Hey, danger d, what's happening, guys?

549
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,725
I'll tell you what's happenin', Becky c.

550
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:31,521
We are stuck at the top
of a 2, 000-foot tower with no way down.

551
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,607
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

552
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,984
And no way to upload it.

553
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,945
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

554
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,238
It's quite ironic.

555
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,949
Well, don't worry,
you'll still be famous if you fall,

556
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:47,036
as the girl who died taking a selfie.
Now, that is ironic.

557
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,666
I would like to be remembered for my life,
not my death, thank you very much.

558
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,418
Hashtag, life over death.

559
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,837
Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.

560
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,007
Hashtag, hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money,

561
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,634
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

562
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:04,846
- It's not like that.
- Okay, what is it like, then?

563
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,266
Come on, show us who you are.
Show us Shiloh hunter.

564
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,186
Tell us why you vlog.

565
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,566
Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.

566
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,613
Secondly,

567
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,031
um... ahem...

568
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,994
And this is gonna sound stupid...

569
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,040
But I do this because of Dan.

570
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,047
What happened, it...

571
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,549
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

572
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,140
And I want to spread that message,
that life is short, too short.

573
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:52,310
So, you gotta use every moment.

574
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,397
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

575
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,576
That was amazing.

576
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,747
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

577
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,250
That was really great.

578
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:22,173
- Should I kill danger d?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,592
I'll help you Bury the body.

580
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,318
Oh, shit.

581
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,571
There's like an old rv thing down there.

582
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,657
- Can I see?
- Just past the gate, a little over.

583
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,162
Yeah. That looks abandoned.

584
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:59,002
It's been five hours. If anyone
called 911, they'd be here by now.

585
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:19,230
Oh, my god. Holy shit.

586
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,400
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

587
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,361
but we definitely did down there.
Remember I got all those likes?

588
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,405
Shit.

589
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,489
Okay.

590
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,700
Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service.

591
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,869
Maybe it was just up here
because of some, like,

592
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,954
- interference with the broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.

593
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,123
I think you're definitely
onto something, hunter.

594
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,875
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

595
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,627
We can try to fish for coverage.

596
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,962
I just need something to secure this with.

597
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,214
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

598
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,298
Okay.

599
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,802
Okay. Can you message
emergency services?

600
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,639
I don't think so. But I have
over 60,000 followers.

601
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:54,849
- Okay.
- "Help us.

602
00:48:54,933 --> 00:49:00,855
Stuck on 8-67 tower. Call 911

603
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,398
it's ready to post.

604
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,651
We should hear it when it sends.

605
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,575
Come on, come on.

606
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,912
Okay. Okay.

607
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,626
Let me see if I can get lower.

608
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,505
Just be careful.

609
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,800
Got it, okay. Come on.

610
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:35,598
That's the end.

611
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,892
- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't, either.

612
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,560
I don't think it posted.

613
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:45,692
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

614
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,235
What? What do you mean? Just...

615
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,653
I've got it. I've got an idea.

616
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,454
- Careful, hunter.
- Feels solid.

617
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

618
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,841
Okay.

619
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,802
- Oh, my god. Careful.
- Shit. Shit.

620
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,387
Oh, my god, hunter.

621
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,515
- Are you okay? Oh, my god.
- Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,103
Careful. Shit.

623
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,946
I don't hear anything. Nothing.

624
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,157
Okay, you need to come back up.

625
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,327
Shit.

626
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,295
I got it.

627
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,309
- Did it post?
- No.

628
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,146
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

629
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,026
Wait, hold on.

630
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,195
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

631
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,405
- Yeah.
- What if we just drop the phone?

632
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,969
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

633
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:20,078
Not if we reinforce it somehow,
so it doesn't like the egg drop challenge.

634
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,913
Yeah. Okay, shit.

635
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,957
Um, we just need something to...
To put it in.

636
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,585
- Yeah.
- This.

637
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,922
It's welded on. My shoe's too flimsy.

638
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,882
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

639
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,426
Okay, got it.

640
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:42,475
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

641
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,393
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,854
Okay.

643
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,776
We still need something more substantial.

644
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:56,114
Oh, hunter. Your push-up bra.

645
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,449
- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.

646
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,451
Dying to get this thing off, anyway.

647
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,163
Thank you, vs.

648
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:06,915
Okay.

649
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,085
Hope it's strong enough.

650
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,461
Shove it real good.

651
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,424
Okay.

652
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,220
Here goes nothing.

653
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,802
- Did it work?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

654
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,173
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

655
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,468
Don't worry. They're coming.

656
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:09,520
Holy shit! There's a freaking guy!

657
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:11,898
- What?
- Oh, my god. Yes.

658
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,191
And a dog, too.

659
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,278
- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!

660
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:23,117
Look, I sent you the check, man. Come on.

661
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,620
I need that...

662
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,538
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

663
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,003
Parker.

664
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,340
Come! Come on, boy.

665
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,799
No, no, no, no, no.

666
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,093
Shit!

667
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,932
Hey!

668
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,058
Let's go.

669
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,324
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

670
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,037
Parker.

671
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,164
He got the shoe.

672
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,000
- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!

673
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:22,718
- Hey!
- Hey!

674
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:23,802
- He's walking!
- Hey!

675
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,812
- No, no, no, turn around!
- Turn around!

676
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,063
Right here!

677
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,734
- Shit! Shit!
- Hey!

678
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,407
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Do not fire the flare, he's not looking.

679
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,158
This might be our only chance.

680
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,244
No, no, no, he's not looking.

681
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,289
Wait.

682
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,915
Hold on. There's somebody by the rv.

683
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:56,294
- He's setting up a grill or some shit.
- Okay.

684
00:54:56,377 --> 00:55:00,089
And we'll fire the flare when the sun goes
down in like... in like an hour.

685
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,452
We've only got one shot at this.

686
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,678
- Oh, damn.
- What?

687
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,306
- They're making ribs.
- Oh, no.

688
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,058
- And they have really cold beer.
- Don't.

689
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,618
These guys are definitely a couple.

690
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:32,872
Dirty weekend away.

691
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:33,956
I'm jealous.

692
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,976
Hey, hey, hey. They're finishing up.

693
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,811
It's now or never, fire the flare.

694
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,980
- Is it dark enough?
- Uh-huh.

695
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,316
Okay.

696
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,650
- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?

697
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,319
- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it.

698
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,047
I cocked it, maybe
there's a safety or something?

699
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:07,799
Shit. Okay, they're going in, they're
going in. You have to do the flare now.

700
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,217
- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Get it to go.

701
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,368
Okay, I got it. I got it.

702
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,085
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

703
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:21,337
- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.

704
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:26,300
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

705
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,386
Holy shit! Check this out.

706
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,721
Up here! Hey!

707
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,282
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

708
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,307
- What?
- They can see us.

709
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:34,517
Oh, my god!

710
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,810
Holy shit! Oh, my god,

711
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,312
let me see, let me see, let me see.

712
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:39,939
Oh, my god, they're coming.

713
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,274
Hey!

714
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,150
Holy shit, they found the car.
They found our car, they found our car.

715
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,745
They have a... a crowbar.
They're probably gonna open the gate.

716
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,456
- Okay.
- Okay.

717
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,042
- Wait, what the hell?
- Wait, what's going on?

718
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,044
- They stopped.
- What?

719
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:04,422
Quit chatting, go open the freakin' gate.

720
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:07,258
No. No, no, no. What the hell?

721
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,510
- They're stealing my freakin' car!
- What?

722
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,762
- No, you sons of bitches!
- Hey!

723
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,889
You asshole! What the hell?

724
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:15,975
No! I need to see it!

725
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,605
- Oh, my god. No, no!
- Die, you freakin' assholes!

726
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,034
Okay. New rule.

727
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,621
If somebody falls off the tower,

728
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:22,458
they bring the cell phone with them,
and call for help on the way down.

729
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,004
And maybe post that video.

730
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,966
Kidding-ish.

731
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,224
Yeah, my leg. I could eat aspirin
like skittles right now.

732
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,062
It's looking a little funky.

733
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,939
Could use some washing, here.

734
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,035
I'm sorry.

735
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,547
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

736
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:14,051
What's wrong?

737
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,598
Dan could never say the words,
"I love you."

738
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,520
1-4-3.

739
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,818
1-4-3.

740
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,367
- Becky, I...
- How long?

741
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,914
Four months.

742
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,546
It was a huge mistake.

743
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:55,259
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

744
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,845
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

745
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,472
For falling in love with the same guy.

746
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,380
Who made the move?

747
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,383
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

748
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:40,763
He did.

749
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:46,769
But it was a huge, huge mistake, becks.

750
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,731
No.

751
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,568
A mistake is a kiss, a one-night stand.

752
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,280
You said you loved him, so...

753
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,035
It got out of hand.

754
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:08,374
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

755
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,209
He listened to me, he was...

756
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:14,963
He was just different than every
other douchebag that I'd ever dated and...

757
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,176
And I'd never felt that way before.

758
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,989
And then you asked me to be
your maid of honor

759
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:26,183
and it all hit me like a ton of bricks,
how messed up this all was.

760
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,270
I loved him, but...

761
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,817
But I love you more, so I ended it.

762
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,532
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

763
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,910
And after Dan died, I...

764
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:49,248
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you,

765
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,625
to be strong enough for you, so...

766
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,461
So, I ran away.

767
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,048
And now you hate me and I don't blame you,

768
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,676
and now we're stuck on this stupid,
freaking tower

769
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,386
in the middle of freaking nowhere.

770
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,389
And it's all my fault.

771
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,935
I am so, so sorry.

772
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,302
What's that?

773
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:29,139
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

774
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,352
It's been 24 hours.

775
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:39,817
I think it's time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit

776
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,319
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

777
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:44,780
Okay.

778
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,076
Well, we've got one more shot. Your phone.

779
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,037
Yeah, no padding this time, though.
Even less of a chance.

780
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,998
And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.

781
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,295
How long till we die of thirst?

782
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,050
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

783
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,303
Yeah, with the drone.

784
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,889
We could've used that to get help.

785
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:14,810
We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old fashioned note.

786
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,067
Wait, maybe I can get it.

787
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,363
What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth. No footholds.

788
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,206
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

789
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,492
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

790
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:35,289
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

791
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,709
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

792
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,511
Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.

793
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:52,306
Becky, I don't think we have a choice.

794
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,433
Every hour that passes, the weaker we get.

795
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,063
Besides...

796
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,066
Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll fall.

797
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,120
Hunter.

798
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:19,917
Be careful.

799
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,463
I'm sorry, becks.

800
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:26,924
I love you.

801
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,103
Okay.

802
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:52,282
Are you okay?

803
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,367
Yeah.

804
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,078
Yeah, all good.

805
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,628
Okay.

806
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:12,928
Okay.

807
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:21,937
Hunter, careful.

808
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,190
Shit.

809
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,402
I can't quite reach it.

810
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,405
- Come back up. We'll attach it lower.
- Come on.

811
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,407
Shit.

812
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,704
I think I can drop myself lower.

813
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,580
What?

814
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,083
What the hell are you doing, hunter?

815
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:45,460
Hunter!

816
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,427
Shit.

817
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,855
- I think I can swing to it.
- Hunter, no!

818
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,190
Hunter! Come back up!

819
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:08,525
Hunter, no!

820
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,985
Hunter!

821
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,659
Are you okay?

822
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,621
Yeah.

823
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,669
Is there a way down?

824
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:30,922
No. The ladder ripped all the way off.

825
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,691
- Oh, my god.
- Wait, hunter.

826
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,985
How are you gonna get back on the rope?

827
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,114
Uh.

828
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,326
Shit.

829
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:03,163
Can... can you reach it?

830
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,301
J“ humpty dumpty sat on the wall j“

831
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,553
oh, my god.

832
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:21,848
J“ humpty dumpty had a big fall... j“

833
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:35,362
Shit.

834
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,952
- You okay?
- Yeah.

835
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,745
I have an idea.

836
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,297
Okay.

837
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:57,092
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this,

838
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,845
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

839
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,264
- Okay?
- That's amazing.

840
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,891
That's some good MacGyver shit
right there.

841
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,172
Oh, come on. Please. Come on.

842
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,427
- You did it!
- Okay.

843
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,097
Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.

844
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,266
I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.

845
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,684
- Okay.
- Get ready, becks.

846
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:48,768
- Okay.
- Okay.

847
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:51,646
Okay.

848
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,819
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

849
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:07,996
Shit.

850
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,415
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

851
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,670
Okay. I'm okay.

852
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:17,714
Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.

853
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,257
Work together to pull me up.

854
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:22,677
- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.

855
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,806
Okay? Okay, now!

856
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:58,922
I can almost reach the ladder.

857
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,511
Almost there, becks.

858
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,894
Okay.

859
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:46,720
Becky! I landed on the bag!

860
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,847
Oh, my god... are you okay?

861
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,517
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

862
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,477
You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?

863
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:55,812
Okay. Okay.

864
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:00,859
I got you.

865
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:42,525
Oh, shit.

866
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,694
Oh, no. Are you okay?

867
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:47,322
Shit. I thought you died there.

868
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:50,033
I'm not going anywhere, becks.

869
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,659
Yeah, that was scary.

870
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,337
- We should ration it.
- Okay. You're right.

871
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,924
Is there any food in there?

872
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,009
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

873
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:10,178
I don't think you can eat that.

874
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:14,265
Okay, it's getting dark.
I think it's now or never on that drone.

875
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,520
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

876
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,648
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

877
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:25,235
- A pen... do you have a pen?
- Eyeliner in here.

878
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,638
Aren't you glad I brought up makeup now?

879
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,241
"Help.

880
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:36,496
Stuck on top of 8-67 tower.
Call 911

881
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,749
yeah, perfect.

882
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,089
Okay. See that?

883
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,675
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

884
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,136
It leads to the motel.

885
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,221
Let's do this while we still have light.

886
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,184
Okay.

887
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:03,189
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

888
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:05,275
- Let it drift down as it goes.
- Okay.

889
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,832
Okay.

890
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,834
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

891
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,353
Oh, my god.

892
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,021
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

893
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,047
- It's running out ofjuice.
- Oh, shit.

894
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,675
Hit retrieve. Or has it gone too far?

895
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,635
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!

896
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,439
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

897
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,763
Shit. It's dropping.

898
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,116
- Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
- Hunter.

899
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,183
- Hit retrieve.
- Okay.

900
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,077
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

901
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,702
Give it the best shot to get back to us.

902
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,731
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

903
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,318
- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.

904
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,030
- We'll grab it when it gets close.
- Okay.

905
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,368
Okay. We've got this.

906
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,246
Get it, becks, get it.

907
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,627
Nice! Good job.

908
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:21,100
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

909
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,270
Maybe just turn it off and once it's
rested, it will have morejuice.

910
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:26,898
It's never gonna be enough. Hunter.

911
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,076
What are we gonna do?

912
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,495
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

913
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,997
We're gonna stay calm.

914
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:45,917
We're gonna figure it out, okay?
There's gotta be a way.

915
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,799
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

916
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,385
No, we're gonna be okay.

917
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,332
Hunter. Hunter...

918
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,918
Where are you? Hunter...

919
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,342
Hunter...

920
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,847
Hunter, where are you?

921
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,020
Hunter. Hunter!

922
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,209
Becky, it's okay.

923
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,170
You just had a bad dream.

924
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:59,467
You're nice and safe,
2,000 feet up in the middle of nowhere.

925
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:10,395
I have an idea.

926
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,021
How to charge the drone.

927
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,274
Your dumb life hack.

928
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,444
Becky, you freakin' genius.

929
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:28,121
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

930
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:50,852
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
but it's gonna be hot.

931
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,062
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like 1,000.

932
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,985
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

933
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:02,363
It smells, but it doesn't hurt
anymore. It's fine.

934
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,824
Okay.

935
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,664
You can do this.

936
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,465
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

937
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,095
Keep going, Becky.

938
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,642
You got this, Becky.

939
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,323
- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

940
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,200
I can't.

941
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,659
You can do it, Becky.

942
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,286
You got it.

943
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,919
It's okay. It's just like pole dancing.

944
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:00,713
Um... okay, "cherry pie."

945
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:03,549
J“ she's my cherry pie j“

946
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:06,636
j“ my cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise j“

947
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,554
j“ she's my cherry pie j“

948
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,017
J“ making my cherry pie j“

949
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,685
whoo!

950
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:17,063
J“ she's my cherry pie j“

951
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,274
j“ my cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise j“

952
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,652
j“ she's my cherry pie j“

953
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,735
whoo!

954
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:26,030
J“ Becky's my cherry pie j“

955
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:28,783
yes!

956
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:36,123
You did it, my little cherry pie.

957
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,208
Good job!

958
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,754
- Okay.
- Yeah!

959
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,966
You did it, cherry pie!

960
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,426
All right. All right.

961
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:50,513
- Okay. Okay.
- Remember, it's hot.

962
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,058
Be careful.

963
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:15,079
Okay, just think back to the diner.

964
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,415
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

965
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,042
with the elements of the bulb socket.

966
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,216
I don't think it's long enough.

967
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,093
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

968
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:33,848
Okay, you're gonna need something small
and metal to carry the current, like a...

969
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:37,226
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

970
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,854
- There isn't anything.
- Jesus. Um...

971
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:11,385
It's working! It's freaking working!

972
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:13,429
Holy shit, my hero!

973
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,098
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

974
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:18,768
I don't know. It just has four lights.

975
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,313
Okay, we have to charge it all the way.
Give ourselves the best shot.

976
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,231
You gonna be okay?

977
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,651
Yeah. I got this.

978
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,433
You okay?

979
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,186
Hang in there, becks.

980
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:05,106
Past halfway.

981
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,130
Get off of me!

982
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:38,848
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

983
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,100
Three lights.

984
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:48,232
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

985
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,199
Get the hell away from me!

986
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,373
You did it!

987
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,381
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

988
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,095
- Why didn't you catch the bag?
- Uh...

989
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,598
Babe, you okay?

990
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:30,691
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

991
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,818
Checkout, 10:00 am.

992
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:35,404
Just a couple of hours.

993
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:07,228
You know, he was right about Dan.
He was just trying to help me and...

994
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:12,441
And I was so horrible to him.

995
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,863
If there was anyone
I could text, it would be him.

996
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,658
Just to say...

997
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,326
I'm so sorry.

998
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,330
I love him.

999
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,714
I'm tapping out here.

1000
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:39,468
Stay with me.
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1001
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,180
Tell me something, something that...

1002
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:45,266
That you and your dad used to do together.

1003
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:50,855
We would watch wrestling.

1004
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:55,109
- Wwe.
- Yeah.

1005
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,194
I forgot you guys were into that.

1006
01:25:57,278 --> 01:26:00,990
Yeah. It was our thing, you know?

1007
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:05,744
He was always said I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1008
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:10,624
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1009
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:16,130
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

1010
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,927
Uh, "stone cold" Steve Austin.

1011
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,889
The rock.

1012
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,560
What was cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1013
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:30,853
Mankind.

1014
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:33,856
Mankind.

1015
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,735
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1016
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,486
I didn't.

1017
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:41,572
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

1018
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,409
Batista.

1019
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:53,125
Okay. It's checkout time.

1020
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,380
Okay, here it goes.

1021
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:08,766
Just keep that shit straight.
Follow the line of the road.

1022
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,522
Come on, you son of a...

1023
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:25,574
I'm past the point of no return,
so how's the battery?

1024
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:26,909
Should I retrieve?

1025
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,203
No, keep going.

1026
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:34,667
Come on, come on, just follow the road.

1027
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:42,466
Oh, shit.

1028
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,557
It's gonna work.

1029
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:00,567
Oh, god.

1030
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,948
No.

1031
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:11,495
Screw your truck.
Get the drone! Get it!

1032
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,295
No, no, no, no!

1033
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:22,256
Go back! Go back.

1034
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:25,801
No, no, no. Go back!

1035
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,094
Go back!

1036
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,934
Fuck, no!

1037
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,526
Is that a storm?

1038
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:28,697
It's kind of beautiful from up here.

1039
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,206
I can't survive another night.

1040
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,500
Becky, don't talk like that.

1041
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,004
I just...

1042
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:47,466
- I just wanna sleep.
- You can't sleep.

1043
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,052
The vultures, they can smell your leg.

1044
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,763
They're waiting for you
to give up so they can attack.

1045
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:58,185
Survival of the fittest.

1046
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:01,146
You need energy.

1047
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,148
We should eat something.

1048
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:08,654
What? We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert.

1049
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:12,157
- There's no food up here.
- There's always something.

1050
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:17,204
It's hopeless.

1051
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,544
Let's send another message.

1052
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:25,796
We can pad the cell better this time.

1053
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,132
- With what?
- Give me your shoe.

1054
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:30,926
- I can't.
- Why?

1055
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:33,637
- It's not up here, is it?
- What?

1056
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,724
It's down there.

1057
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:42,020
It's on your foot.

1058
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,276
I'm...

1059
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:51,238
Down there, remember?

1060
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,203
I fell.

1061
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:04,209
You can't have the shoe,

1062
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:06,378
because I didn't catch the bag.

1063
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,298
I bled out.

1064
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:30,402
You didn't really think your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

1065
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,792
You pulled the bag up.

1066
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,637
I guess you were just too afraid

1067
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,139
to realize that you were up here...

1068
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,559
All alone.

1069
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:19,469
Hi, dad.

1070
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:23,599
I wanted you to know that I...

1071
01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:26,643
I found my fight again.

1072
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:31,940
Please leave your message...

1073
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,068
I wanna live.

1074
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,196
I wanna go home...

1075
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:43,785
But I'm not gonna make it.

1076
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:51,627
You were right about everything and I...

1077
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:55,130
I'm sorry, dad.

1078
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:05,182
By the time you see this...

1079
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,391
I'll be gone.

1080
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:16,276
[Love you.

1081
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:55,125
That's it! Fuck!

1082
01:36:18,482 --> 01:36:20,942
You need energy.

1083
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:23,487
You should eat something.

1084
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,618
Survival of the fittest.

1085
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:09,741
I can pad the cell better this time.

1086
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:11,326
Give me your shoe.

1087
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:31,239
Hunter.

1088
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,088
God, I love you.

1089
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:22,040
I'm sorry.

1090
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:25,669
I'm so sorry, but I really have
to make sure this gets through.

1091
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,587
God, god, I'm sorry.

1092
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,209
You can't park here.

1093
01:40:48,293 --> 01:40:50,837
Becky! Becky!

1094
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:05,852
Dad?

1095
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:06,935
Dad?

1096
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:09,773
Dad!

1097
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,323
I thought that was you.

1098
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:22,243
Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.

1099
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:24,913
It's okay.

1100
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:30,085
I just... I just want you to be okay.

1101
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,092
I am, you know? I'm gonna be okay.

1102
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:39,511
Really.

1103
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:56,653
Let's go home.

1104
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:01,533
Life is fleeting.

1105
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,868
Life is short.

1106
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:08,706
So, you gotta use every moment.

1107
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,960
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

1108
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:13,962
And that shit?

1109
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:18,258
That would spread that message
far and wide.
