-What?

00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,291
Well, everyone's got a codename.
You even got a new one. I want a codename.

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,376
Find the bomb and then we'll talk.

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,254
I'm scanning frequency signatures.
I just know we're not gonna talk about it.

7
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,672
John, you've got a runner.

8
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:50,883
I'm on it.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,472
Got it. Ghosts' frequency of choice is on
the ground level.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,229
like it's good, like, "It's the bomb!"
I mean like it's the explosive.

12
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,938
Got it. Ground floor.

00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157

(BEEPING)

17
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,337
It's done. Get Diggle down here
to handle the dismantling.

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,214
You know, it seems like he could
use a codename, too.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,632
Just get him down here.

20
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,853
{\an8}Saving the city's water supply, that's
an honest night's... Morning's work.

{\an8}(SCOFFS)

22
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,690
{\an8}Yeah, but no matter what we do,
these Ghosts, they keep coming.

23
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,817
{\an8}We still did a good job tonight.

24
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,068
{\an8}Yeah, not good enough.

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,945
{\an8}Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

26
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,491
{\an8}Kind of felt like you were
out there for blood tonight.

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,951
{\an8}Look, you haven't been dealing with these
Ghosts as long as we have.

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}If I go easy on them,
things are gonna end bad really fast.

29
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,375
{\an8}I'm worried that if you keep going the way
that you're going,

30
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,627
{\an8}you're going to put one
of them down permanently.

31
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,465
{\an8}I know where the line ends, okay?
And look, it's almost 9:00.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,385
{\an8}Mrs. Danforth and Madison are gonna be
at our house in, like, an hour.

33
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,682
{\an8}So I have time for one of your lectures
or a shower. I pick shower.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,270
{\an8}Is everything okay?

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,939
{\an8}You look nice.

36
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:31,234
{\an8}It's my first day back at Palmer Tech.
I get to be bossy today

37
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,654
{\an8}because I am the boss of a
multibillion-dollar corporation.

38
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,158
{\an8}I know I should be nervous, I know,
but I'm not. I'm actually really excited.

39
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:43,330
You should be excited. That's why I got
you the first-day-as-a-boss fern.

40
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,497
Aw.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,502
And packed your lunch.

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,128
Who are you?

43
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,423
Who are you?

44
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,883
-(GROANS)
-Answer me!

45
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,597
{\an8}All right.

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,551

{\an8}Come on.

49
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,523
{\an8}OLIVER: <i>Madison, how's school?</i>

50
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,401
{\an8}It's good. I graduate in May
with a degree in Ancient Philosophy.

51
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,781
{\an8}Ancient Philosophy? What happened to
your dream of being J.T.'s backup dancer?

52
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,242
{\an8}-That's still plan B, obviously.
-(LAUGHING)

53
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,202
{\an8}It is so lovely to see you two. Really.
It's been far too long.

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,913
{\an8}No, Thea and I were glad you got in touch.

55
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,916
{\an8}Yeah, we were a little surprised though.

56
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,919
{\an8}Well, I admit that
reconnecting with the son and daughter

57
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:17,924
{\an8}of one of my dearest friends is not the
only reason that I wanted to see you.

58
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,926
{\an8}And here comes the crazy.

59
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,721
{\an8}Last week, like the rest of the city,
I saw the Green Arrow's broadcast.

60
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,014
{\an8}And it hit me.

61
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,476
{\an8}If that man could take up the Arrow's
mantle, I could take up your mother's.

62
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,603
Um, how?

63
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,939
By running for mayor.

64
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,191
See, I told you. Crazy.

65
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,570
No one's opposing me, obviously.
But there'll still need to be an election.

66
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,530
There's a very good reason that no one
else is running.

67
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,657
Yeah, the last three mayors
have been killed.

68
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,117
{\an8}To say nothing of the city's leadership
last week.

69
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,412
{\an8}Which is exactly why we need
a mayor more than ever.

70
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,665
{\an8}I want to step forward,
and I'm asking for your support.

71
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,140
{\an8}Wow. You guys look bigger than you did
when you were on my computer screen.

72
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,604
{\an8}Perhaps, we should begin with this
quarter's financials.

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,774
{\an8}Thank you. Uh... Okay.

74
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,487
{\an8}I know I don't have a business degree
or an accounting degree or an MBA,

75
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,031
{\an8}but this looks very, very bad.

76
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,159
These are hard times
for everyone in Star City.

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,786
This company is not immune.

78
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,456
Fortunately, Mr. Holt
has devised us a way out.

79
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,165
Oh. Goody.

80
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:38,170
{\an8}Um... Hello. (CHUCKLES) I'm actually not
a member of the board.

81
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,632
{\an8}I work in the
Design Innovations department.

82
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,675
{\an8}Tell Ms. Smoak about your algorithm.

83
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,177
{\an8}It's pretty simple, actually.

84
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,346
{\an8}I used specialized A.I.
to determine maximum profits

85
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,974
{\an8}which can be derived with a minimal
amount of workforce reduction.

86
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,854
{\an8}Sorry. I probably could've
explained that better.

87
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,105
{\an8}FELICITY: <i>No. I got the gist.</i>

88
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,441
{\an8}You came up with a list
of people that you'd like me to fire.

89
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,528
{\an8}"Workforce reduction"
has a nicer sound to it.

90
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,488
{\an8}It's just kind of rolls off the tongue.
(CLEARS THROAT)

91
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,532
{\an8}Yeah. Well, the only thing
we'll be reducing

92
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,949
{\an8}is all of your bonuses, to start.

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,828
We've already been down that road and
exhausted all other avenues, Ms. Smoak.

94
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,416
I didn't come back to this company to put
the people who work here out of work.

95
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,251
I came here to protect
Ray Palmer's legacy.

96
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,422
And if we do not dramatically reduce our
costs or increase our profits,

97
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,090
there won't be a legacy to protect.

98
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,804
Am I the only one that has
a bad feeling about this?

99
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,891
I mean, signing up to be mayor of this
town is like asking to be part of <i>Titanic.</i>

100
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,851
You heard me try to talk
her out of running.

101
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,521
I'm pretty sure that got covered up

102
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,230
by you telling her we'd be at her big
announcement.

103
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,191
MAN: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Jessica Danforth.</i>

104
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,901
(APPLAUSE)

105
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,405
<i>Thank you. Thank you all so much.</i>

106
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,993
<i>For the past six months, the mayor's
office at City Hall has stood vacant,</i>

107
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,581
<i>waiting for someone to step forward
on behalf of Star City.</i>

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,877
<i>And today, I am here with all of you
to tell you that I am stepping forward.</i>

109
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,046
(APPLAUSE)

110
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>Two years ago, I lost my good friend,
Moira Queen,</i>

111
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,430
<i>who was also a candidate for mayor.</i>

112
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,226
<i>And I remain inspired by her kind heart
and her selfless devotion to this city.</i>

(GUNFIRE)

114
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,112
Shots came from up there. No, no, no.
You protect Jessica, okay? I've got this.

115
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,492
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

116
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,875
The shots are just a distraction!
There's no Ghosts up here.

117
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,338
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
You're not on her detail.

118
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,182
Get back to the atrium!

119
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,476
Oliver, how...

120
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,977
Uh... Self-defense classes.

121
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,356
She announces her candidacy

122
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,358
and two seconds later
someone's trying to kill her?

123
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
That must be a record, even for our city.

124
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,237
And she's not dropping out of the race,
so this isn't over.

125
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,239
My father has a protective detail on her.

126
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,241
Yeah, but even with protection
at the announcement,

127
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,492
she didn't seem to be too safe.

128
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,828
Is it just me or is the shooting of a

129
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,830
potential city leader
feeling a little Ghost-y?

130
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,040
This guy wasn't wearing a mask so...

131
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,587
There was something else different
about him. He left behind evidence.

132
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,840
DIGGLE: <i>Fingerprints.</i>

133
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,550
How'd you get the
owner to part with his windshield?

134
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,426
I bought his truck.

135
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,261
It's one of the benefits
of your girlfriend inheriting

136
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:18,515
a multibillion dollar conglomerate.
We have money now.

137
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,227
I don't exactly think
that was money well spent.

138
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,229
I don't think these prints
are gonna do us any good.

139
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:26,398
What the hell?

140
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,443
I'm not an expert, but I think our new
friend may have cut off his fingertips

141
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,320
and played a little bit of mix and match.

142
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll keep digging. Maybe this is an M.O.
that'll tell us something.

143
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,408
In the meantime, we backstop the SCPD.

144
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,870
Thea was right. Jessica needs
more than the police can offer.

145
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,206
She's in protective custody and I'm
pretty sure my father wouldn't be in favor

146
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,041
of us staking out his precinct.

147
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,334
I'll talk to him.

148
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,253
Oh, yeah. That'll definitely go over well.

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,840
Mrs. Danforth is under our protection,
24/7,

150
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,424
until this nutbar's in cuffs.

151
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,552
Do you have a minute?

152
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,727
Caught your TV debut.
Guess you decided to stick around.

153
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,396
It's gonna be different this time.

154
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,482
Yeah, yeah, sure it will, 'cause you got
a new name, now, right? With a color.

155
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,778
"Green Arrow." It's catchy. (CHUCKLES)

156
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,947
Jessica Danforth is a friend.

157
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,323
We would like to help keep her safe.

158
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,659
With everything this city's facing,

159
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,160
I thought you could use
all the help you could get.

160
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,913
You've been gone.
You don't know what this city's facing.

161
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,249
Well, I'm not saying
it doesn't need saving.

162
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,502
But a guy hiding behind
a mask isn't gonna get it done.

163
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,924
What this city needs is someone willing to
stand up in the light of day,

164
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,884
not a guy lurking around in the shadows.

165
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,139
You say you're gonna be different
this time, huh? How?

166
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,753
You're late.

167
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,046
I know. Sorry. I was looking at
the numbers again and...

168
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,549
Oh, you mean the "numbers" of people that
your magic "downsizing algorithm"

169
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,760
is making us fire today.

170
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,554
-Downsizing... You think I... I didn't.
-Let's get one thing straight.

171
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,933
The only person who is allowed to talk in
sentence fragments around here is me.

172
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,104
I developed my algorithm
to create a value matrix.

173
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,982
To argue for company-wide
pay increases. Raises.

174
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,360
Mr. Dennis turned it around and had me
use it to figure out who to fire.

175
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,570
So this wasn't your idea?

176
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,783
I was trying to get people to get paid
more, not paid nothing.

177
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,868
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

178
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,956
Hi. I'm Karla Groves.
My supervisor asked me to come see you.

179
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:33,752
Hi. Yes. Um...
I don't know quite how to say this...

180
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,547
I'm fired.

181
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,965
But clearly you do.

182
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,676
As rumors go,
downsizing ones tend to go viral.

183
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,264
I'm very sorry. I didn't come back here to
put people out of work.

184
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,393
But I am hoping that by losing a few jobs,
I can save many, many more.

185
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,521
That looks like a little more than a few.

186
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,903
Yes. The company is going
through a difficult time.

187
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,112
I know.

188
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,949
And when we heard you were coming back,
we thought things were going to get

189
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,158
a lot better.

190
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,119
Guess we were wrong.

191
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm still hungry.
Is it wrong that I'm still hungry? John?

192
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,675
Shift change is in 10 minutes.

193
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,597
You know, for the past week, you've been
pretty intense.

194
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,599
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

195
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,893
And don't tell me
it's because Oliver is back.

196
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,895
Well, I'm not happy Oliver's back.

197
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,272
Yeah, you weren't exactly
subtle about that.

198
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,149
(SIGHS) Just let it go, Laurel.

199
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,403
No, because we don't keep secrets,
remember?

200
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,366
John, what's going on?

201
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,371
Remember last week,
when Oliver was telling us about Darhk?

202
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,499
He said he had a hive of followers.

203
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,044
An organization called
H.I.V.E. killed my brother.

204
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,132
I didn't know.

205
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,010
Do you think it's some
kind of coincidence?

206
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,180
No. I've been looking into this
organization for two years now.

207
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,016
<i>All dead ends.</i>

208
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,394
But what I did manage to dig up tracks
with what we know about Darhk's Ghosts.

209
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:15,687
They're H.I.V.E.

210
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,275
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

211
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,692
No.

212
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,363
You've been investigating this for
two years and you haven't told anyone?

213
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,781
This is a family thing, Laurel,

214
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:30,036
I would think you of all people would
understand keeping secrets

215
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,495
when it comes to the death of a sibling.

216
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,080
I do.

217
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,918
And because I do, I can tell you,
carrying a burden like that,

218
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,378
it never ends in any way but bad.

219
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,890
That was quite the show.

220
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,559
False machine gun.
Impersonating a bodyguard.

221
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:57,729
You've the flair for the dramatic,
Mr. Machin. I will give you that.

222
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,233
Too bad it was all for nothing.

223
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,528
Half of your fee has been
wired into your account.

224
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,447
This isn't about money for me.

225
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,408
I know. You came to me with promises.

226
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,412
You wanted to impress yourself to my
organization, and you failed.

227
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:20,169
I'm not done yet. Just give me more time.

228
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,216
I will make sure that Jessica Danforth
does not run for mayor.

229
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,888
Very well. However, a word of caution.

230
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,393
I'm not sure how Rick Pinzolo runs his
operation, but H.I.V.E. does not believe

231
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,812
in third chances. Good night.

232
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,118
Spoke to Diggle.
No movement at the precinct.

233
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,329
That's all right.
I may have some movement here.

234
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,165
I noticed something tacky on the palm
print our guy left on the windshield.

235
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,127
-Tacky?
-Like a residue.

236
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,294
What kind?

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,384
Cellulose.
Oh, except this formulation is special.

238
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,551
The molecular structure's been patented.

239
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,927
By who?

240
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,304
Palmer Technologies.

241
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,056
A subsidiary, actually. Palmer Paper.

242
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,808
I had to shut down the mill a couple
months ago as a cost-cutting measure.

243
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,810
Where's the paper mill?

244
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,490
Hey, stay sharp.
He has some sort of electricity weapon.

245
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,205
The man in the photo, have you seen him?

246
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,751
I don't see much. I like my sleep.

247
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,174
But that guy, he sees a lot. He deals
outta here. Does a lot of business.

248
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,803
Hey, we need to ask you a few questions.

249
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,096
Step off, freak.

250
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,516
Have you seen this guy here?
I want a name.

251
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,685
You masks, you think you're in charge.

252
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah, well, maybe you were,
but not anymore.

253
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,605
-There are new masks in charge.
-(GROANS)

254
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,652
I asked you. Have you seen this guy here?
Do you still wanna use your arm?

255
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,279
Let him go!

256
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,073
You still think you're in charge?

257

-(GROANING)
-Hey! Get out of here!

(GROANING)

260
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,672
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

261
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,842
I thought his fingerprints were
all screwed up.

262
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,719
Mixed up. But I have an obsession
with jigsaw puzzles.

the Triad, Rick Pinzolo...

265
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,229
We're going to talk about this.

266
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,190
We're going to have a conversation
about what just happened.

267
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,691
What just happened was that guy had

268
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,651
information and I was
trying to get it out of him!

269
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,362
-You broke his arm.
-He was stalling!

270
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,738
He was scared. Come here!

271
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:53,905
What are you doing?

272
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,658
I'll just show you something.
At the water-plant, you took down a Ghost.

273
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,662
You could have done it with a very
simple disarming technique. Like this.

274
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,916
Thea, that's not what you did.

with a series of techniques
designed to do one thing, cripple!

It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

After Ra's hurt you,

286
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,339
Malcolm warned me
not to take you to Nanda Parbat.

287
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,384
He said that when people go in the Pit,

288
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,470
they don't come out the same.

289
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,723
And I didn't tell you because
I didn't wanna worry about you.

290
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,809
You seemed normal, Thea.

291
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,936
And I swear to God,
I thought everything was gonna be fine.

292
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,858
And then you left. So you know what?

293
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:16,029
It doesn't really qualify you to judge me,
or anyone else!

294
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,954
What's going on?
What happened to Thea in Nanda Parbat?

295
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,960
I did what I had to do to save my sister.

296
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,546
That was six months ago.

297
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,340
Why is the Pit only affecting her now?

298
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,426
It's probably been showing up over time.
Subtly.

299
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,096
So what do you want to do about it?

300
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,894
You! Hey! Stay down!

301
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,356
I guess you know what happened to Kenny.

302
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,065
-Don't move! Don't move!
-Just shut up!

303
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,277
That's a minefield, all right?
That's what killed your friend.

304
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,862
And who the hell are you?

305
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,030
My name is Oliver Queen.

306
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,034
Three years ago, the yacht that I was on
went down in a storm.

307
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,996
I washed up here. I survived.

308
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,749
Let's take him to Reiter.
He'll know what to do with him.

309
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,009
Wow. You look like someone who has
to fire a whole mess of people today.

310
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:25,432
What? Oh, no. I mean, yes.
But this isn't about this.

311
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:29,060
Not that firing a dozen people is going
to do much for my mood.

312
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,729
Actually, it's two dozen.

313
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,189
-What?
-The pages are double-sided.

314
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,319
But there has to be another way.

315
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,196
This many intelligent people in the
company, there has to be someone who...

316
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,699
Ms. Smoak? Are you all right?

317
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,327
Absolutely.

318
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,458
-It's okay.
-What is?

319
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm on the list, aren't I?

320
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,462
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

321
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,508
It's okay. It means one less person that
you have to fire today, right?

322
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,845
You know, actually, this is good news
in a way. My husband'll be thrilled.

323
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,683
I mean, this way, we can take that trip
that he's been wanting to go on.

324
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,101
Of course, I'll have to drive.

325
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,563
You don't have to try and make me feel
better about this.

326
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,858
About what? I sort of fired myself.

327
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,369
Come to visit me in my confinement?

328
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,413
I thought you could use some company.

329
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,122
And a little, "I told you so"?

330
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,375
Oh, I didn't bring it.

331
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,878
You know, that being said,
it's not too late for you to drop out.

332
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,797
And send what message?

333
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,508
That on top of the city's other problems,
we give in to terrorism?

334
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,385
The people here deserve better.

335
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,347
They deserve someone to be brave for them.

336
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,848
That's what the Green Arrow is for.

337
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,475
He's not enough.

338
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,312
Yes, the Green Arrow risks his life to
keep the people of the city safe,

339
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,856
but who inspires them?

340
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,860
You know, who works to make sure
that there's a city worth saving?

341
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,864
Who's there to make Star City a place
that my daughter wants to call home?

342
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,157
Where is Madison?

343
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,453
Oh. Library. Poor kid has finals so I sent
her back to school.

344
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,040
Don't worry. Captain Lance sent her with
more than enough cops to keep her safe.

345
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,294
Maybe you should call her.

346
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,678
(PHONE RINGING)

347
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:43,779
To the man who took my daughter, please,
I am begging you. Please let my baby go.

348
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:50,285
She's all I have. She's my whole world.

349
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,709
Killed the officers escorting her
with some kinda weapon.

350
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,754
Shot them up with five thousand volts,
slit their throats for good measure.

351
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,173
His name is Lonnie Machin.

352
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:04,883
Do I even want to know
how you got that intel?

353
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,887
You can't do this alone. You know that.
Now, two of your guys are down.

354
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,722
Now let us help.

355
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
What is this place?

356
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,313
Over there.

357
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,360
Baron, this guy says he's...

358
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,573
Oliver Queen. You don't recognize him?

359
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:32,619
This man's a minor celebrity
on the other side of the world.

360
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,954
You're supposed to be dead.

361
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,414
Nearly was.

362
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,084
Thank you for rescuing me.

363
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm sorry, but we're not rescuing you.

364
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,172
The first thing you do once you get home

365
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,549
is tell people what
it is we're doing here.

366
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,759
I don't know what you're doing here.

367
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,637
Be that as it may, I can't send you home.

368
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,430
Not right now.

369
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,059
Good news, though,
I've no reason to kill you.

370
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,229
So what are you gonna do to me?

371
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,231
Good question.

372
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,442
You've survived three years here.
All alone.

373
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,488
That requires fortitude, intelligence.

374
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,114
Qualities that are of use to me.

375
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,619
As it happens, one of my men stepped
on a land mine.

376
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,831
How would you like his job?

377
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,467
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

378
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,639
What did you do?
Where is Jessica Danforth's daughter?

379
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,311
Did you catch the news earlier?

380
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,273
Ms. Danforth,
begging for her daughter's life.

381
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,233
She'll do anything to get her back.

382
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,530
Or not do anything. Like run for mayor.

383
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,448
All I have to do is make a phone call.

384
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,994
Now I see why Rick Pinzolo banished you.

385
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,289
You're unaware that there are lines
one does not cross.

386
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,047
I met one of your Ghosts.

387
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,177
After I took his tooth, we had an
interesting conversation about H.I.V.E.

388
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,014
I wasn't led to believe
you respected lines.

389
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,684
I respect order, Mr. Machin.

390
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,395
Discipline. Precision. You are sloppy.

391
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,859
All you represent is anarchy. You made
a mess. I suggest you clean it up.

392
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,029
Either way, our relationship is concluded.

393
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,615
Wait. You can't.

394
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,578
You know your hand is on me?

395
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,541
Clean it up.

396
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,343
JESSICA: <i>To the man who took my daughter,</i>

397
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,721
<i>please,</i>

398
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,222
<i>I am begging you.</i>

399
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,057
That's heartbreaking.

400
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,225
<i>Please let my baby go.</i>

401
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,061
Hey.

402
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,106
Are you okay?

403
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,986
Just can't stand watching
Jessica go through that.

404
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,406
I feel like that's what my mom felt like
when Slade Wilson abducted me.

405
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,911
That's not what you asked, though. Um...

406
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,623
I'm fine.

407
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,708
Well, you could have fooled me.

408
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,714
What happened to you on Nanda Parbat?

409
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:33,842
Ollie didn't tell you?

410
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,135
It's Ollie.

411
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,263
I guess I really am his sister
since I didn't tell you either.

412
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,019
I just didn't want to relive it.

413
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,688
Relive what?

414
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:49,858
Ra's, he...

415
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,490
He killed me.

416
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,285
(STAMMERING) Or almost did.

417
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,495
Ollie said that it was pretty bad.

418
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,415
And then Ra's

419
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,294
offered to use something...

420
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,337
I don't know, to bring me back.

421
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,883
Something he calls a "Lazarus Pit."

422
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,969
Wait, so what's happening to you now is...

423
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,682
is a side-effect from this Pit?

424
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,810
And Malcolm tried to warn Ollie,
I guess, but he

425
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,729
didn't listen.

426
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,107
No, of course he didn't.

427
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,235
He would do anything to save his sister.

428
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,784
I swear, if there is even
a scratch on that girl, so help me...

429
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm afraid that is out of my control.

430
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,622
Yeah, well, so am I. I am out.
I am all the way out!

431
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,460
Well, I suppose you need a reminder
that Madison Danforth is not the only

432
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,545
vulnerable daughter in this city.

433
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,468
You stay the hell away from my daughter,
you son of a bitch!

434
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,179
Language.

435
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,266
What is this?

436
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,935
The location of the Danforth girl.

437
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,147
My sincere threat
against your daughter notwithstanding,

438
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,523
this abduction lacks taste.

439
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,028
The next time we meet, and make
no mistake, there will be a next time,

440
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,655
remember to mind your tone.

441
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,414
Any news?

442
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,541
Only the bad kind.

443
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,127
Hey, we're going catch this guy.

444
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,337
Yeah. And when we do,
there'll be another one waiting for us.

445
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,006
And another. And another.

446
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,967
It's like the most depressing game
of Whack-A-Mole ever.

447
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,969
Can't say we didn't know
what we were getting into.

448
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,889
Or back into.

449
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,058
When we decided to stay in Starling,

450
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,020
I mean, Star City,

451
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,063
I was excited.
I thought it meant a new beginning.

452
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,858
And now, we've only been back a week,
John,

453
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,735
still mad at you, Thea's gone Pit-crazy.

454
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,070
I've spent the last two days
putting people out of work.

455
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,072
If you think that we made a mistake,
we didn't.

456
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,242
Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy.

Ms. Smoak,

526
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,931
what's this we're hearing about
you halting the workforce reduction?

527
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,392
I thought we agreed...

528
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,019
You talked and I listened.
I wouldn't hardly call that an agreement.

529
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,439
With that said,
I did get around to firing a few people.

530
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,982
They've all been hired back, BTW.

531
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,317
And one of them reminded me that

532
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,444
Ray Palmer never would
have approved of this.

533

you asked to see me. Uh...

No. Actually, you have perfect timing.

Mr. Dennis about your project.

opportunity to review his active projects.

540
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,466
Turns out he is working
on something that is going to

541
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,802
revolutionize technology
and save this company.

542
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,055
Neither of which he can do with
a reduced workforce supporting him.

543
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,477
Intriguing. So what's this revolutionary
technology, Mr. Holt?

-Uh... It's...
-That is proprietary.

it will astonish the world.

Oh, we will.

549
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,547
You don't even have an idea for some
"world-astonishing" technology, do you?

550
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,799
Nope. But I'm betting that you do.

551
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,885
Pretty bold move, Ms. Smoak.

552

a little differently.

I guess I was wrong when I told you
not to worry about me.

556
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,325
Right or wrong, I'm still gonna worry.

557

It's right at the top of the
big brother job description.

about the Pit immediately.

we will get through it together.

00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:18,152
I thought Thea could use some time out of
town. A spa getaway to clear her head.

while we're away?

571
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,374

kill each other first.
