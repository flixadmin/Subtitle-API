1
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,440
Where in hell is
your so-called magician?

2
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,233
He will be here, Lancelot.

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,860
He swore it.

4
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:46,493
They're preparing
for a second wave.

5
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,087
Charge!

6
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:09,140
This...
This is what the end looks like.

7
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,916
Your so-called magician,
Merlin, cannot help us.

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,709
We're outnumbered, 100 to 1.

9
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,211
How are we gonna get out of this?

10
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:39,730
He promised a weapon,
one of great power.

11
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,047
Arthur, you are my king.

12
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:42,358
I will lay down my life for you,

13
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:45,051
but this Merlin is no wizard.

14
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,429
He's a worthless drunkard!

15
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:52,934
Oh, God, I'm sozzled!

16
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,978
One last nip.

17
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:11,369
<i>Magic does exist.</i>

18
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,205
<i>It was found, long ago,</i>

19
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,876
<i>inside a crashed alien ship.</i>

20
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,965
Hello?

21
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:26,384
Hello!

22
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,219
It is I,

23
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:33,308
conjurer of spirits,
master of the dark arts!

24
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:35,518
Is anyone there?

25
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,397
It is I, Merlin.

26
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,232
The wizard?

27
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,401
Remember me?

28
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:52,285
No! I kept your secret!
I did! Just as I promised!

29
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,371
I told no one of your existence. No one!

30
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,791
But you have to understand, we Britons

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,919
are in a desperate fight.

32
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,379
End-of-times sort of thing.
I mean it.

33
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,465
It's happening down
there now as we speak.

34
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,133
It's awful!

35
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,179
Big personalities just sort
of clashing and bloody.

36
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:16,351
I hate to ask... But we need your help.

37
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:18,686
There are no spells. There is no magic.

38
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:21,181
We retreat.
Live to fight another day.

39
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:21,648
No!

40
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:25,693
Without sacrifice...
There can be no victory.

41
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,320
This is madness!

42
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:28,821
He will be here.

43
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:31,157
All right, I am what they say!

44
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,994
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan.
I've deceived my whole life.

45
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,539
But if I could, for one moment,

46
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,499
change this world for the better,

47
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,834
I would give up everything. Everything!

48
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,837
I'd give up drink, money, wom...

49
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,673
Drink and money.

50
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,591
Look.

51
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,511
<i>Good men will die without your help.</i>

52
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,513
<i>Women. Children.</i>

53
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:57,642
I know your world
was destroyed. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,687
But please don't let ours die, too.

55
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,274
I beg of you.

56
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,771
Guardian Knights, transform.

57
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,732
Dragon is yours to command.

58
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,825
Oh. Yes.

59
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:16,452
That would be just the thing.

60
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,749
Protect this staff.

61
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,878
One day a great evil will come for it.

62
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,449
Oh, yes!

63
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,044
Charge!

64
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,775
<i>It has been said
through the ages,</i>

65
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,234
<i>without sacrifice,</i>

66
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,779
<i>there can be no victory.</i>

67
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,328
<i>There are mysteries
to the universe</i>

68
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,914
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

69
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:46,250
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

70
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:49,587
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

71
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,507
<i>Leave planet Earth alone.</i>

72
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,592
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

73
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,094
<i>for you.</i>

74
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,766
<i>These are troubled times.</i>

75
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:10,942
<i>Optimus Prime has left us
to find his makers.</i>

76
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,778
<i>Some say he will never return.</i>

77
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:17,782
<i>His sworn enemy, Megatron...
Vanished.</i>

78
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,993
<i>Without leaders, chaos reigns.</i>

79
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,995
<i>Two species at war.</i>

80
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,831
<i>One flesh, one metal.</i>

81
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,627
<i>Transformers are declared
illegal on Earth.</i>

82
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,839
<i>The world has set up
a new paramilitary force.</i>

83
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,966
<i>The TRF.</i>

84
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,259
<i>Except in Cuba,</i>

85
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,845
<i>Castro lets them sun on his beaches.</i>

86
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,055
<i>Hola, amigo!</i> Come on! <i>Vamonos!</i>

87
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,433
- No, he's busy.
- He's always busy.

88
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:48,229
A mojito needs ice.

89
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:49,897
Ice!

90
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,649
We are not animals.

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,528
<i>But these alien beings
keep arriving.</i>

92
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,988
<i>Endless waves of them.</i>

93
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,157
<i>Too many to count.</i>

94
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,827
<i>We look to the skies
with dread and we wonder.</i>

95
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,747
This is the jam! Ooh, I like this.

96
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:07,999
Good choice. Good choice.

97
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,710
Get it off my desk.

98
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,129
No way!

99
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,296
Where'd you get that?

100
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:15,923
<i>How much of
our time remains?</i>

101
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:21,179
<i>One hundred billion trillion
planets in the cosmos...</i>

102
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,432
No, get the Director on the phone.
Go, go, go!

103
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,268
<i>And they choose Earth.</i>

104
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:28,686
<i>Why?</i>

105
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:33,149
Y'all want to see some dead robots?

106
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:39,530
You crazy?
This is an alien No-Go Zone.

107
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,909
Government doesn't want us
to go in here.

108
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,025
We're not supposed to be here.

109
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,883
We're kids, man.
We get away with anything.

110
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,468
Nah, man.

111
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:02,720
I'm getting me a souvenir.

112
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,894
Whoa, this is the real deal.

113
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,854
There's a dead one over there.

114
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,081
- Cool!
- Not cool.

115
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:14,649
TRF shot 'em down.

116
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:18,069
Whatever. My dad says shoot 'em
all and let God sort 'em out.

117
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:20,905
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

118
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:23,241
- Bro, what is that?
- Dude.

119
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:24,534
It's a robot!

120
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:25,677
Dude, I think it's dead.

121
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,828
Nah, bro.

122
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,162
Yeah, it's totally dead.

123
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,681
He's definitely, definitely dead.

124
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:30,705
I know, right?

125
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,209
Wait, guys. I think it's moving.

126
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:49,433
<i>Warning!
Unauthorized trespassing.</i>

127
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,279
Shit.

128
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:51,954
<i>This is the Department

131
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,112
Hey!

00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,448
<i>Mira, puto!</i>

133
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:21,632
Sqweeks! Do it!

134
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:29,390
Follow me!

135
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:43,988
Come on, get up!

136
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,660
Hey, sir. This area is active.

137
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,495
We just had two Sentinels go down.

138
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:52,663
What have you got?

139
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:54,749
Never look back!

140
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,884
- It's coming!
- All right, go in there.

141
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:17,480
Damn. I almost had a heart attack!

142
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,315
Relax. We're covered.

143
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:21,442
Sqweeks!

144
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:22,777
What's that?

145
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,028
What the...

146
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,819
What happened to your arm?

147
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,449
Shot you?

148
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:29,825
Damn it!

149
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,787
He can't transform.

150
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:34,288
I'm trying to fix him.

151
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,374
But you're being
a baby about it, Sqweeks.

152
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,044
It's all right. You did good.

153
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:42,713
Wow. You have a big heart...

154
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,216
That seems to be working.

155
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,885
What's your workout routine?

156
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,525
Whoa!

157
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,819
It's all right. It's all right. I told you.

158
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,822
"Covered." It's Canopy.

159
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,119
Cyclops, zoom in on target.

160
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,580
<i>Unable PID.
Visual on five little feathers.</i>

161
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:18,082
Kids. Shit.

162
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:20,251
<i>Cannot confirm Decepticon.</i>

163
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:22,003
No badge. I got kids in danger.

164
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,272
- Canopy thing's pretty crazy.
- It's none of your business.

165
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:25,297
Stop flirting.

166
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:28,551
Request immediate air support.
Danger close. Do not fire.

167
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,263
- Who is he?
- Let's go.

168
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,056
Far as you're concerned, my boyfriend.

169
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,184
How long's that been going on?

170
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:42,178
You kids gotta get out of here.

171
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,941
"Kids"? You're here.

172
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,234
I live here.

173
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,861
This is my home.

174
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,613
What's this?
The living room or the dining room?

175
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,323
Someone's gotta take care of 'em.

176
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,908
I don't think so.

177
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,036
- They're scared. They're lost.
- Hurry.

178
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:57,639
<i>I've got a heat
signature. Hostile intent is displayed.</i>

179
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:58,706
Tango is armed.

180
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:00,934
<i>On location
30 seconds. Am I cleared to fire?</i>

181
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,294
No, place, no home, no family.
Do you know how that feels?

182
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:05,755
No, 'cause your asses got
big old houses to go home to.

183
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:07,757
- We got a condo.
- Shh!

184
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,675
I love her.

185
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,028
<i>Viper Flight.
We need a clearance.</i>

186
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,054
No badge, armed and hostile.
I got kids in danger.

187
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,281
<i>Hostile intent. Hostile intent.</i>

188
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,806
<i>- Alien has a weapon.</i>
- Fire!

189
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,615
He's down.
Bravo team, extract those kids.

190
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:33,741
We're moving out!

191
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,914
- Get up.
- I can't.

192
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,749
No, no, no, look at me.

193
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,835
Wake up, Canopy!
You're gonna be okay.

194
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,635
I want to thank you.

195
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:55,369
Wake up, look at me.
Wake up, Canopy.

196
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,764
I'm not leaving you.

197
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,224
You're all I have left!

198
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,852
No, no, no.

199
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,869
Hey! It's all I got in my bag of tricks,
so you might want to hop in.

200
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,665
Hey! Where are the keys?

201
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:23,958
Where are the keys?

202
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,485
I'm just gonna hotwire this bitch.

203
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:41,016
<i>- I'm tired of people messing with me.</i>
- It's over.

204
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:43,144
No! I can fix him.

205
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,645
Nobody can fix him, he's dead.

206
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,189
Hey, look at me.
Would he want you to die, too?

207
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,691
Let's go, now.

208
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:54,738
Come on, come on!

209
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,828
Come on. Come on, no time, let's go.

210
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:02,496
What? Hey, you're that guy.

211
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,706
No, I'm not that guy.

212
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:05,016
The one who saves Transformers.

213
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,184
I thought you were just a legend.

214
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,251
Some legend.

215
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,502
- You were too late!
- Go. Go.

216
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,355
Hey, you know there's a
reward for turning you in.

217
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,379
- Really?
- Yeah.

218
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,822
Cool. You want to get punched
in the face, like, really hard?

219
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,301
No.

220
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,136
- Good. Go.
- Okay.

221
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:18,387
You're such an idiot.

222
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,848
See ya around, "legend."

223
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:22,183
Sqweeks.

224
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,864
Oh!

225
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,283
Easy. Easy, all right?

226
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,368
I'm just here to help you.

227
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,917
Easy, buddy. Yeah.

228
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:52,254
You're hurt really bad.
All right?

229
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:58,636
Protect from Quin...

230
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:01,680
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:06,644
Take the...

232
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,814
The talisman will protect you.

233
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,274
Oh, you don't owe me anything.

234
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,568
<i>Seglass Ni Tonday.</i>

235
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,779
I can't. You keep it.

236
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,405
Quin... Quin...

237
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,746
He didn't make it, Bee.
I'm coming out solo.

238
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,833
This is turning
into one shitty-ass day.

239
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:04,928
<i>Cyclops, eyeball Kingfish.</i>

240
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,328
<i>Flip IR to EO.</i>

241
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:11,709
He's a positive match, sir.
It's Cade Yeager.

242
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,629
It's over.
Help yourself out here.

243
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,551
Where are the others?
The ones you're hiding.

244
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,012
I don't sell out friends.

245
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,471
"Friends."

246
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,056
This is an invasion.

247
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:29,226
One day we wake up...
They're in charge.

248
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:31,395
You see anybody in charge?

249
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,023
They just keep falling out of the sky.

250
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,125
Something's coming,

251
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,734
and you can't shoot
your way out of it.

252
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,054
What was that?

253
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:06,513
That was a mistake.

254
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,826
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

255
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:49,848
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:52,142
<i>Next time you shoot somebody,</i>

257
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,728
<i>don't go near 'em
till you're sure they're dead.</i>

258
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:56,647
Put the weapon down, trust me!

259
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:58,357
Easy, Bee. Easy.

260
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:03,320
<i>I'll burn you so bad
you'll wish you'd died as a child.</i>

261
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:04,487
Shoot him!

262
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:06,532
You're dead before I hit the ground.

263
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,700
- I said stand down.
- Shoot! Shoot!

264
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,954
Take the shot! Shoot!

265
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:13,664
Don't do it, Bee!

266
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,500
Hold your fire! Hold it!

267
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,168
You! Drop it!

268
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:20,587
I'm not dropping shit.

269
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,423
Hey.

270
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,266
The military doesn't
want it this way,

271
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,592
Bee, you gotta believe that.

272
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,988
It's a new world order now
and these guys are calling the shots.

273
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,848
All they want is a home, and you know it.

274
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:33,600
You push them,
and they push right back.

275
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,520
Hound's in town.

276
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,564
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

277
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,650
Sorry I'm late.
My invitation to this ass-kicking

278
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,735
must've got lost in the mail!

279
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,113
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

280
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,365
- Call off your birds.
- Let's go.

281
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,033
They're not gonna touch us.

282
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:51,881
All right, Star 1, abort.

283
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:53,328
Negative Decepticon activity.

284
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:56,415
TRF, stand fast. Drop your guns.

285
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,473
You sure you don't want to shoot?

286
00:19:58,503 --> 00:19:59,626
I'm a big ol' target.

287
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,503
Wusses.

288
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,672
Whose side are you on?

289
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,839
They're all bad.

290
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,925
No, they're not.

291
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,678
Eagle Eye, tag him.

292
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,351
I've never seen
one like it, General.

293
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:20,355
This one's older,
older than Optimus Prime.

294
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:23,901
Decepticon Barricade
was spotted at that same location.

295
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:31,533
CIA's had him under Pred
surveillance for a while now.

296
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:41,668
Yeah, he's been keeping
some interesting company.

297
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,564
<i>The staff is hidden on Earth.</i>

298
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,924
<i>A weapon of ultimate power.</i>

299
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,176
<i>We'll find this staff.</i>

300
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,677
That voice.

301
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,804
I can hear it in my nightmares.

302
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,532
- Megatron.
- Waiting for authentication.

303
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:55,557
It's him.

304
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,684
Lord Megatron.

305
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,437
Get that out of my face.

306
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,064
Report.

307
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:04,691
Tell me you have found the talisman.

308
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,778
I saw it.
A dying knight gave it to a human.

309
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,572
But there was too much TRF firepower.

310
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,200
You let the talisman get away!

311
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:16,912
We must have it!

312
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,123
Without the talisman,
we cannot find the staff!

313
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,334
I know who can lead us to it.

314
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,128
The TRF.

315
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,631
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

316
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,885
or "staff" as he calls it,
secured at all cost.

317
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:34,721
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

318
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:37,099
Sir... They just don't get it.

319
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:39,810
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

320
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:44,856
Oh, what we would all give
to have Prime back right now.

321
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,609
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

322
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:51,071
<i>Re-entry Cybertron.</i>

323
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,637
My world!

324
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:19,474
What has happened to my world?

325
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:22,102
Your world is dying.

326
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:27,190
I've been waiting for you, Optimus.

327
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,151
Come meet your maker.

328
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:33,030
You are my creator?

329
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,451
I am Quintessa, the Prime of Life.

330
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,581
What have you done to my home?

331
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,880
I will kill you!

332
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:54,551
You dare to strike your god?

333
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,723
Your war doomed Cybertron.

334
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:02,893
Megatron started the war!

335
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:07,397
You destroyed your world, you fool.

336
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,402
My perfect creation.

337
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,738
You're going to fix it,

338
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:18,617
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

339
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:23,246
I made you.

340
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,249
You are mine to command.

341
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:37,886
How did you get in here?

342
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,359
My lord, that weird thing

343
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,320
we've been waiting for
1,600 years to happen...

344
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,073
I think it's really happening this time!

345
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,583
The knight has arrived.

346
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,795
The talisman has been bestowed.

347
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,634
At last, Cogman. It begins.

348
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:40,657
Mine!

349
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:50,667
Yes!

350
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,797
Okay. Thanks.

351
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:57,382
Whew!

352
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:00,677
Wembly! I was quite open.

353
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:02,804
There's a reason
why you're always open.

354
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,491
There's a reason you're always single.

355
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,183
- What?
- What?

356
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:08,685
Idiot.

357
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:27,537
Oh, God. Okay.

358
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,831
So late, so late, so late.

359
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:37,172
484 CE. A desperate last stand
between civilization and barbarism.

360
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,716
Two worlds colliding.

361
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:41,635
Only one survives.

362
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,637
Lancelot. Percival.

363
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:44,971
King Arthur.

364
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,556
Honorable men.

365
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:49,476
Brave, muscles sinewed,

366
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,312
sweat glistening off their bodies.

367
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:56,233
A few brave men who were willing
to sacrifice all for victory.

368
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,652
Sound too good to be true, Poppy?

369
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,028
Because it's horseshit.

370
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:02,823
Arthur.

371
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:06,701
A likely composite of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

372
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,787
Our dragon.

373
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,164
Just a medieval catapult.

374
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,583
And then we have Merlin,

375
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,335
our Kingmaker.

376
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,587
Probably never existed.

377
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:19,756
The question is,

378
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:23,552
why? Why do we tell
ourselves these stories?

379
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:26,096
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

380
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,183
It's because we want to believe.

381
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:33,270
Believe that we can be
heroes in our own lives.

382
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:35,772
When all seems lost,

383
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,191
a few brave souls, us,

384
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:40,443
can save everything we've ever known.

385
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:43,668
Or is it just the dragons?

386
00:26:58,295 --> 00:26:59,462
Well,

387
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,716
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

388
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,552
Signs of the end are all around us.

389
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:08,680
You know what to do, don't you?

390
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:13,643
We must rebuild my home.

391
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:17,981
There is a way to heal your world.

392
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:21,651
My power of creation, the staff,

393
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:26,072
was stolen from me
by my 12 guardian knights.

394
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:30,285
They betrayed me and hid it on Earth.

395
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:33,204
<i>Gave it to your precious humans.</i>

396
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,668
The staff is the only way
to bring life back to Cybertron.

397
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:41,963
You are going to find it for me.

398
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:45,300
Do you seek redemption, Prime?

399
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:47,844
Do you?

400
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:49,638
My maker,

401
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,806
I do.

402
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:58,605
No fear. No hate. No anger.

403
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:04,444
No fear. No hate. No anger.

404
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:07,489
Get off, you maggot!

405
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,618
I will kill you, flying rat!

406
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:16,790
He's very little. Very tiring.

407
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:19,125
Losing our heads sitting around here.

408
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,211
So tired of hiding.

409
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:34,391
Oh, hey, Chief! Wow, nice... Ow.

410
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:35,684
God!

411
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,519
Nice horse you got there.

412
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,927
You're really getting into
this whole Indian thing, huh?

413
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:43,400
Don't call me Chief.
My name is Sherman.

414
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,044
Aren't you the tribal chief?

415
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,153
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

416
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:49,155
I don't know, vaguely racist.

417
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:52,409
- My cruiser got stolen.
- What?

418
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,744
- Again.
- That's terrible!

419
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:55,870
You know what?

420
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:57,223
Shit's getting out of control.

421
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,748
There's crime going on everywhere!

422
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:00,166
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

423
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,919
Cut the shit, Cade...
And get me my car back.

424
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:15,432
Is this an Autobot hookup site?

425
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:16,933
Nah, I just go here to dream.

426
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,102
Check out that classy chassis.

427
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:22,439
Whoa! Look at the junk in her trunk, eh?

428
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:25,483
Booyah! Big time.

429
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,528
I should not have eaten
all of that Tijuana street machinery.

430
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,864
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

431
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,115
Yo!

432
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,560
What's your problem, dude?

433
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:34,868
Sqweeks!

434
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,787
Next time, ease on the brakes!

435
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,166
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement when I arrive.

436
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:43,293
Well, you're getting dust
all over the campus!

437
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:44,919
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

438
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:47,130
Come on, hustle. <i>Andale, andale!</i>

439
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:50,717
Jimmy!

440
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:53,136
Hey, don't take
any aggression out on me.

441
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,805
Damn it, Grimlock! We're guests here!

442
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:58,308
You got in some shit, huh?

443
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,642
Yeah, neck deep!

444
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:03,438
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

445
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:06,232
You need a leader out there... Like me.

446
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,485
<i>Shut up. Before I do some damage</i>

447
00:30:08,568 --> 00:30:09,986
<i>you won't walk away from.</i>

448
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,821
You will never be Optimus Prime.

449
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:13,281
<i>You talk too much.</i>

450
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:14,967
Come on, man.
Million-year-old legendary warrior

451
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,035
and you act
like a bunch of junkyard dogs!

452
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:18,578
You're starting to piss me off!

453
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,834
<i>Ay, chihuahua!</i>

454
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,836
Come back here, Grimlock!

455
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:28,922
Turn around.
What do you got in your mouth?

456
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,135
I swear, I am wasting my time
protecting you.

457
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,720
Drop the cruiser right now!

458
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:38,264
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

459
00:30:38,348 --> 00:30:39,516
Drop it!

460
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:43,103
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

461
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:44,437
<i>Wow!</i>

462
00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:57,367
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

463
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:01,121
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

464
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:04,332
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade out here, Jimmy J.

465
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:08,169
You hired me from a want ad
in the <i>Dakota Penny Ledger.</i>

466
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:10,630
Think that comes with a superpower?

467
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:14,300
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

468
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,803
That was not in the ad!

469
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,429
It tried to eat me yesterday.

470
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:20,709
You want to go to federal prison?

471
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:22,642
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

472
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:23,869
Well, that's where
you're gonna go, okay?

473
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,253
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

474
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:26,351
I'm a fugitive, all right?

475
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:27,665
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

476
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:28,690
When you leave,

477
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:31,067
it becomes the <i>Wild Kingdom</i> out here.

478
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:32,402
I don't know what to do.

479
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,809
I told you, this is a junkyard.

480
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,502
They blend in with other junk. That's it.

481
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:38,324
You hired me to be senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

482
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:40,302
- Did I tell you that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

483
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,297
I made that shit up.

484
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,246
Do not take this title away
from me, Cade.

485
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:45,391
This is not a startup, okay?
I don't do this shit for money.

486
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:46,455
It's for the higher cause.

487
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,852
You don't do this shit
for the money?

488
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,502
What's wrong with you?
How you gonna eat?

489
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:51,171
What's he doing here?

490
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:55,925
Daytrader's here.

491
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:59,596
Ugh! Here comes the most irritating,
annoying Transformer on Earth.

492
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:01,574
What did he give you
to get past the gate?

493
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:04,684
- Nothing!
- Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

494
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:06,895
I've never seen that before in my life.

495
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:09,772
Come on, say it!
You wanted the alien blaster.

496
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:11,691
You said a big gun makes a big man.

497
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,878
Hey, you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

498
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:15,862
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey!
- Come here!

499
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,089
The worst senior vice president...

500
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:18,084
Stop it! Stop it!

501
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:20,450
Yeah, you're real tough!
What, you been working out?

502
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,869
- Should I frag him?
- Yes, definitely frag him.

503
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:24,204
I heard that, Hound.

504
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,288
Easy!

505
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,625
Oh, God. You always resort to violence
right off the bat.

506
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:29,791
I love violence.

507
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,128
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

508
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:33,546
You find our spaceship yet?

509
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,773
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

510
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:36,049
waiting to catch a bullet.

511
00:32:36,132 --> 00:32:38,968
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps
a small gasoline drinking problem

512
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,763
are gonna kill you long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

513
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:43,616
- Back off! Get out of my face.
- Watch it! Guys, stop!

514
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,658
You want to throw down with Hound?

515
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:46,267
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

516
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:48,811
How about you trying to carry
all this stuff?

517
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,319
Oh, that's where that's been.

518
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:57,445
Come on!

519
00:32:58,238 --> 00:32:59,405
Look what I found in Buffalo.

520
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,866
Starscream's head,
ladies and gentlemen.

521
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:03,910
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

522
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,161
Is it gonna work this time?

523
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:06,972
I only got the good stuff,
Cade. Come on.

524
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,582
You hear that, Bee?
You're gonna talk, buddy!

525
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:11,143
<i>Can't touch this!</i>

526
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,460
Get down, Bee!

527
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:13,836
<i>Too hype, can't touch this!</i>

528
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,588
All right, what else you got?

529
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:18,216
Where'd you get that piece of junk?

530
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:21,219
A Knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

531
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:24,138
Nah, it's not real. Is it?
No, definitely not.

532
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:25,491
Hey, give it to me,
I'll take it off you.

533
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,785
You think I don't know
what the hell this is? How valuable?

534
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,453
But I know it's something,
because it's got you

535
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:30,677
licking your chops, you skank.

536
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:32,355
Words hurt, Cade.

537
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:33,958
There are exactly seven... Count them.

538
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,692
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

539
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:38,361
And that talisman showing up here
is <i>numero uno.</i>

540
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,071
If that fancy pancake was real,

541
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:43,074
I'd grab the spaceship
and blow this dirtball planet.

542
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,576
All right, I'm gonna go
slather myself in oil.

543
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:47,954
Turn your back, Drift,
if it offends your sensibilities.

544
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:50,164
Now that is something you can't unsee.

545
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:51,976
I barely understand
what's coming out of your mouth.

546
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,001
Hey, mister!

547
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:54,585
Oh, this isn't happening.

548
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,380
You cannot stay here, kid.
I got enough strays.

549
00:33:57,547 --> 00:34:00,133
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

550
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,302
- Yeah, good for you.
- Better than anyone.

551
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:03,678
And I have a name, you know.

552
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:05,388
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

553
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,682
I don't care if it's a Z,
an emoji, or a dollar sign,

554
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,059
all right? This is no place for...
Just go home. Please.

555
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,520
I don't got a home.

556
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:15,231
And they...

557
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:17,650
They just killed

558
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:20,528
the last thing that I called family.

559
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,281
So no,

560
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,868
I'm not going anywhere.

561
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:31,873
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

562
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:34,375
You can't fight them,
and you can't beat them.

563
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:37,545
All right? They have the support
of the entire world.

564
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,130
You, you're a kid.

565
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:45,428
Why are you still following me?

566
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:50,183
T!

567
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:54,395
First flames, dude! Whoa!

568
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,481
Hey! Mister!
Your trailer's on fire.

569
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,608
Whoa. Hey, corner.

570
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:01,319
- Oh, my God.
- Buddy! Oh, I'm proud of you.

571
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,244
I know, but you gotta do it
outside now, okay?

572
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,156
You could burn this whole place down.

573
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,259
I know, but you're coming
into your power now, all right?

574
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:08,868
So you gotta blow the flames... Ah! No.

575
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:14,624
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

576
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:16,626
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

577
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:18,169
You're tearing everything apart.

578
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,634
Perfect delivery, buddy.
You gotta work on the pickup.

579
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,427
I still got him in training.

580
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:29,972
What happened to your family?

581
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:35,645
You first.

582
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:38,147
Oh, wife passed away.
Daughter's at college.

583
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,982
She might as well be on the moon.

584
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:41,776
At least she's still here, bro.

585
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,295
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

586
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,987
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

587
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,291
Your turn,
unless you're too tough to share.

588
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,576
Decepticon fired a rocket.

589
00:35:51,577 --> 00:35:53,454
Parents were home, I wasn't.

590
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:55,957
No way I was going to foster.

591
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,670
Hey, little guy.

592
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:02,755
You're heavy!

593
00:36:02,922 --> 00:36:05,341
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

594
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,426
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:12,682
Fine.

596
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,851
Fine.

597
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:18,020
I'll bounce in the morning.

598
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,499
Great. Look, if you're hungry,
I got some frozen pizza burritos.

599
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,608
There might be some Smucker's
in the fridge.

600
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,360
And tell everyone where you are.

601
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:26,446
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a 12-year-old?

602
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,531
Fourteen.

603
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,509
You know, you're really missing out.

604
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,213
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, Little J-Lo.

605
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:34,704
You think you're a bad-ass, huh?

606
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,682
All right, tough guy,
I got a pop quiz for you.

607
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:39,125
Say you got an inline Energon leak
on a Slant-6.

608
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,377
Don't get it fixed,
Autobot's about to bleed out.

609
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,461
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

610
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:46,132
All right. First of all,
Transformers don't have a Slant-6.

611
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:49,218
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in ancient history.

612
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,654
The late '60s are not ancient history.

613
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,239
Yeah, but if I was fixing an Energon leak,

614
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:55,308
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel
the central flow into the... The...

615
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:57,059
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

616
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,228
- The doohickey thing.
- Yeah.

617
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:00,438
Not bad.

618
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,231
Watch your mouth.

619
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,706
How long has this been here?

620
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:27,924
It's growing. Yeah.

621
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:29,592
Three meters a day.

622
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,563
Six horns.

623
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:46,609
Six horns, six locations.

624
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:49,457
And they're growing
at an exponential rate.

625
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:51,989
Alien... Whatever they are.

626
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,909
Chinese call them "Horns from Hell."

627
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,619
Oh, my God.

628
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:58,704
Cybertron is coming.

629
00:37:58,871 --> 00:37:59,956
What?

630
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,894
I'll have 17 minutes
to brief the President.

631
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:04,961
What do you got for me?

632
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:06,921
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass...

633
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:10,132
Look at this.
It's amazing this thing flies at all.

634
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,064
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

635
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,971
No. It's much worse than that.

636
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:18,975
It's a gravitational anomaly
caused by a planet-sized object

637
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:21,394
with a current velocity
of 1/10th light speed.

638
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:24,272
Hmm. That's some geek stuff.
Is it a threat?

639
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,023
If you just give me...

640
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,942
No, I got a lunch. No.

641
00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:30,778
No, it's not a threat.

642
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,531
A threat might kill you.

643
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:37,326
This will kill you in three days.

644
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:43,791
How much do you weigh?

645
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,627
Are you technically
considered overweight?

646
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,170
No. It's just all my gear.

647
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:51,507
It's like somebody packed
10 pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

648
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,175
No, he's a chunky Autobot.

649
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,510
Ow! You wanna stop that?

650
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:56,721
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

651
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:01,183
I'm bouncing a signal through
Portugal, Istanbul and Katmandu.

652
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:03,894
You got 20 seconds, chief.

653
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:07,857
- Whoops.
- Really?

654
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,859
Infestation of puppy transformers.

655
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:12,653
This here's a big boy zone.

656
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:14,363
<i>Hello?</i>

657
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:16,365
<i>Hello? Dad?</i>

658
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:20,411
<i>Look, I know...
I know you can't talk to me</i>

659
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:22,580
<i>or say anything back.</i>

660
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:24,915
<i>But you can listen.</i>

661
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:30,254
<i>I'm gonna say what I always say
until you hear me.</i>

662
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,507
<i>You don't need to save the world.</i>

663
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:36,385
<i>You need a frigging girlfriend.</i>

664
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:40,556
<i>Wherever you are,
I don't want you to die alone.</i>

665
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:44,560
<i>And I know you only
got five seconds left, so...</i>

666
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:47,730
<i>I'm fine, I'm safe.</i>

667
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:50,274
<i>And I love...</i>

668
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:57,573
Any longer,
they'd have snagged our location.

669
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:01,369
You're a hell of a father, Cade.
Don't forget it.

670
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,621
Hell, my dad never called me.

671
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,756
We call it the Tank.

672
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,758
He likes it down here.

673
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:18,386
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

674
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:23,766
Decepticons seem just as interested
in these structures as we are.

675
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,268
Pred snapped this in Siberia.

676
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:30,189
He's been seen at all six horn locations
around the world.

677
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:33,275
ID confirmed. Megatron.

678
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:37,446
<i>And get this.
He made contact with TRF.</i>

679
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:41,117
Snatched up two CIA case officers.
Said he wants to negotiate.

680
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,577
With him? What the hell does he want?

681
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:46,831
<i>Certain alien
associates of his released.</i>

682
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:50,126
<i>Scheduled contact is ID'd and cleared.</i>

683
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,962
<i>Confirmation. Hostages are clear.</i>

684
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:54,898
<i>The Department of Justice has okayed it</i>

685
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,675
so long as the US military
watches his every move.

686
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:01,178
You're gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

687
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,475
You know who they always kill first?

688
00:41:10,312 --> 00:41:11,981
Lawyers.

689
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:15,568
We've made deals with the devil
before during times of crisis.

690
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:17,361
<i>If we're gonna get through this,</i>

691
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:19,155
<i>we have got to open the door</i>

692
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,865
<i>and let the monsters inside.</i>

693
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,952
There is a weapon out there
of unimaginable power.

694
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,496
A threat to our very existence.

695
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:29,623
And Megatron can lead us to it.

696
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,836
Do I know you, human?

697
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,839
- I want my crew!
- Give me names!

698
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,009
- Mohawk.
- Mohawk?

699
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:45,347
What up, fellas? Man,
I want to kill you right now.

700
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:50,227
But I'ma kill you later.

701
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:52,272
Definitely gonna kill y'all mofos later.

702
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:55,524
- He's cleared!
- All right.

703
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,319
<i>Dreadbot.</i>

704
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,282
Dreadbot. In for bank robbery.

705
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:07,119
<i>Aggravated assault. Murder.</i>

706
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,871
Double murder. Triple murder.
Nine dead.

707
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,706
Didn't even take the money. No.

708
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:12,208
We're not letting him out, no.

709
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:16,712
What?

710
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,964
I mean, but we can be flexible.

711
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:20,567
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

712
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:21,592
Okay, okay.

713
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:23,219
Okay.

714
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,471
Nitro Zeus.

715
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:26,889
Baby, free at last!

716
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,433
Thank Megatron, I'm free at last!

717
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,771
Thank you. Gonna miss you, Tim.

718
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:36,232
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

719
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:38,484
I know where you live, Enrique.

720
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:40,986
Say hello to your wife for me.

721
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:44,240
But the government requests
that he does not leave the county.

722
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:46,575
- And we're serious about that.
- Okay.

723
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,327
Okay.

724
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:52,540
<i>And last but not least,
Berserker.</i>

725
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,125
I'll suck your brains!

726
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,088
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah. No.

727
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,674
No. No. There are limits. Pick again.

728
00:43:01,841 --> 00:43:02,967
<i>Onslaught.</i>

729
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:05,135
You need a bigger door!

730
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:08,430
Uh...

731
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:10,641
Let me run that
up the flag pole real quick.

732
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,142
I just got to call someone.

733
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:14,687
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

734
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:16,105
Go. Go.

735
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:18,899
What do you really want, Megatron?

736
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:21,694
What anyone wants, human.

737
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,445
To go home.

738
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:25,339
Yeah, that'd be all right with me, too.

739
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:28,117
<i>Megatron,
he's after something Yeager has.</i>

740
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:30,995
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

741
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:33,747
We're gonna let those Decepticons
do our dirty work.

742
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:36,917
On my go, they'll be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

743
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:39,628
You track Megatron every step.

744
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:41,422
Take the weapon.

745
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:43,966
And then I'm taking his ass out.

746
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:48,512
No fear. No hate. No anger.

747
00:43:58,355 --> 00:43:59,815
Hey, guys.

748
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:03,319
Rise and shine.
Top of the morning!

749
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,699
Broke our asses
bagging these Decepticons.

750
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:09,825
Now they let them out?

751
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,899
What's really going on, Lennox?

752
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,037
Classified.

753
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:15,039
Just run your team.

754
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:24,298
Today,

755
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,800
we hunt.

756
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:30,054
Another glorious, boring day.

757
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,494
<i>Air's gonna be on station.</i>

758
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:39,355
<i>We're gonna have all EOIR sensors
on these guys as they move.</i>

759
00:44:39,521 --> 00:44:42,066
<i>Flight, push tactical when airborne.</i>

760
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:44,169
<i>I want air ops
locking down this transport.</i>

761
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:46,195
Decepticons in sight 100%.

762
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:48,864
Decepticons have just been
given Yeager's location.

763
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:54,078
<i>Cyclops.</i>

764
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,996
<i>Decepticons approaching
junkyard target.</i>

765
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,834
You strapping
on a Decepticon arm?

766
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:03,879
<i>Perfecto.</i>

767
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,924
Well, he was an ugly little robot.

768
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:09,051
You look like a warrior, Sqweeks.

769
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:10,494
<i>Muy guapo</i>.

770
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,554
Here goes, Bee.

771
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,848
<i>Just do whatever you want.</i>

772
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:17,184
Hey, Z, come on over here
and work on a real bot.

773
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,936
<i>Doc, come in, Doc.</i>

774
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:24,733
Oh, that's it.

775
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:26,902
No, third one on your left.

776
00:45:27,444 --> 00:45:29,029
No. Wait. Your left. Right here.

777
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:31,865
I know what I'm doing. Don't rush me.

778
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:33,826
Hey, calm the temper, okay?

779
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,244
Think he likes this?

780
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:37,329
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

781
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,581
Do you like the dentist? No.

782
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,043
Hound said you can only listen to her.

783
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,380
Your daughter. You can't talk back.

784
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,298
He's got a big mouth.

785
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:51,176
Said if you do, they can voice match you

786
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,637
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

787
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:55,806
Well, that's the world we live in.

788
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,141
What would you say to her?

789
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:03,939
Brush your teeth, work hard.

790
00:46:04,732 --> 00:46:07,234
Stay away from any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

791
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:10,029
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

792
00:46:10,112 --> 00:46:11,822
And DJs? Real dickheads.

793
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:13,365
Come on.

794
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:17,786
We had a thing. All right?
A saying, back and forth.

795
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:20,153
She'd always ask me,
"Dad, what are you doing tomorrow?"

796
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,458
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

797
00:46:24,752 --> 00:46:27,046
Looks to me like you're running out
of tomorrows, Yeager.

798
00:46:28,505 --> 00:46:30,799
That's just what she'd say.

799
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,094
Okay, Bee.

800
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:35,471
Done.

801
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,391
Come on, buddy, sit up.
Let's hear it.

802
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:40,809
Come on.

803
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:44,438
Your real voice.
For the first time, buddy. Belt it out.

804
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:46,065
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

805
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:48,776
<i>Oh, no. This isn't my damn voice.</i>

806
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,277
I'm gonna kill him, Bee.

807
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,612
<i>This is such bullshit.</i>

808
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:52,964
Okay, you know what? I'm not giving up.

809
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:54,591
All right? You're gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

810
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:57,034
<i>Daytrader is a punk-ass bitch.</i>

811
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,878
Cade. Uh, that thingy... Uh, that code.

812
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,089
<i>It's a red thingy.
There's somebody coming.</i>

813
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:12,174
Shit!

814
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:19,181
<i>Reaper has eyes on junkyard.</i>

815
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:21,809
<i>We have PID on Kingfish.</i>

816
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:26,688
Halt! This is protected land!

817
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:30,734
Sixty seconds to evac! Let's move!

818
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,091
<i>Cyclops,
it appears Kingfish is on the move.</i>

819
00:47:36,115 --> 00:47:37,282
They know.

820
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:39,284
We're blown, guys!
We gotta roll out now!

821
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:40,339
Hey, those are the Feds.

822
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:42,621
I know the government
when I see the government.

823
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:44,873
Grab as many weapons as you can.

824
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,167
I'm not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

825
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,054
Hey! This is the real world.
Okay? Let's go!

826
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:52,011
I can't go to jail. I'm too skinny for jail.
I can't even lift weights.

827
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:57,803
Bee, let's move!

828
00:47:57,886 --> 00:47:59,531
Give me this one.
You definitely gimme this one.

829
00:47:59,555 --> 00:48:01,157
This will mess somebody up good.

830
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,201
Roll out of here, Cade.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

831
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,025
Don't be a hero, Hound.
We're out of here now!

832
00:48:05,102 --> 00:48:07,146
- Wait! Wait!
- Hell, I was born a hero.

833
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:08,230
You're not leaving me!

834
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:09,982
You leave me, they take Sqweeks.

835
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:11,900
Leave Sqweeks! He's a survivor.

836
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,538
Megatron,
they got up out of here.

837
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:27,207
I kicked more ass in prison.

838
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,587
The end is near,
my old treacherous friend.

839
00:48:31,753 --> 00:48:32,856
Oh, she's coming!

840
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,758
What a shame you'll be unable to see it.

841
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:43,056
Come and get some,
you little bitch!

842
00:48:57,613 --> 00:48:58,756
<i>Coming your way, Lennox.</i>

843
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,592
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

844
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:02,201
Yeah, we'll see.

845
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,706
Tactical positions, let's go!

846
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,458
You, too, knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

847
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:19,301
Decepticons are coming.

848
00:49:19,384 --> 00:49:22,638
All right. We all know our hiding places.

849
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,182
What's this?
The tracker brought them right to us.

850
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,309
- When are you going to grow up?
<i>- Dang it.</i>

851
00:49:28,602 --> 00:49:30,020
<i>Target is four klicks away.</i>

852
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,022
<i>They just entered an abandoned town.</i>

853
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:54,169
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

854
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:07,391
Hey!

855
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:09,726
Yeager's got vital intel. Detain only.

856
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,604
TRF operation. Stay out of my way.

857
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:14,815
Those were my men.

858
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,859
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

859
00:50:17,943 --> 00:50:19,569
I'd like to at least keep my blaster.

860
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,363
Not today. We're sticking to the plan.

861
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:23,156
The whole town is wired and rigged.

862
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,742
You! Sit down. Now. Stay put.

863
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:45,137
Just a heads up.
We're probably going to jail,

864
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,556
so try getting used to that.

865
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,893
Here they come.

866
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:57,399
Autobots, get ready.

867
00:50:57,566 --> 00:50:59,568
Hey, Cade, you mind if I bail?

868
00:50:59,735 --> 00:51:01,194
<i>Don't attack until I say.</i>

869
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:04,990
Aw, yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

870
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,576
- Oh, I feel a fight coming.
- I'ma kill y'all right now.

871
00:51:07,784 --> 00:51:09,244
Search this town.

872
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,830
He's here.

873
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:14,458
I'm letting y'all know
what we came to do.

874
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:19,421
Get over here!

875
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:23,425
Look at that little
blue beetle-looking mofo.

876
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:26,988
Look at this little ugly dude.

877
00:51:27,012 --> 00:51:31,475
You are awash in their repulsive scent.
Disgusting.

878
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,227
- Hey!
<i>- Bee, stop her.</i>

879
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:36,355
Put him down!

880
00:51:36,521 --> 00:51:37,564
No. No, no, no, no.

881
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:40,192
Here she go. Look at her,
walking all strong with pigtails.

882
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,610
Go to hell!

883
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:43,487
This planet is hell.

884
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:46,073
Ooh, what's that on your arm?

885
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:48,533
- Put him down!
- Shit!

886
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,285
You think I'm afraid of you, <i>cabron?</i>

887
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,371
- Hey, stop!
- Cade Yeager.

888
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:54,498
I need that talisman!

889
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:04,633
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

890
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,736
You wanna go out there
and start screaming at a Decepticon?

891
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,053
Get those vile beings.

892
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:09,846
I'm on 'em!

893
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:26,196
Freeze!

894
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:35,997
I got the leg!

895
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:37,624
Gotcha!

896
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,544
And his fat head.

897
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:42,254
Don't get any better than that.

898
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:43,713
Drift, now!

899
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:46,716
Decepticons, retreat!

900
00:52:46,842 --> 00:52:47,843
Chickens!

901
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:51,847
That plan went to shit.

902
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:56,935
That's the only plan you got?

903
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:59,020
Get down, get down, get down!

904
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:04,568
- What are those?
- TRF.

905
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:07,737
- Whoa.
- We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

906
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:09,501
This is supposed
to hunt terrorists,

907
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:11,032
not tax-paying Americans!

908
00:53:11,116 --> 00:53:12,451
Not that I pay taxes, but...

909
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,537
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

910
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,373
Stop playing. Come on.
Am I the only one in here?

911
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,461
Ow!

912
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,880
Oh, this ain't right.

913
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:32,804
We're safe in here.

914
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:34,407
There's always one in charge.

915
00:53:34,431 --> 00:53:36,349
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

916
00:53:54,284 --> 00:53:56,077
Go, go, go!

917
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:58,079
Run!

918
00:53:58,246 --> 00:53:59,289
Move, move, move!

919
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Hide in that room!

920
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:09,404
Come on, come on, come on!

921
00:54:13,803 --> 00:54:15,156
I left the 'hood to not get shot

922
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,515
and now I'm getting shot.

923
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:18,517
This is the worst job ever.

924
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:20,083
Does this job even have healthcare?

925
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:21,436
It doesn't, do it?

926
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:23,323
You try treating a bullet wound
by yourself.

927
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,357
Watch out!

928
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,569
Run! Run!

929
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:39,996
Hide! Hide!

930
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:54,262
<i>Facial mapping engaged.</i>

931
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:55,470
You're a dead man.

932
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:12,320
Oh, shit. There's another one.

933
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:16,700
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

934
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:18,243
It's using facial recognition.

935
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:21,214
Are you crazy?

936
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:22,914
- Stay behind me.
- What?

937
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:24,725
- Jimmy J, don't!
- I got this. Get behind me.

938
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:25,959
- Don't do it.
- Get behind me.

939
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:27,042
It's a bad idea!

940
00:55:27,085 --> 00:55:28,085
Oh!

941
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,713
Shit.

942
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,850
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

943
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:41,516
Cade, I just want to tell you,
I love you, man.

944
00:55:42,058 --> 00:55:43,059
What?

945
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:45,162
This job wasn't what I thought,
but I appreciate everything.

946
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:47,188
- What are you doing?
- I'm dying!

947
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:49,190
It was only a beanbag, dude.

948
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:52,027
There's no hole?

949
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:53,671
There's no hole,
there's no blood, no nothing.

950
00:55:53,695 --> 00:55:55,155
- There's no hole.
- Will you get up?

951
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,507
Stop trying to act like a hero.

952
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:59,117
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

953
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,201
I felt it go through me!

954
00:56:00,785 --> 00:56:02,537
Come on, that
building right there!

955
00:56:08,627 --> 00:56:09,812
There's always one in charge!

956
00:56:09,836 --> 00:56:12,436
All right, we take out the big one,
we're gonna take them all out.

957
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:18,136
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

958
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,017
- Oh, my God! A leprechaun.
- Who the hell are you?

959
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:26,811
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

960
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:28,313
and that is offensive.

961
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:30,273
What are you looking at, little girl?

962
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,359
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

963
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:35,487
Hello. Master Cade,
I have been sent to collect you.

964
00:56:35,654 --> 00:56:36,881
- Collect me?
- That is correct.

965
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,239
Oh, you're not collecting shit.

966
00:56:42,577 --> 00:56:44,996
- Whoa, man! Slow down!
- So, you want to play rough.

967
00:56:50,335 --> 00:56:51,655
- Oh! Oh!
- No! No! Cade!

968
00:56:52,295 --> 00:56:53,421
Oh, shit!

969
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:55,465
- Cade! Cade!
- Hold on!

970
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:01,915
Did you see that? Hang on!

971
00:57:02,222 --> 00:57:03,723
Oh, I am so clumsy!

972
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:05,684
- Is he still alive?
- Hold on!

973
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,268
Is he still living?

974
00:57:07,477 --> 00:57:09,270
No, he's going to die!

975
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:15,151
My lord, this is not my fault,

976
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:16,778
but he just burst out of the elevator.

977
00:57:17,278 --> 00:57:18,279
<i>Ten stories.</i>

978
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:19,364
Oh, my God.

979
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:20,758
<i>Did you have a backup plan, sir?</i>

980
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:23,118
- Did he live?
<i>- I don't know! He just flew!</i>

981
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:37,382
My lord, rip an arm off a human

982
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:38,776
and they'll go wherever you want.

983
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,944
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

984
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,284
Whoa!

985
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:17,922
Eh, you little gnats.

986
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,342
Oh, there you are. Good to find you alive!

987
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:23,052
Just like nothing happened.

988
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:25,680
- Let's make you presentable.
- Hey! Come on!

989
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:27,515
Shiny, spic and span.

990
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:28,850
- Back off, Jeeves!
- There.

991
00:58:29,017 --> 00:58:30,935
- You look better already, sir.
- Who are you?

992
00:58:31,102 --> 00:58:34,105
My name is Cogman, sir.
And I am here because of that.

993
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:36,691
And that is here because of you.

994
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:40,570
It will not leave you
until your quest is fulfilled.

995
00:58:41,946 --> 00:58:44,032
You have been chosen.

996
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:46,743
What do you mean, "chosen"?

997
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:49,078
I will explain everything
if you'll kindly come with me.

998
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:51,623
Eh, Cade, what's with this C-3PO rip-off?

999
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:52,957
Don't kill the messenger

1000
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,043
or the messenger will kill you.

1001
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:58,630
Ouch!

1002
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:01,883
Now then, I'm afraid all this ballyhoo
is on your account.

1003
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,345
If you want to save your friends,
you will leave them.

1004
00:59:05,512 --> 00:59:06,697
Hey, don't talk
to that leprechaun!

1005
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:08,561
What, and run off
with some crazy ninja butler?

1006
00:59:08,723 --> 00:59:10,725
Your friends will be safe
in your absence.

1007
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:13,228
In your presence, unsafe.

1008
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:17,232
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

1009
00:59:17,732 --> 00:59:19,734
You are needed, sir.

1010
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:21,069
Urgently.

1011
00:59:21,736 --> 00:59:23,530
My master is fond of saying

1012
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:25,323
that all the important decisions in life

1013
00:59:25,406 --> 00:59:29,744
often come down to just one moment.

1014
00:59:38,586 --> 00:59:41,005
You're gonna be all right.
You're family now.

1015
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:43,258
They're gonna take care of you,
I promise.

1016
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:45,885
The plane is waiting.
We are going to England.

1017
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,095
Bee?

1018
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:51,891
Listen up, Little Miss Sunshine,
I'm in charge now.

1019
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,478
Just don't expect any bedtime stories.

1020
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:04,421
<i>Welcome to Air Folgan.</i>

1021
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:06,489
<i>Please strap in. Turbulence can kill.</i>

1022
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:08,456
<i>There will be no snack service
on this flight,</i>

1023
01:00:08,491 --> 01:00:10,118
<i>no drinks, no fun.</i>

1024
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:12,954
Tracking Yeager.
He's over the pond right now.

1025
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:15,331
It took some finding, but sats have him.

1026
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:17,258
Megatron and crew
are bearing down on the UK.

1027
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,711
So is Yeager. It's no coincidence.

1028
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:24,132
I want you airborne with your team
to the UK ASAP.

1029
01:00:27,802 --> 01:00:29,721
Pick up. Pick up.

1030
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:31,806
Yeah?

1031
01:00:31,973 --> 01:00:33,284
- Don't hang up!
<i>- Ah, it's you again.</i>

1032
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:35,810
<i>I've told you, you have nothing to offer.
Get lost.</i>

1033
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:38,438
I need a favor, Folgers.
I'd do it myself, but I can't.

1034
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:39,665
You ever fly a Cuban airplane?

1035
01:00:39,689 --> 01:00:41,733
They're from the 1940s.
So are the pilots.

1036
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,443
<i>Book of Cyber-Kells.</i>

1037
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,029
- I found it.
<i>- The ancient book? Impossible.</i>

1038
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:48,406
Not when you know the right janitor.
And I know many.

1039
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:50,825
The book exists. Unseen for centuries.

1040
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:53,578
Pages that literally dissolve
at room temperature,

1041
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:57,081
made from some old
kind of goat scrotum or something.

1042
01:00:57,165 --> 01:00:59,792
Trinity Library. Today, 4:00 p.m.

1043
01:00:59,876 --> 01:01:01,961
Be there if you want to know
how it all ends.

1044
01:01:08,176 --> 01:01:12,180
<i>Object confirmed
as exoplanet Cybertron.</i>

1045
01:01:13,097 --> 01:01:16,059
<i>Two days, seven hours to impact.</i>

1046
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:24,150
<i>Optimus,
it is time you knew the truth.</i>

1047
01:01:24,692 --> 01:01:26,235
<i>The place you call Earth</i>

1048
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:30,365
has another name. Unicron.

1049
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:34,202
Earth... Unicron?

1050
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:38,039
Cybertron's ancient enemy.

1051
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:39,874
Yes.

1052
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,168
You are going to kill him.

1053
01:01:42,752 --> 01:01:46,839
With my staff,
we will drain the very life from Unicron.

1054
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:50,510
- Earth will die...
- Yes.

1055
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:53,388
And your world will be reborn,

1056
01:01:53,554 --> 01:01:55,932
Nemesis Prime.

1057
01:01:57,266 --> 01:02:02,021
I will fight anyone
who stands in my way.

1058
01:02:03,982 --> 01:02:05,626
<i>The alien horns are still growing,</i>

1059
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:08,152
<i>some of them reaching 400 meters.</i>

1060
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:10,863
More alien rubbish.

1061
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,032
Have you found a man yet, Viviane?

1062
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,909
- No.
- So sad.

1063
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:16,316
You should really look in here.

1064
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:19,247
I mean, there are lots of adverts,
some of them very tempting.

1065
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:21,916
This one's looking for a BBW.
I don't know what that is.

1066
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,418
- It's a car, dear.
- Right.

1067
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:24,752
Big Beautiful Woman.

1068
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,546
Is it? Who knew?

1069
01:02:26,713 --> 01:02:28,381
Looking at the classifieds!

1070
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,591
Oh, this one's got its own dungeon.

1071
01:02:30,758 --> 01:02:32,927
Great! I love dungeons!

1072
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:34,887
See, that's perfect for you, isn't it?

1073
01:02:34,971 --> 01:02:36,764
All that old stuff, you'd love that.

1074
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:39,291
History is being rewritten
and you want to talk about a man.

1075
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,601
Or a woman.

1076
01:02:40,768 --> 01:02:42,103
Aunt Helen.

1077
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:43,688
"Women Seeking Women." Here we go.

1078
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:47,025
You could ask me about my work.

1079
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:48,526
Why would we do that?

1080
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:51,029
I mean, it's just dusty old books.

1081
01:02:51,195 --> 01:02:52,697
Now I welcome the end of days!

1082
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,216
What's so terrible about me wanting you

1083
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,034
to have what I had with your father?

1084
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,410
He was an ass.

1085
01:02:57,577 --> 01:02:59,096
Do you know
what Father didn't have?

1086
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,265
The one thing that his beloved
Knights of the Round Table

1087
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,291
had in spades
and he was utterly lacking?

1088
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,168
Honor.

1089
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:06,794
You can say that again.

1090
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:09,756
If you can stop loathing
a dead man long enough,

1091
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,358
you might want to have a look
in his study.

1092
01:03:11,382 --> 01:03:12,467
All that rubbish.

1093
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,273
<i>There might be something
you want to keep.</i>

1094
01:03:38,993 --> 01:03:40,703
Do not touch that!

1095
01:03:41,662 --> 01:03:43,247
Sorry, Daddy.

1096
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:46,834
I don't want anything.

1097
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:48,753
Tell the university to take the lot.

Back! Be quiet!
Do not hit me again!

1109
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,314
So, which bloody bot are you, then?

1110
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:52,316
Soundwave? Shockwave?

1111
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,570
At least tell me that I've been abducted
by one of the famous ones.

I am so much better
than all of them!

Oh! Help! I'm being kidnapped!

1119
01:05:16,424 --> 01:05:18,551
Wow!

01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,960
Wow, I love this car!

1121
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:38,779
Ah, the White Cliffs of Dover.

1122
01:05:50,124 --> 01:05:52,418
That's a good girl. Good girl.

1123
01:05:57,465 --> 01:06:00,468
Good girl. Come on. There's a good girl.

1124

01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:25,159
Idiot!

1128
01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:27,662
Hello there!

1129
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:29,997
<i>What the hell?</i>

1130
01:06:31,082 --> 01:06:32,083
Good girl.

1131
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,185
Master,
he's a complete knucklehead.

1132
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:35,836
I'm awfully sorry about that,
but, um, you see,

1133
01:06:36,212 --> 01:06:40,466
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914.
Something like that.

1134
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:41,633
So sad.

1135
01:06:41,676 --> 01:06:43,261
World War I and all that stuff.

1136
01:06:44,053 --> 01:06:45,989
I mean... Battle of the Marne,
Battle of the Somme,

1137
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:47,658
Battle of the Marne,
Battle of Passchendaele.

1138
01:06:47,682 --> 01:06:50,101
Trenches and mud and death

1139
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:51,978
and gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1140
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:54,522
"It's a long way to Tipperary,
it's a long way to go."

1141
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:57,066
Yeah, but it's, um... It's terrible!

1142
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:59,902
I mean, so sad, you know?
But then, I mean...

1143
01:07:00,111 --> 01:07:02,697
Isn't it? I mean,
this late onset of, um, well...

1144
01:07:03,698 --> 01:07:05,324
Robot dementia.

1145
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:07,034
It's not at all pretty.

1146
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:11,038
Ah, I don't know what you're smoking
in that pipe, man, but...

1147
01:07:11,247 --> 01:07:12,999
What's going on here?

1148
01:07:13,082 --> 01:07:14,083
Did you drag me to some.

1149
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,352
- Transformer retirement home?
- Mmm-hmm.

1150
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:17,354
Look, somebody better start talking,
or I'm outta here.

1151
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:18,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

1152
01:07:19,046 --> 01:07:20,047
Um, Bumblebee?

1153
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:22,401
We only met when
I was a little boy in short pants.

1154
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:23,676
I must have been that tall.

1155
01:07:23,843 --> 01:07:26,387
Maybe taller.
Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1156
01:07:26,554 --> 01:07:27,554
But never forget a face.

1157
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:28,889
Bee, you know this guy?

1158
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:31,100
- <i>I don't... with you.</i>
- Oh, yes.

1159
01:07:31,183 --> 01:07:32,768
Let's have a look at this thing.

1160
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:34,395
Please. Very interesting.

1161
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:36,605
Yes.

1162
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:41,068
You keep a secret for so long,
knowing it to be true,

1163
01:07:41,235 --> 01:07:42,987
and yet, deep down inside,

1164
01:07:43,529 --> 01:07:45,406
you begin to wonder,

1165
01:07:46,073 --> 01:07:48,200
"Has my life been wasted?"

1166
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:51,078
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1167
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,623
It's just Cade.

1168
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:57,551
Look, old timer, I don't have
a ton of patience for riddles right now.

1169
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:00,796
Yes, but you want to know,
don't you, "dude,"

1170
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,257
why they keep coming here.

1171
01:08:04,008 --> 01:08:06,719
To Earth. Right?

1172
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,475
Ah! I do so love perfect timing.

1173
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,563
What a bitchin' car she is!

1174
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,591
No, no, no, little lady.

1175
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:30,076
Why do you have to
be like that? <i>Pourquoi?</i>

1176
01:08:31,952 --> 01:08:33,746
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1177
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:35,956
or her first Transformer experience?

1178
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:37,124
It's both, really.

1179
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:39,126
Do not hit me again!

1180
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:42,880
But she does have a rather nice
fight-or-flight response.

1181
01:08:43,631 --> 01:08:46,133
She's very difficult.

1182
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:50,304
<i>My name is Edmond Burton,
12th Earl of Folgan.</i>

1183
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:53,516
Last surviving member
of the Order of the Witwiccans.

1184
01:08:53,766 --> 01:08:55,267
Wow.

1185
01:08:55,768 --> 01:08:56,769
What's up?

1186
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:05,528
Does he have to loom like that?

1187
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:11,033
"Ut" what?

1188
01:09:12,493 --> 01:09:13,493
"Ut rut"?

1189
01:09:14,703 --> 01:09:16,539
- Hot Rod.
- Mmm-hmm.

1190
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:17,665
It's his French accent.

1191
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,041
Is he French?

1192
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,793
No, he just likes the accent.

1193
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,255
No, no, no! I hate the accent!
But I can't get rid of it.

1194
01:09:24,338 --> 01:09:26,257
I'm stuck with the accent. Ugh.

1195
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,675
He's a soldier, Miss Viviane.

1196
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:30,719
He swore an oath to your father
to protect you.

1197
01:09:30,803 --> 01:09:33,013
- Huh.
- Some dad you got there.

1198
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:34,991
That is a nice ride.
I mean, you can roll right up

1199
01:09:35,015 --> 01:09:36,159
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

1200
01:09:36,183 --> 01:09:38,644
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

1201
01:09:40,312 --> 01:09:41,355
What am I doing here?

1202
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:43,774
- Yeah, why is she here?
- Introductions.

1203
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:46,670
Miss Viviane Wembly.
Master of History, Oxford.

1204
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:48,362
Doctor of Philosophy, also Oxford.

1205
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:51,282
And Doctor of Letters,
again Oxford, I think. Anything else?

1206
01:09:51,365 --> 01:09:52,908
Anyway, meet Cade.

1207
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:54,702
Yeager.

1208
01:09:55,369 --> 01:09:57,163
Cade Yeager. I'm an inventor.

1209
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:58,706
Oh, you're an inventor.

1210
01:09:58,873 --> 01:10:00,541
- Yes, I am.
- What have you invented?

1211
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,626
- A lot of things.
- Like?

1212
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:05,212
Like a lot of things. Like...

1213
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:07,214
- Things that you've heard of.
- Like?

1214
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:08,692
Well, things that you will
have heard of, okay?

1215
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:09,842
Patents are pending.

1216
01:10:11,343 --> 01:10:12,386
Ah.

1217
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:14,054
"Ah"?

1218
01:10:14,472 --> 01:10:16,056
Don't say that. What's "ah"?

1219
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:17,701
You know, I could do that, too.
"Oh, I'm English,

1220
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:19,005
"and I'm too cool for feelings."

1221
01:10:19,059 --> 01:10:20,561
What, I've come here to be insulted

1222
01:10:20,728 --> 01:10:23,522
by some over-educated
ivory-tower princess in a stripper dress?

1223
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:24,940
Stripper?

1224
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:27,818
Well, only in America
is a finer education an insult.

1225
01:10:27,985 --> 01:10:29,745
And if my dress
makes you feel uncomfortable,

1226
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,322
then maybe I could take it off.

1227
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:33,073
Okay.

1228
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:35,242
That's enough!

1229
01:10:36,035 --> 01:10:38,078
- What's your problem?
- No, no, no!

1230
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:39,788
Cogman?

1231
01:10:40,706 --> 01:10:42,333
Shall I take his head off, madam?

1232
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:45,711
Tempting, but, um,
I can defend my own honor.

1233
01:10:45,878 --> 01:10:49,256
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

1234
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:53,010
Control, Cogman.
You must learn to control that impulse.

1235
01:10:53,093 --> 01:10:55,137
Channel it into other things.

1236
01:10:56,096 --> 01:10:57,431
Yes, my lord.

1237
01:10:57,765 --> 01:11:01,227
Like making beds or cooking food.

1238
01:11:01,769 --> 01:11:06,106
Polishing the silver. I am trying, my lord.

1239
01:11:06,273 --> 01:11:09,068
He is a "Headmaster."
A very rare breed.

1240
01:11:09,401 --> 01:11:11,028
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

1241
01:11:11,111 --> 01:11:13,447
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

1242
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:14,782
Good.

1243
01:11:15,533 --> 01:11:19,370
Cogman? Glass 17C is missing.
Did you break it?

1244
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:21,956
I've been a butler for
the aristocracy for 700 years.

1245
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:24,375
You are the worst I've ever worked for!

1246
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,186
Ah, these were
all my predecessors.

1247
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,754
They're all Folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

1248
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,548
My great-great-great-great aunt.

1249
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:32,442
She poisoned my
great-great-great uncle for some reason.

1250
01:11:32,466 --> 01:11:34,343
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

1251
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:36,637
There's my grandfather
over there, Aloysius.

1252
01:11:36,804 --> 01:11:38,430
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

1253
01:11:38,597 --> 01:11:40,975
He drunk sewage water,
committed suicide. He was quite mad.

1254
01:11:41,141 --> 01:11:42,893
They were all mad, really.

1255
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,353
There's bullet holes.

1256
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:48,315
Uh-uh. No, no. Nasty critter.

1257
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:50,150
No, no, no, no, no.

1258
01:11:50,776 --> 01:11:53,445
That's the watch that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

1259
01:11:54,488 --> 01:11:57,241
These are all the Witwiccans.

1260
01:11:57,449 --> 01:11:59,368
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

1261
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:02,663
Brilliant minds, explorers, scientists,
artists, world leaders.

1262
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,123
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1263
01:12:04,206 --> 01:12:06,366
People like Catherine the Great,
Empress of all Russia,

1264
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,894
General Washington,
William Shakespeare,

1265
01:12:07,918 --> 01:12:08,806
Queen Elizabeth of England,

1266
01:12:08,836 --> 01:12:09,980
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass,

1267
01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:11,444
Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers,

1268
01:12:11,589 --> 01:12:13,441
Giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin,
Churchill, Einstein,

1269
01:12:13,465 --> 01:12:15,801
Stephen Hawking, Henry V,
Leonardo da Vinci,

1270
01:12:15,968 --> 01:12:17,848
Newton, de Lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, Mahler,

1271
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:20,472
Edmund Hillary, Teddy Roosevelt,
Copernicus,

1272
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:22,474
Tesla, Galileo.

1273
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:24,768
They all belonged to a secret society,
you see.

1274
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:26,186
All united in one cause.

1275
01:12:26,353 --> 01:12:29,356
To protect the secret history
of Transformers.

1276
01:12:30,107 --> 01:12:32,359
Here. On Earth.

1277
01:12:33,193 --> 01:12:35,404
Now, this is the Witwiccan family tree.

1278
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:38,157
Merlin, Viviana.

1279
01:12:38,324 --> 01:12:40,326
Goes back 40 generations.

1280
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:42,953
Go over to that desk.
There's a photograph there.

1281
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:45,039
Your father was a member.

1282
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:48,042
He very much wanted to tell you that.

1283
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:52,254
And my own family had some...

1284
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:56,925
Small part in all this.

1285
01:12:58,052 --> 01:12:59,470
ZB-7.

1286
01:12:59,595 --> 01:13:00,929
That looks just like Bee.

1287
01:13:01,013 --> 01:13:03,557
It is. He was attached
to the Devil's Brigade.

1288
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:05,726
Pretty vicious military unit.

1289
01:13:05,934 --> 01:13:07,895
<i>Helped turn the tide of war, you know?</i>

1290
01:13:19,156 --> 01:13:20,491
We're not invited.

1291
01:13:49,103 --> 01:13:50,229
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1292
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:51,313
But he's so nice.

1293
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,815
Behind the lines, during the war,

1294
01:13:52,898 --> 01:13:54,608
they called him many things.

1295
01:13:54,692 --> 01:13:56,735
"Nice" was never one of them.

1296
01:13:57,277 --> 01:13:59,405
It all began in 484 AD,

1297
01:13:59,488 --> 01:14:02,408
when King Arthur and his wizard, Merlin,

1298
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:05,703
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes at Mount Badon.

1299
01:14:05,786 --> 01:14:08,414
That's his sword and his mace there.

1300
01:14:08,997 --> 01:14:10,290
It's a myth.

1301
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:11,935
Yeah,
every legend, every myth,

1302
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:14,420
every story
whispered around the campfire

1303
01:14:14,586 --> 01:14:16,130
has a logical explanation.

1304
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:17,941
Oh, with that
I agree wholeheartedly,

1305
01:14:17,965 --> 01:14:19,245
but logic has left the building.

1306
01:14:19,341 --> 01:14:20,843
You're talking about magic.

1307
01:14:21,009 --> 01:14:23,345
What, like your walking,
talking Lamborghini?

1308
01:14:23,512 --> 01:14:25,055
"Any sufficiently advanced technology

1309
01:14:25,139 --> 01:14:26,682
"is indistinguishable from magic."

1310
01:14:26,849 --> 01:14:28,726
Arthur C. Clarke. Impressive.

1311
01:14:28,892 --> 01:14:30,936
Yeah. And count 'em,
zero student loans,

1312
01:14:31,019 --> 01:14:33,814
Doctor, or Professor, Philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

1313
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:36,316
It's all of the above.

1314
01:14:41,488 --> 01:14:42,906
Now, this place was built

1315
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:46,493
around the original Round Table.

1316
01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:50,122
Percival, Gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

1317
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:55,711
<i>They sat right here.</i>

1318
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,673
<i>Twelve in all.</i>

1319
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:04,511
<i>And behind them sat the 12
who came from Cybertron.</i>

1320
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:11,894
We fight for honor.

1321
01:15:12,853 --> 01:15:15,230
We fight for the human race.

1322
01:15:15,314 --> 01:15:17,399
For all that is good in mankind.

1323
01:15:18,025 --> 01:15:20,944
To brothers old and brothers new!

1324
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:24,573
To brothers old and brothers new!

1325
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:35,751
No sacrifice, no victory!

1326
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:39,505
Twelve alien knights
who saw in Camelot

1327
01:15:39,588 --> 01:15:42,174
what the human race
could be at its finest.

1328
01:15:42,674 --> 01:15:44,051
A race of honor.

1329
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:55,229
- Cogman?
- Hmm?

1330
01:15:55,437 --> 01:15:57,523
You ruined the moment again!

1331
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:00,234
I was making the moment more epic.

1332
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,652
Just be quiet.

1333
01:16:01,819 --> 01:16:03,487
What's the matter with you?

1334
01:16:03,654 --> 01:16:05,374
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

1335
01:16:06,073 --> 01:16:08,325
This belonged to King Arthur himself.

1336
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:12,746
Now, legend held that one last knight
would someday be chosen

1337
01:16:13,413 --> 01:16:16,124
<i>and the struggle
to save the world would begin.</i>

1338
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,377
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1339
01:16:19,294 --> 01:16:22,005
that that last knight is you.

1340
01:16:24,591 --> 01:16:25,592
What?

1341
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:27,904
You're saying he traveled
the whole universe to find me?

1342
01:16:27,928 --> 01:16:29,656
No, not you specifically.

1343
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,120
Not a failed inventor from
the state of Texas. No, God forbid.

1344
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:34,934
Stop it!

1345
01:16:35,435 --> 01:16:37,020
What?

1346
01:16:37,938 --> 01:16:39,332
You know, if you don't stop it,

1347
01:16:39,356 --> 01:16:41,984
I will send you back to Cybertron
in a little tiny box.

1348
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,080
Oh, scary.

1349
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,653
I am not a failed inventor.

1350
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:47,781
No, he meant the qualities
of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1351
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:50,951
Miss Viviane, the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

1352
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,012
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,

1353
01:16:53,036 --> 01:16:55,289
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1354
01:16:55,455 --> 01:16:56,455
I have those.

1355
01:16:56,498 --> 01:16:57,684
Oh, and most importantly...

1356
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,751
- Is he chaste?
- Chased?

1357
01:16:59,918 --> 01:17:01,604
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

1358
01:17:01,628 --> 01:17:02,988
brought me over here on the plane.

1359
01:17:03,338 --> 01:17:04,339
"Chaste."

1360
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,966
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1361
01:17:06,174 --> 01:17:07,217
"T."

1362
01:17:07,426 --> 01:17:08,426
Celibate?

1363
01:17:08,468 --> 01:17:09,908
Yeah, I know... I was making a joke.

1364
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,406
You don't think I know how to spell?

1365
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,181
- I know what he meant.
- Sure you were.

1366
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,892
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1367
01:17:16,018 --> 01:17:17,603
It's been a while.

1368
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:20,439
Well, how long's "a while"?
A week? A month? A year?

1369
01:17:20,606 --> 01:17:21,982
None of your business.

1370
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:23,669
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1371
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:25,569
A while!

1372
01:17:25,736 --> 01:17:26,945
- Huh.
- Hmm.

1373
01:17:27,696 --> 01:17:28,697
"Huh"? What is this?

1374
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,924
Is that, like, another English thing?

1375
01:17:29,948 --> 01:17:32,284
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1376
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,660
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1377
01:17:33,827 --> 01:17:35,495
What are you saving yourself for,
old age?

1378
01:17:35,662 --> 01:17:37,039
You, English lady, shut it.

1379
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:41,627
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1380
01:17:42,169 --> 01:17:43,769
Oh, this table
is from Cybertron.

1381
01:17:43,837 --> 01:17:46,924
It's a puzzle I've been working on
for some time.

1382
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:48,091
My entire life, actually.

1383
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,969
And what do these glyphs
say about it?

1384
01:17:51,136 --> 01:17:52,496
They're Olde Cybertronian.

1385
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,016
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1386
01:17:56,975 --> 01:17:58,602
<i>"Seglass Ni Tonday."</i>

1387
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:00,646
Wait a minute.

1388
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:02,189
I heard that before.

1389
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:06,360
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1390
01:18:06,526 --> 01:18:09,404
"With your dying breath,
protect the staff."

1391
01:18:10,656 --> 01:18:12,574
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1392
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:19,373
They had their name for it.

1393
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:21,333
We have ours.

1394
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,627
<i>The staff of Merlin.</i>

1395
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:28,131
<i>Bequeathed to him
by an alien race. Fused with his DNA.</i>

1396
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,927
So that only he would have the key
to unlock its alien power.

1397
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:35,347
Or as they knew it in those days,

1398
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:37,224
magic.

1399
01:18:39,351 --> 01:18:42,813
<i>The staff was buried with Merlin's body.</i>

1400
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:45,357
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1401
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:48,318
If it ever fell into the wrong hands,
it would mean

1402
01:18:48,527 --> 01:18:52,823
the imminent destruction
of everything we know and love.

1403
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:57,160
The 12 Guardian Knights combined
into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1404
01:18:57,244 --> 01:18:59,413
And now it is in great danger.

1405
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:02,124
Megatron. He was after this.

1406
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:03,792
So the battle is upon us.

1407
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,728
It is why they're here,
why they keep coming to Earth.

1408
01:19:05,752 --> 01:19:08,296
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

1409
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,923
Wait. We what?

1410
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:13,051
Only a direct descendant
of Merlin himself

1411
01:19:13,593 --> 01:19:16,596
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

1412
01:19:17,222 --> 01:19:19,683
And you, Miss Viviane,

1413
01:19:19,766 --> 01:19:22,894
are Merlin's last descendant
here on Earth, and as such,

1414
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:24,896
you are our last hope.

1415
01:19:25,063 --> 01:19:26,648
Okay, wait. Go back.

1416
01:19:26,732 --> 01:19:29,151
You're saying that I'm related
to the wizard Merlin?

1417
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:34,448
Oh. Oh.

1418
01:19:35,532 --> 01:19:36,616
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1419
01:19:37,617 --> 01:19:39,619
Only you know the staff's location,

1420
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:41,413
imparted to you by your father.

1421
01:19:42,122 --> 01:19:44,458
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1422
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,084
Are you sure?

1423
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:48,312
She doesn't have that
"I know where the staff is" look.

1424
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:51,089
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

1425
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:52,716
was to get out of his study.

1426
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:55,177
"Two worlds colliding,
only one survives."

1427
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,346
Your words exactly.
Only lecture time is over.

1428
01:19:58,555 --> 01:20:00,932
You were born for this.

1429
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,894
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

1430
01:20:04,102 --> 01:20:06,396
And you're all that stand in its way.

1431
01:20:06,563 --> 01:20:09,274
So you'd better find
that staff quickly. Now!

1432
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,252
<i>TRF.</i>

1433
01:20:11,276 --> 01:20:12,778
<i>Surround the castle and lock it down.</i>

1434
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:18,617
MI6 and TRF are here!

1435
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:20,494
Move it! Go!

1436
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,662
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1437
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,088
- The decoy car is ready?
- Hurry along.

1438
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,672
Whoa! I got 'em boys!

1439
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:39,137
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1440
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:42,046
Get us out of here, Bee.

1441
01:20:42,307 --> 01:20:45,519
Get out of here!
My weapon will stop the time!

1442
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:01,868
Oh! Einstein would've been
tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1443
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:06,957
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1444
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,376
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1445
01:21:17,884 --> 01:21:19,924
<i>Inbound helos, you are clear to land.</i>

1446
01:21:21,388 --> 01:21:23,308
<i>Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.</i>

1447
01:21:24,766 --> 01:21:27,060
This is Santos, Team Leader USA.
What you got?

1448
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,774
<i>TRF airship on the way.</i>

1449
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:41,491
Meet me around back, Bee.

1450
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:45,245
I suck at this game!

1451
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:47,390
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1452
01:21:47,414 --> 01:21:48,915
Mum?

1453
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,085
Everybody, this is Cade.

1454
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:54,588
Cade, this is my family.

1455
01:21:54,754 --> 01:21:55,755
Hello!

1456
01:21:55,922 --> 01:21:57,340
- Hi.
- Cade?

1457
01:21:57,507 --> 01:21:58,884
Hello. I'm Marie.

1458
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,247
Do you have a dungeon?

1459
01:22:00,302 --> 01:22:02,429
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

1460
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:03,930
He looks hard as wood.

1461
01:22:04,097 --> 01:22:06,391
Don't touch him.
Um, I'm gonna go and get changed.

1462
01:22:06,558 --> 01:22:09,811
I got a call from a very irate janitor
at Trinity Library.

1463
01:22:10,478 --> 01:22:11,771
<i>You're late.</i>

1464
01:22:11,938 --> 01:22:13,499
<i>We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.</i>

1465
01:22:13,523 --> 01:22:15,025
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1466
01:22:15,108 --> 01:22:17,569
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1467
01:22:20,947 --> 01:22:22,307
Quick! Get to the library!

1468
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:23,950
This chasing is stressing me out.

1469
01:22:27,954 --> 01:22:30,540
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

1470
01:22:30,624 --> 01:22:32,417
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1471
01:22:34,169 --> 01:22:35,754
So, finding the staff's location...

1472
01:22:35,921 --> 01:22:37,523
What does that mean?
We're looking for, like, what?

1473
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:39,299
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1474
01:22:39,382 --> 01:22:42,135
Holy shit! It'll take a year
to find something in here.

1475
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:44,679
I don't know where to find
this bloody staff.

1476
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:46,097
Look at this little fake horse.

1477
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:47,450
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1478
01:22:47,474 --> 01:22:48,714
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1479
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:52,062
What is going on up there?

1480
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,000
You checking behind pictures?

1481
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:56,428
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1482
01:22:56,983 --> 01:22:58,902
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

1483
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:00,129
Oh! This is exciting.

1484
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:02,656
- I can't get it out.
- Oh, wow. Great.

1485
01:23:02,822 --> 01:23:05,825
Oh, my God. Such a hoarder.

1486
01:23:07,744 --> 01:23:10,163
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1487
01:23:10,288 --> 01:23:11,581
Slow down.

1488
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,668
- I'm gonna take a peek.
- No!

1489
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:16,502
Come on, come on.

1490
01:23:16,544 --> 01:23:17,730
Answer me, come on!

1491
01:23:20,173 --> 01:23:21,651
<i>Damn you, tell me where it is!</i>

1492
01:23:21,675 --> 01:23:24,844
Not so fast. I want in.

1493
01:23:25,845 --> 01:23:27,847
To be a Witwiccan,
you have to be a special person.

1494
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:29,349
You, sir, are not.

1495
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:32,018
Read me into the club and I'll tell you.
Right here, now.

1496
01:23:32,185 --> 01:23:35,188
Over the phone?
That is absolutely barbaric.

1497
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:37,190
Over the phone. Do it, Englishman!

1498
01:23:37,357 --> 01:23:40,694
As the 12th Earl of Folgan,
by the power imbued

1499
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,903
<i>by His Majesty King Arthur</i>

1500
01:23:41,987 --> 01:23:43,863
<i>and his League of Knights
of the Round Table,</i>

1501
01:23:43,947 --> 01:23:46,157
<i>I now grant you,
Seymour Rutherford Simmons...</i>

1502
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:48,702
- Entrance into...
- "Admittance," not "entrance"!

1503
01:23:48,785 --> 01:23:50,263
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

1504
01:23:50,287 --> 01:23:52,956
Enough, enough, enough.
Just tell me! Now!

1505
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:54,124
Shh! Hush!

1506
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,501
Shut up! "Shh" yourselves.

1507
01:23:57,377 --> 01:23:58,837
What's the matter with you all?

1508
01:23:59,004 --> 01:24:00,004
Stack six, row C.

1509
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,716
Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums.
Let's go.

1510
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:04,819
I'm going! I'm going!
It's very confusing talking to you.

1511
01:24:04,843 --> 01:24:05,861
Come on, old man, get there!

1512
01:24:05,885 --> 01:24:07,485
Come on, Simmons,
you said no work today.

1513
01:24:07,554 --> 01:24:09,973
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

1514
01:24:10,056 --> 01:24:12,559
I'm working here, all right?
Five minutes, I swear!

1515
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:15,061
You always say five minutes.
That means no.

1516
01:24:15,228 --> 01:24:17,814
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

1517
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,149
I hate Rodrigo.

1518
01:24:19,316 --> 01:24:20,668
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

1519
01:24:20,692 --> 01:24:22,492
Okay, come on,
I'm in the middle of something.

1520
01:24:22,522 --> 01:24:23,331
Okay, back.

1521
01:24:23,361 --> 01:24:26,865
<i>They knew way back in the Dark Ages
where the end would begin.</i>

1522
01:24:27,073 --> 01:24:29,242
There is Cybertron and there is Earth.

1523
01:24:29,326 --> 01:24:31,053
Only they don't call it Earth at all,
they never did.

1524
01:24:31,077 --> 01:24:32,263
<i>They called it something else.</i>

1525
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:34,622
<i>One will suck the other dry,</i>

1526
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:37,709
a giant succubus,
until only one remains.

1527
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:39,085
Wow.

1528
01:24:40,253 --> 01:24:41,588
Earth is Unicron.

1529
01:24:42,088 --> 01:24:45,467
One day his horns will rise to fight
the mad goddess Quintessa.

1530
01:24:47,135 --> 01:24:49,596
<i>She will end our planet
to resurrect her own.</i>

1531
01:24:50,889 --> 01:24:51,890
Let's go. Hurry!

1532
01:24:52,057 --> 01:24:53,183
- Oh, my lord.
- Cogman, go!

1533
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:54,642
<i>Tell me where it goes down.</i>

1534
01:24:54,726 --> 01:24:56,019
I just Dropped it to you.

1535
01:24:56,102 --> 01:24:58,104
<i>The horns are the key to the location.</i>

1536
01:24:58,271 --> 01:24:59,832
<i>Why are they spread out
all over the Earth</i>

1537
01:24:59,856 --> 01:25:01,250
<i>in a jumble? The answer, they aren't.</i>

1538
01:25:01,274 --> 01:25:03,902
Time and Mother Nature
pulled them apart.

1539
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:05,546
That's Pangaea.
The supercontinent.

1540
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,130
<i>It's the same shape on the Round Table.</i>

1541
01:25:07,364 --> 01:25:08,448
Take a gander, Folgers,

1542
01:25:08,531 --> 01:25:11,618
at what's smack in the center
of that perfect circle.

1543
01:25:11,785 --> 01:25:13,787
- Genius!
- That's Stonehenge!

1544
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,705
One of the greatest mysteries
of the ages.

1545
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:17,415
No one understood its purpose
until now.

1546
01:25:17,624 --> 01:25:20,377
- No one. Except me.
- That's where it all begins.

1547
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,420
You're the man behind the man.
Do something.

1548
01:25:22,504 --> 01:25:24,422
<i>I'll handle it, Brother Simmons, fear not.</i>

1549
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:25,548
I never had a brother.

1550
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:28,802
Feels nice.

1551
01:25:28,968 --> 01:25:30,470
Beach time! Ready? Whoo!

1552
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:37,143
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1553
01:25:38,228 --> 01:25:39,562
What does that mean?

1554
01:25:39,729 --> 01:25:41,022
My secret cupboard!

1555
01:25:46,277 --> 01:25:47,737
Okay, okay.

1556
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:49,155
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1557
01:25:49,364 --> 01:25:52,325
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

1558
01:25:53,326 --> 01:25:55,161
Merlin and little girls, of course.

1559
01:25:59,874 --> 01:26:02,034
Navy Museum,
that's got to be where the staff is.

1560
01:26:02,127 --> 01:26:03,920
Oh, my God,
It was in my hands all along.

1561
01:26:07,966 --> 01:26:09,008
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1562
01:26:10,343 --> 01:26:12,387
- British TRF!
- Come on!

1563
01:26:13,847 --> 01:26:14,973
I surrender.

1564
01:26:16,307 --> 01:26:18,935
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1565
01:26:19,144 --> 01:26:21,064
Why'd you park
the decoy car so far away?

1566
01:26:21,146 --> 01:26:22,355
Oh, you are a fusspot!

1567
01:26:23,773 --> 01:26:25,692
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1568
01:26:26,985 --> 01:26:28,528
My speciality, my lord.

1569
01:26:46,838 --> 01:26:48,506
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1570
01:26:55,346 --> 01:26:57,015
Get out of the way!

1571
01:26:59,726 --> 01:27:01,478
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1572
01:27:01,644 --> 01:27:04,439
Wondered if you're available
for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1573
01:27:05,106 --> 01:27:07,266
Oh, I'd love a snuggle with Agnes.
Do I look available?

1574
01:27:18,286 --> 01:27:20,097
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way!
- Kamikaze pilot!

1575
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:22,290
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

1576
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:24,918
- Hello. Yes.
- Navy Museum.

1577
01:27:27,045 --> 01:27:28,588
Royal Navy Museum. I knew it!

1578
01:27:34,177 --> 01:27:35,737
<i>Bee, I'm gonna divert the cops!</i>

1579
01:27:39,265 --> 01:27:40,618
<i>A Decepticon has been seen...</i>

1580
01:27:40,642 --> 01:27:41,851
What do you mean, Decepticon?

1581
01:27:43,603 --> 01:27:45,443
- Here's where it gets intense.
- More intense?

1582
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,700
Bee?

1583
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,105
Goddamn, they're all around us

1584
01:28:07,252 --> 01:28:08,920
and I just have so much road rage!

1585
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:10,838
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1586
01:28:12,757 --> 01:28:14,384
Oh, you want some?

1587
01:28:16,803 --> 01:28:18,930
Cogman, blast them!

1588
01:28:30,984 --> 01:28:32,777
Good boy.

1589
01:28:34,696 --> 01:28:36,298
It's a one-way street!

1590
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:37,782
I'm not driving. He's driving.

1591
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,786
No!

1592
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:47,834
- Bee, head right, haul ass!
- Go!

1593
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:55,341
Whoa!

1594
01:29:03,057 --> 01:29:04,977
<i>That's how you get
to the big leagues.</i>

1595
01:29:07,687 --> 01:29:09,230
Oh, that hurt.

1596
01:29:09,856 --> 01:29:12,483
What the hell?
You are out of your mind!

1597
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,591
- Did we lose them?
- Hey, stop!

1598
01:29:18,615 --> 01:29:19,991
- You didn't pay!
- Sorry.

1599
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:22,535
It's all right, I've got them!
They just love submarines.

1600
01:29:24,996 --> 01:29:25,996
They're a bit rude.

1601
01:29:26,122 --> 01:29:28,350
Yes, they are, aren't they?
That's the modern generation.

1602
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:31,669
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1603
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:33,880
All you boys and girls,
off the sub now!

1604
01:29:34,047 --> 01:29:36,758
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

1605
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:39,135
Go on, push! Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

1606
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,260
Go, go, go!

1607
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,889
This thing isn't gonna run.

1608
01:29:43,056 --> 01:29:47,310
The mission's in deep,
unexplored waters.

1609
01:29:47,393 --> 01:29:49,020
It's wonderful!

1610
01:29:49,187 --> 01:29:51,898
And the sour-sweet musk of men
in close quarters.

1611
01:29:52,023 --> 01:29:53,858
It's quite disgusting, really.

1612
01:29:54,025 --> 01:29:55,360
But now this,

1613
01:29:55,526 --> 01:29:57,528
the greatest mission of them all,

1614
01:29:57,612 --> 01:30:00,031
one that I have longed for
my entire life...

1615
01:30:00,698 --> 01:30:04,911
To help turn the tide
of human history, you know?

1616
01:30:07,038 --> 01:30:09,415
Now, alas,

1617
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,418
I can no longer join you.

1618
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:16,839
But, my lord, you have been
waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1619
01:30:16,923 --> 01:30:19,926
I know, I know, but I'm not
knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1620
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:21,635
And, uh...

1621
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:23,739
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1622
01:30:23,763 --> 01:30:26,391
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving us in this tin can

1623
01:30:26,474 --> 01:30:28,685
with that four-foot mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

1624
01:30:28,768 --> 01:30:30,770
I prefer the word "sociopath."

1625
01:30:30,937 --> 01:30:32,897
Mr. Cade, everything you've done
in your life,

1626
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,066
your pain and your suffering,

1627
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:37,527
the loss of your wife,
separation from your daughter,

1628
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:38,986
your financial difficulties,

1629
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:43,116
it's all just been
a journey to this very moment.

1630
01:30:45,702 --> 01:30:47,161
You talk a lot.

1631
01:30:48,538 --> 01:30:50,623
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1632
01:30:51,582 --> 01:30:52,625
Um, my dear,

1633
01:30:53,543 --> 01:30:56,796
uh, your father left the <i>Alliance</i> to you,

1634
01:30:56,879 --> 01:30:58,089
for you alone.

1635
01:30:58,256 --> 01:31:00,133
She knows the way to the staff.

1636
01:31:00,299 --> 01:31:02,301
Good luck to both of you.

1637
01:31:03,636 --> 01:31:05,638
It won't be the strangest thing
I've done today.

1638
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,516
Oh...

1639
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:11,324
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1640
01:31:18,484 --> 01:31:19,652
Good luck!

1641
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:20,820
Whoa.

1642
01:31:21,946 --> 01:31:22,947
Oh, sh...

1643
01:31:23,156 --> 01:31:24,157
Whoa.

1644
01:31:24,449 --> 01:31:26,242
Okay. I didn't do that.

1645
01:31:27,452 --> 01:31:28,554
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1646
01:31:28,578 --> 01:31:30,830
The old World War II sub
jumped its moorings.

1647
01:31:30,997 --> 01:31:32,331
They're in a Transformer.

1648
01:31:42,175 --> 01:31:43,655
- Can I get a look?
- No, I'm looking.

1649
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:45,428
Will you move?

1650
01:31:45,511 --> 01:31:47,305
God, get out of the way, man!
Is that water?

1651
01:31:47,388 --> 01:31:49,891
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Obviously, it's water.

1652
01:31:50,028 --> 01:31:51,028
Do you know how to operate it?

1653
01:31:51,058 --> 01:31:52,202
You know how to operate it, right?

1654
01:31:52,226 --> 01:31:54,079
He says
you're in charge of this now.

1655
01:31:54,103 --> 01:31:56,023
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Don't touch me again!

1656
01:31:56,063 --> 01:31:57,440
Don't freak me out.

1657
01:31:57,523 --> 01:31:59,734
What happens in the alien ship
stays in the alien ship.

1658
01:32:00,026 --> 01:32:01,944
I will eff you up!

1659
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:05,656
<i>Surface,
I have positive surface contact.</i>

1660
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,158
<i>Track number 5205.</i>

1661
01:32:07,575 --> 01:32:08,677
The sub must be heading
for open water,

1662
01:32:08,701 --> 01:32:10,061
directly towards our strike group.

1663
01:32:10,161 --> 01:32:11,180
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1664
01:32:11,204 --> 01:32:12,330
Use whatever assets we have.

1665
01:32:12,455 --> 01:32:13,539
Contact the Zulu module.

1666
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,684
Have all our subs
converge on that chokepoint.

1667
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,543
<i>Helm, all ahead flank.</i>

1668
01:32:19,462 --> 01:32:20,856
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact,

1669
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,799
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

1670
01:32:22,965 --> 01:32:24,717
Contact bearing 150.

1671
01:32:30,389 --> 01:32:33,100
We need to get SEAL teams in DSVs.
We need to chase 'em.

1672
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:38,582
Control. Ace One, going to the bay.

1673
01:32:38,606 --> 01:32:39,774
Ace One, going to the bay.

1674
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,097
Cogman? Is that normal?

1675
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:55,373
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1676
01:32:55,456 --> 01:32:57,059
A nuclear-class attack submarine
is on our stern.

1677
01:32:57,083 --> 01:32:58,084
What?

1678
01:32:58,209 --> 01:32:59,794
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1679
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:01,254
It's your sub, not mine.

1680
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:05,007
My sub? Seven hours ago,
I was just a professor.

1681
01:33:09,178 --> 01:33:10,378
All right, uncoupling.

1682
01:33:19,772 --> 01:33:22,400
All right, let's move. Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

1683
01:33:26,445 --> 01:33:27,780
DSV-2, stay on our tail.

1684
01:33:29,031 --> 01:33:31,701
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1685
01:33:31,826 --> 01:33:33,369
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1686
01:33:33,452 --> 01:33:34,763
Why did he send us up here?

1687
01:33:34,787 --> 01:33:36,247
He got us up front so we die first.

1688
01:33:36,372 --> 01:33:37,391
Let's let them know we're here.

1689
01:33:37,415 --> 01:33:39,375
Warning shot.
Make tube one ready in all respects.

1690
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,543
Shoot tube one.

1691
01:33:49,427 --> 01:33:51,512
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

1692
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:03,232
Hold on!

1693
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:12,968
Conn, Sonar. It's coming back around.

1694
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,619
- It's gonna hit us!
- Brace for impact!

1695
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,163
Hold on!

1696
01:34:24,337 --> 01:34:25,838
Conn, Sonar. He's going deep!

1697
01:34:26,047 --> 01:34:28,174
We're clear for now.

1698
01:34:28,466 --> 01:34:31,469
Hands off! There is a time
and a place for everything.

1699
01:34:31,677 --> 01:34:34,096
This is not the time nor the place.

1700
01:34:34,513 --> 01:34:35,848
- Hey!
- Not now!

1701
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:38,184
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

1702
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:44,440
That little sicko just shot himself out
like a torpedo!

1703
01:34:44,607 --> 01:34:46,150
I know! I saw it!

1704
01:34:46,317 --> 01:34:47,652
Those are your peoples.

1705
01:34:55,368 --> 01:34:58,704
Good afternoon.
Is the, uh, Prime Minister in?

1706
01:34:58,788 --> 01:34:59,789
Who?

1707
01:35:00,164 --> 01:35:02,333
The Prime Minister, who else?
It's very urgent.

1708
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,044
Oh, it's urgent, is it?
Why didn't you say so?

1709
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:07,380
Oh. Thank you. Dickhead.

1710
01:35:07,546 --> 01:35:09,382
I'll use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

1711
01:35:09,882 --> 01:35:11,217
Get in there.

1712
01:35:21,894 --> 01:35:23,145
Oh, my... Sorry.

1713
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,990
Oh, I just got this thing
that was on my arm

1714
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:26,541
and it's, like, just moving all around.

1715
01:35:26,565 --> 01:35:30,569
Yeah.
It seems to not be, um... If you'd...

1716
01:35:31,153 --> 01:35:33,322
It's just sort of slithery...

1717
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,574
Slipping from the arm to the...

1718
01:35:35,825 --> 01:35:37,844
- Yeah, it's coming down.
- It's going down your pants there.

1719
01:35:37,868 --> 01:35:39,161
- Careful.
- Oh...

1720
01:35:39,745 --> 01:35:41,497
And is it tight or gripping on?

1721
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,058
It doesn't hurt,
but I don't know what it does.

1722
01:35:43,082 --> 01:35:44,750
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1723
01:35:44,917 --> 01:35:46,395
I think the purpose... I think the...

1724
01:35:46,419 --> 01:35:47,920
We'll find out what the purpose is.

1725
01:35:48,087 --> 01:35:49,714
If... If you want to.

1726
01:35:52,174 --> 01:35:54,760
Cogman! What is... What is all this?

1727
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,053
End of the world.

1728
01:35:56,137 --> 01:35:59,098
I thought a meal, a last meal,
would be in order.

1729
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:01,642
- Great. I'm starving.
- No canoodling.

1730
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:03,060
Wait, Cogman?

1731
01:36:06,397 --> 01:36:07,749
- Yep. My daughter would...
- So my grandma said...

1732
01:36:07,773 --> 01:36:09,316
My daughter would love this.

1733
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:10,329
My grandma would absolutely...

1734
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:11,461
She keeps saying I've got to move on.

1735
01:36:11,485 --> 01:36:12,921
Yeah, I was about to say.
She would love it.

1736
01:36:12,945 --> 01:36:14,363
- Really?
- Yes, all the time!

1737
01:36:14,488 --> 01:36:16,648
- What does she say?
- "Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

1738
01:36:16,699 --> 01:36:18,034
Is this a date?

1739
01:36:18,701 --> 01:36:21,328
- No. God, it's not a date. No.
- It's just that...

1740
01:36:21,412 --> 01:36:22,872
It's romantic.

1741
01:36:24,373 --> 01:36:26,459
Sushi <i>a la</i> Cogman!

1742
01:36:26,834 --> 01:36:28,002
Wow! Looks great.

1743
01:36:35,384 --> 01:36:36,969
No sacrifice,

1744
01:36:37,094 --> 01:36:38,137
no victory.

1745
01:36:42,058 --> 01:36:44,143
Is the President in his bunker?

1746
01:36:44,727 --> 01:36:45,811
He is.

1747
01:36:46,145 --> 01:36:47,646
How about Putin?

1748
01:36:48,939 --> 01:36:50,274
Son of a bitch.

1749
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,738
Are you the new Prime Minister?

1750
01:36:55,905 --> 01:36:57,823
Security, my office, now!

1751
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,950
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I used the old entrance.

1752
01:37:00,409 --> 01:37:02,453
That door is used
for extraordinary circumstances,

1753
01:37:02,536 --> 01:37:04,580
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

1754
01:37:05,081 --> 01:37:06,874
I will keep this very simple.

1755
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,693
Nasty little fellow.

1756
01:37:08,751 --> 01:37:11,504
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

1757
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:12,922
Do you understand?

1758
01:37:14,298 --> 01:37:15,424
Thank you.

1759
01:37:15,674 --> 01:37:17,510
Now, my name is Sir Edmond Burton,

1760
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:20,054
Her Majesty's Royal Navy,
Order of the Witwiccans,

1761
01:37:20,179 --> 01:37:22,848
keeper of the secret history
of Transformers here on Earth...

1762
01:37:23,015 --> 01:37:24,850
- Witwiccans?
- Witwiccans, yes.

1763
01:37:27,061 --> 01:37:28,938
But erm, they all died out.

1764
01:37:29,313 --> 01:37:32,566
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

1765
01:37:32,733 --> 01:37:34,860
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

1766
01:37:35,027 --> 01:37:36,707
- Hold on. You have just...
- Best shut up.

1767
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:38,757
- Emerged from the wall and now...
- Let me finish. Let me...

1768
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:40,074
Shut up!

1769
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:45,579
Shut up.

1770
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:49,375
Okay. As I said, I need you to marshal

1771
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,627
all your resources,
all your military assets.

1772
01:37:51,961 --> 01:37:54,338
Because as you no doubt
have surmised,

1773
01:37:54,421 --> 01:37:55,881
the world is going to end,

1774
01:37:56,257 --> 01:37:58,592
and I know where. And when.

1775
01:38:05,558 --> 01:38:09,311
You are the first to see this ship
since the Dark Ages.

1776
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:14,150
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

1777
01:38:27,997 --> 01:38:29,748
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1778
01:38:32,334 --> 01:38:34,712
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1779
01:38:35,045 --> 01:38:37,131
<i>We're starting to see it through the murk.</i>

1780
01:38:38,966 --> 01:38:40,634
<i>There's lights down here.</i>

1781
01:38:42,094 --> 01:38:44,930
Oh, my God. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

1782
01:38:45,514 --> 01:38:48,434
<i>Topside, are you catching this?
It's massive.</i>

1783
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,524
The ship knows we're here.

1784
01:39:12,082 --> 01:39:13,083
Stay on his tail.

1785
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:19,131
Oh, shit.

1786
01:39:24,303 --> 01:39:26,138
<i>The door just sealed.</i>

1787
01:39:26,972 --> 01:39:28,766
Try those tubes.

1788
01:39:29,683 --> 01:39:31,602
DSV-2, stay close. Stay close.

1789
01:39:32,144 --> 01:39:33,479
<i>Topside, we're going in.</i>

1790
01:39:34,271 --> 01:39:35,981
We're gonna lose radio contact.

1791
01:39:47,005 --> 01:39:48,005
We're in a current!

1792
01:39:48,035 --> 01:39:50,035
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Steady, steady, steady!

1793
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,872
Use the arms to keep us...

1794
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,061
- Keep control!
- Stay off the wall!

1795
01:39:56,085 --> 01:39:57,285
- Hold it!
- Stay off the wall!

1796
01:40:19,316 --> 01:40:20,317
What now?

1797
01:40:20,776 --> 01:40:21,986
You're the last knight.

1798
01:40:22,069 --> 01:40:26,031
You're the Earl's special guy.
You figure it out.

1799
01:40:26,865 --> 01:40:28,492
Let's go.

1800
01:40:29,285 --> 01:40:30,828
I'm not going in that water.

1801
01:40:30,911 --> 01:40:33,998
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

1802
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:39,712
Now you're both on my shit list.

1803
01:41:06,155 --> 01:41:07,698
We were blinded.

1804
01:41:08,073 --> 01:41:09,575
Blinded by the sun.

1805
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:12,619
The planet hid its approach
behind our star.

1806
01:41:13,078 --> 01:41:16,415
It seems to be acting deliberately.

1807
01:41:40,481 --> 01:41:42,524
Dozens of strikes
currently modeled.

1808
01:41:43,442 --> 01:41:46,195
First impact will be Alpha Station.

1809
01:41:46,278 --> 01:41:47,279
There is no escape pod.

1810
01:41:48,447 --> 01:41:50,366
<i>Earth will follow two hours later.</i>

1811
01:41:50,657 --> 01:41:53,744
Dominic modeled potential casualties
in the tens of millions.

1812
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:57,456
There's two moons!

1813
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:59,249
There's two moons!

1814
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,460
The world is ending?

1815
01:42:02,503 --> 01:42:04,397
<i>Some are saying that
it's going to be a global killer.</i>

1816
01:42:04,421 --> 01:42:05,815
<i>Human civilization
as we know it</i>

1817
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:07,466
<i>will change in 12 hours.</i>

1818
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,219
<i>The destruction, we're told
by experts, will be immense.</i>

1819
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:28,463
This is unbelievable.

1820
01:42:28,487 --> 01:42:29,727
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

1821
01:42:29,863 --> 01:42:31,303
What does the old man want us to do?

1822
01:42:33,158 --> 01:42:34,576
Whoa!

1823
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:38,872
Whoa.

1824
01:42:39,248 --> 01:42:40,888
Bee, go around, find another way!
Come on!

1825
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:42,143
<i>What? Are you serious?</i>

1826
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,211
<i>Think I like winding up
in a place like this?</i>

1827
01:42:50,592 --> 01:42:52,511
It wants us to go this way.

1828
01:42:53,971 --> 01:42:54,972
Whoa.

1829
01:42:55,431 --> 01:42:58,058
Daytrader! Son of a bitch
actually came through with our ship!

1830
01:42:58,225 --> 01:43:00,769
Excellent. We are going to England.

1831
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:02,980
Things are likely to get nasty.
Real nasty.

1832
01:43:03,063 --> 01:43:05,524
Hey, can I come? He might need me.

1833
01:43:05,983 --> 01:43:09,403
Oh, little lady, hell,
I ain't no Earth parent. Hop aboard.

1834
01:43:09,486 --> 01:43:11,363
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1835
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,656
Let's go make some noise.

1836
01:43:12,739 --> 01:43:14,366
Let's give 'em hell.

1837
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,201
I'm driving.

1838
01:43:17,077 --> 01:43:19,663
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant
to say this to you, but.

1839
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,916
I think that you're quite,
you know, brave.

1840
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:24,543
Is that a compliment?

1841
01:43:25,461 --> 01:43:27,296
You could throw one back my way.

1842
01:43:27,379 --> 01:43:29,214
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1843
01:43:30,215 --> 01:43:31,758
I was the first off the sub.

1844
01:43:38,515 --> 01:43:40,142
Hold it! Hold.

1845
01:43:40,976 --> 01:43:42,186
I think it's here!

1846
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:17,471
It's a tomb.

1847
01:44:19,556 --> 01:44:20,742
<i>Station, Houston.</i>

1848
01:44:20,766 --> 01:44:23,936
<i>Page five of the safe zone
config procedure.</i>

1849
01:44:24,436 --> 01:44:26,396
<i>Take thrusters to auto.</i>

1850
01:44:28,273 --> 01:44:29,775
It's happening.

1851
01:44:30,442 --> 01:44:32,069
It's in our atmosphere now.

1852
01:44:32,277 --> 01:44:33,654
<i>ISS is our first hit.</i>

1853
01:44:34,112 --> 01:44:35,906
<i>Progress manifolds both failed.</i>

1854
01:44:36,114 --> 01:44:37,699
<i>No thrusters available.</i>

1855
01:44:38,492 --> 01:44:40,452
<i>Conjunction is imminent.</i>

1856
01:44:40,994 --> 01:44:43,664
<i>Good luck and Godspeed.</i>

1857
01:44:52,714 --> 01:44:54,314
Move in, move in, check up.

1858
01:45:02,766 --> 01:45:04,184
Formality.

1859
01:45:05,394 --> 01:45:07,396
Knights are always guarding something.

1860
01:45:10,315 --> 01:45:11,483
Hang on. Look at this.

1861
01:45:12,276 --> 01:45:13,318
It's Celtic.

1862
01:45:34,339 --> 01:45:35,841
It's Merlin.

1863
01:45:36,592 --> 01:45:37,676
It's real.

1864
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,386
All of it!

1865
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,221
Wait, what does this say?

1866
01:45:44,057 --> 01:45:45,559
It means, "No one shall have it."

1867
01:45:46,184 --> 01:45:49,146
Wait a minute. We came all the way
down here, all this,

1868
01:45:49,938 --> 01:45:51,481
and you're not gonna open it?

1869
01:45:52,524 --> 01:45:53,764
Of course I'm going to open it.

1870
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:55,861
Good. Let's go.

1871
01:45:56,403 --> 01:45:58,363
Ready? Let's do this.

1872
01:46:11,543 --> 01:46:12,544
You got to be kidding me.

1873
01:46:16,381 --> 01:46:18,342
We've come all this way for this?

1874
01:46:18,884 --> 01:46:20,524
For your ugly
great-great granddad's bones

1875
01:46:20,552 --> 01:46:22,638
in a box and some stupid stick?

1876
01:46:22,971 --> 01:46:23,972
You got to be kidding me.

1877
01:46:24,056 --> 01:46:25,696
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

1878
01:46:25,724 --> 01:46:28,393
I could've cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

1879
01:46:28,852 --> 01:46:30,270
Don't say a word. Okay?

1880
01:46:30,354 --> 01:46:33,065
The smooth little romantic accent's
not gonna work right now.

1881
01:46:33,857 --> 01:46:35,859
- I'm speechless.
- Thank God.

1882
01:46:36,026 --> 01:46:37,402
Maybe someone stole it?

1883
01:46:37,903 --> 01:46:40,184
No, there's something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

1884
01:46:41,114 --> 01:46:43,116
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

1885
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:45,452
The whole world's at stake.

1886
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,754
Guys, the meters are freaking.

1887
01:46:56,505 --> 01:46:59,257
I got thermals everywhere.
These things, they...

1888
01:47:00,509 --> 01:47:02,177
They could still be alive.

1889
01:47:04,346 --> 01:47:06,348
The hell happened to you?

1890
01:47:14,272 --> 01:47:17,025
Who has come for the staff?

1891
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:20,445
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1892
01:47:24,658 --> 01:47:26,702
- Move!
- Get out!

1893
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:32,082
I'm going to distract him.
Get out of here.

1894
01:47:34,668 --> 01:47:36,878
- I have the staff!
- Hit it!

1895
01:47:45,262 --> 01:47:47,264
Protect the staff.

1896
01:47:52,978 --> 01:47:54,271
Take his eyes out!

1897
01:48:25,719 --> 01:48:27,479
Whoa, who, whoa,
this thing's moving.

1898
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,848
Corner her!

1899
01:48:30,015 --> 01:48:31,183
Hey.

1900
01:48:31,516 --> 01:48:32,893
Drop the weapon.

1901
01:48:35,228 --> 01:48:36,228
Do it!

1902
01:48:39,608 --> 01:48:41,276
You drop it, or I will.

1903
01:48:44,404 --> 01:48:45,798
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox. Stop!

1904
01:48:45,822 --> 01:48:46,907
All I want is that weapon!

1905
01:48:47,032 --> 01:48:48,325
- Go ahead, shoot me!
- No!

1906
01:48:48,867 --> 01:48:50,535
Only I can wield it.

1907
01:48:50,827 --> 01:48:51,870
Go on!

1908
01:48:52,954 --> 01:48:54,206
Do it!

1909
01:48:54,873 --> 01:48:56,333
Shoot me!

1910
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:58,141
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox.

1911
01:48:59,711 --> 01:49:00,837
Don't.

1912
01:49:02,839 --> 01:49:04,424
Protect the staff.

1913
01:49:21,983 --> 01:49:24,820
I've come for that staff.

1914
01:49:31,368 --> 01:49:33,745
Optimus... What are you doing?

1915
01:49:34,287 --> 01:49:35,539
Give it to me.

1916
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,250
It's me, Cade. We fought together.

1917
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:42,629
I fight for my own kind! My own planet!

1918
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,965
- Cade?
- This isn't you, Prime.

1919
01:49:45,131 --> 01:49:47,592
Give me the staff, human.

1920
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,261
Cade?

1921
01:49:50,053 --> 01:49:51,930
I will kill you.

1922
01:49:52,013 --> 01:49:53,014
Give it to him.

1923
01:49:59,145 --> 01:50:00,145
Now.

1924
01:50:14,286 --> 01:50:16,788
Who dares to challenge me?

1925
01:50:25,463 --> 01:50:26,631
It's all wrong, Bee.

1926
01:50:26,798 --> 01:50:28,358
Something happened.
That is not Optimus.

1927
01:50:28,425 --> 01:50:30,635
You got to find him, Bee.
Remember ZB-7?

1928
01:50:30,802 --> 01:50:32,637
You got to be that Autobot again.

1929
01:50:32,888 --> 01:50:34,824
Look you got to get back to the sub,
all right? Get out of here.

1930
01:50:34,848 --> 01:50:35,974
Wait, what about you?

1931
01:50:36,057 --> 01:50:38,393
Bee's always had my back.
It's my turn to have his. Go.

1932
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,954
All right, get back to the DSV.

1933
01:50:39,978 --> 01:50:42,314
Let them know up top
that we lost control of the weapon.

1934
01:50:42,439 --> 01:50:43,773
Roger that, sir.

1935
01:50:43,982 --> 01:50:45,817
You heard him. Back to the sub!

1936
01:50:45,942 --> 01:50:47,444
We're gonna find him.

1937
01:51:41,581 --> 01:51:43,221
Come on,
we got to get to the top!

1938
01:51:46,127 --> 01:51:48,463
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1939
01:51:49,714 --> 01:51:51,341
We can make it! Come on!

1940
01:52:05,897 --> 01:52:07,899
Watch out, big wave coming!

1941
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:09,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1942
01:52:26,793 --> 01:52:29,170
I am Nemesis Prime.

1943
01:52:30,463 --> 01:52:32,632
You are nothing!

1944
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,931
Move it!

1945
01:52:40,807 --> 01:52:42,807
<i>Air's gonna be on station 14 to 16.</i>

1946
01:52:42,934 --> 01:52:45,770
<i>TOC, it looks like
we have a surfaced alien ship.</i>

1947
01:52:46,813 --> 01:52:49,232
<i>Lightning 4
has visual on Optimus.</i>

1948
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,488
Prime! Prime, stop!

1949
01:52:55,822 --> 01:52:58,783
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

1950
01:52:59,367 --> 01:53:00,452
Look at me, Prime.

1951
01:53:00,785 --> 01:53:03,038
What are you doing? It's Bee!

1952
01:53:03,288 --> 01:53:05,373
Prime! You can't do this.

1953
01:53:40,909 --> 01:53:42,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1954
01:53:50,085 --> 01:53:51,169
Prime!

1955
01:53:53,004 --> 01:53:54,506
Stop! No!

1956
01:53:55,381 --> 01:53:59,844
I am Bumblebee,
your oldest friend.

1957
01:54:00,428 --> 01:54:01,763
Optimus,

1958
01:54:02,514 --> 01:54:05,600
I would lay down my life for you.

1959
01:54:13,817 --> 01:54:16,986
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1960
01:54:17,529 --> 01:54:19,030
I have not heard it

1961
01:54:19,572 --> 01:54:21,866
since Cybertron fell.

1962
01:54:35,755 --> 01:54:38,758
What have I done?

1963
01:54:49,769 --> 01:54:52,605
You blew
your chance to kill Unicron.

1964
01:54:53,398 --> 01:54:55,900
I knew you couldn't do it.

1965
01:54:56,401 --> 01:54:59,195
Your time is over, Prime.

1966
01:54:59,571 --> 01:55:01,656
You failed.

1967
01:55:01,739 --> 01:55:04,951
You turned your back on Cybertron.

1968
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:08,204
Now you will watch Earth die.

1969
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:11,541
No!

1970
01:55:18,256 --> 01:55:19,966
Not going so well.

1971
01:55:31,603 --> 01:55:32,604
Cade!

1972
01:55:38,109 --> 01:55:40,862
You betrayed your own kind.

1973
01:55:41,112 --> 01:55:42,447
No, Prime, get up!

1974
01:55:42,614 --> 01:55:45,116
You chose the wrong side.

1975
01:55:45,283 --> 01:55:49,913
The Guardian Knights
are going to kill me.

1976
01:55:50,121 --> 01:55:52,582
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

1977
01:56:00,006 --> 01:56:03,218
The judgment is death.

1978
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:37,377
<i>Seglass Ni Tonday.</i>

1979
01:56:38,127 --> 01:56:40,463
<i>Seglass Ni Tonday.</i>

1980
01:56:40,546 --> 01:56:44,133
<i>Seglass Ni Tonday.</i>

1981
01:56:57,438 --> 01:57:00,608
Cade, I have failed you.

1982
01:57:03,278 --> 01:57:05,321
I have doomed Earth.

1983
01:57:07,031 --> 01:57:10,618
Earth, the only place in the universe

1984
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:14,372
whose people let me call it

1985
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,041
home.

1986
01:57:21,337 --> 01:57:23,339
Only you can make it right, Prime.

1987
01:57:24,966 --> 01:57:26,634
I can't do it without you.

1988
01:57:27,802 --> 01:57:29,804
One moment, that's all we got.

1989
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:32,598
It's up to you, Prime.

1990
01:57:33,016 --> 01:57:34,100
Because without you,

1991
01:57:35,018 --> 01:57:36,352
we all die.

1992
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:40,898
It's now or never.

1993
01:57:41,941 --> 01:57:43,443
My brothers,

1994
01:57:43,943 --> 01:57:47,780
I will never betray you again.

1995
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:51,534
I am Optimus Prime.

1996
01:57:51,617 --> 01:57:55,455
To save Earth, we must go to Cybertron

1997
01:57:55,747 --> 01:57:58,416
and destroy Quintessa.

1998
01:58:21,647 --> 01:58:23,483
The ship is coming.

1999
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,443
It is beautiful.

2000
01:58:37,747 --> 01:58:39,874
Optimus Prime gave us
the coordinates for the endgame.

2001
01:58:39,957 --> 01:58:41,167
It's an ignition chamber.

2002
01:58:41,459 --> 01:58:42,835
<i>The weapon's going up there.</i>

2003
01:58:43,294 --> 01:58:44,614
Get Preds and satellites eyes on.

2004
01:58:44,754 --> 01:58:47,173
Find it and prepare to engage.

2005
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,152
Cyclops, 21,000 feet.

2006
01:58:50,176 --> 01:58:52,136
Eyeball target, ignition chamber.
We found it.

2007
01:58:52,303 --> 01:58:53,781
<i>Prime's coordinates are good.</i>

2008
01:58:53,805 --> 01:58:56,125
Contact,
ignition chamber. Target in sight.

2009
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:58,893
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

2010
01:58:58,976 --> 01:59:01,020
We've got to figure out
what makes it tick.

2011
01:59:01,396 --> 01:59:03,064
We've got to shut it down!

2012
01:59:04,232 --> 01:59:05,691
Come on, come on, come on!

2013
01:59:06,567 --> 01:59:07,902
Good to see you.

2014
01:59:07,985 --> 01:59:09,570
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

2015
01:59:12,698 --> 01:59:14,200
General, we're gonna prep
a HALO jump

2016
01:59:14,283 --> 01:59:15,326
on that ignition chamber.

2017
01:59:15,868 --> 01:59:17,508
Planes will never nav
through those vines.

2018
01:59:17,745 --> 01:59:20,373
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

2019
01:59:21,165 --> 01:59:23,459
<i>Our Autobot ship.
Put the Ospreys in that.</i>

2020
01:59:23,543 --> 01:59:24,836
<i>It'll get us up there.</i>

2021
01:59:25,002 --> 01:59:26,754
<i>Autobot ship's gonna drop the Ospreys.</i>

2022
01:59:26,838 --> 01:59:29,158
<i>They'll virtually glide to the LZ.
It's gonna be high-risk.</i>

2023
01:59:29,215 --> 01:59:31,717
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

2024
01:59:31,926 --> 01:59:34,095
Sir, there's this girl.
Woman, actually. Teacher.

2025
01:59:34,178 --> 01:59:36,180
- Oxford.
- She plays a little polo.

2026
01:59:37,265 --> 01:59:39,350
Well, that's fantastic.

2027
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,203
<i>They're gonna
break her into the chamber</i>

2028
01:59:41,227 --> 01:59:42,353
<i>to steal the staff.</i>

2029
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,149
Okay, that is the dumbest idea
you could possibly have!

2030
01:59:46,357 --> 01:59:48,609
<i>Personally, I'm gonna rely on
physics and mathematics</i>

2031
01:59:48,693 --> 01:59:49,694
<i>to save the planet,</i>

2032
01:59:49,777 --> 01:59:52,280
<i>not mysticism, fairies,
and some hobgoblins.</i>

2033
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:11,466
I've lived for this.

2034
02:00:11,549 --> 02:00:13,926
I've lived to kill a planet!

2035
02:00:14,927 --> 02:00:18,055
For our world, I activate this portal!

2036
02:00:34,822 --> 02:00:35,948
Fire!

2037
02:00:58,429 --> 02:01:00,848
You wretched human!

2038
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:20,910
Hey!

2039
02:01:25,623 --> 02:01:26,958
Hey.

2040
02:01:28,626 --> 02:01:30,545
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

2041
02:01:30,628 --> 02:01:31,754
Come on.

2042
02:01:34,173 --> 02:01:35,174
Hey!

2043
02:01:35,675 --> 02:01:37,843
I just found Optimus Prime!

2044
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:40,972
He's gonna deal with all this shit!

2045
02:01:41,472 --> 02:01:43,474
He's gonna save our asses!

2046
02:01:44,642 --> 02:01:47,103
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

2047
02:01:47,979 --> 02:01:49,855
Knights, Autobots,

2048
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:53,859
this cannot and will not be the end.

2049
02:01:55,486 --> 02:01:58,197
To save Earth and her people,

2050
02:01:58,489 --> 02:02:01,659
we are going to steal Quintessa's staff.

2051
02:02:02,285 --> 02:02:05,288
Only you, Viviane, can take it back.

2052
02:02:07,164 --> 02:02:09,667
I will lead the way into her chamber.

2053
02:02:11,502 --> 02:02:15,548
And when the account of the ages
is etched into the cosmos,

2054
02:02:15,881 --> 02:02:19,635
let those who exist long after us know

2055
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:23,764
that this was our finest hour.

2056
02:02:29,645 --> 02:02:32,523
Love that guy. Goosebumps every time.

2057
02:02:32,857 --> 02:02:34,150
I never got to say hi.

2058
02:02:37,028 --> 02:02:38,529
Here they come.

2059
02:02:38,821 --> 02:02:40,364
You think there's enough?

2060
02:02:40,448 --> 02:02:41,866
No, not even close.

2061
02:02:44,368 --> 02:02:46,162
My lord! Lord Folgan!

2062
02:02:56,255 --> 02:02:57,923
I had it, Cogman.

2063
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:01,552
I had my moment.

2064
02:03:03,512 --> 02:03:05,181
You did, my lord.

2065
02:03:06,807 --> 02:03:08,643
This is the hardest part of my job.

2066
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:11,771
Watching Folgans die.

2067
02:03:12,938 --> 02:03:14,899
Thank you, Cogman.

2068
02:03:15,441 --> 02:03:16,776
Carry on.

2069
02:03:21,405 --> 02:03:24,909
Of all the earls I have had
the pleasure to serve,

2070
02:03:25,409 --> 02:03:27,662
you were by far the coolest.

2071
02:03:40,758 --> 02:03:43,094
I have found
your staff of power.

2072
02:03:44,428 --> 02:03:46,639
There is only one
who can hurt us.

2073
02:03:47,098 --> 02:03:50,309
I felt her. She must not enter.

2074
02:03:50,685 --> 02:03:52,728
My army will stop them.

2075
02:03:53,813 --> 02:03:58,109
Watch as our world heals
and theirs dies.

2076
02:03:59,110 --> 02:04:01,112
A world reborn!

2077
02:04:26,971 --> 02:04:28,305
It's coming.

2078
02:04:43,237 --> 02:04:44,780
It's gonna crush us.

2079
02:04:44,947 --> 02:04:46,615
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

2080
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:48,784
- We got to bail!
- Move to the Ospreys!

2081
02:04:58,502 --> 02:05:00,838
Move, move, move!
To the Ospreys!

2082
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:02,890
That thing's gonna
roll right over us!

2083
02:05:11,682 --> 02:05:12,683
Move!

2084
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:26,131
<i>Preliminary numbers</i>

2085
02:05:26,155 --> 02:05:27,490
<i>are starting to come in.</i>

2086
02:05:27,573 --> 02:05:31,619
<i>Literally scraping away cities.
Millions will die.</i>

2087
02:05:45,382 --> 02:05:47,218
It's using Earth's geothermal energy

2088
02:05:47,384 --> 02:05:49,184
<i>to reconstitute,
to rebuild itself, all right?</i>

2089
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:52,389
<i>If our core cools,
which is rapidly cooling right now,</i>

2090
02:05:52,556 --> 02:05:54,558
<i>the magnetic field dissolves,
exposing us</i>

2091
02:05:54,892 --> 02:05:56,644
to high levels of cosmic radiation.

2092
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,021
Maybe you'll understand this.

2093
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:00,898
<i>The Earth becomes a microwave.</i>

2094
02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:03,692
We're the popcorn. Jiffy Pop bag goes

2095
02:06:03,901 --> 02:06:05,152
boom.

2096
02:06:05,778 --> 02:06:07,780
We fry.

2097
02:06:21,001 --> 02:06:22,586
Very mean looking.

2098
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:25,464
Oh, they look like wusses to me.

2099
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,758
<i>No, they all messed up.</i>

2100
02:06:28,592 --> 02:06:30,469
Two minutes! Hey, two minutes!

2101
02:06:31,262 --> 02:06:33,055
- That thing kill Decepticons?
- No.

2102
02:06:34,139 --> 02:06:35,474
We do.

2103
02:06:37,685 --> 02:06:41,021
"A few brave warriors
willing to sacrifice all."

2104
02:06:41,772 --> 02:06:44,275
I told my students that was bullshit.

2105
02:06:44,608 --> 02:06:46,110
Load out, let's go!

2106
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:48,940
What are you doing tomorrow?

2107
02:06:49,113 --> 02:06:50,489
Are you asking me that now?

2108
02:06:50,573 --> 02:06:51,699
Yeah, I am.

2109
02:06:51,907 --> 02:06:54,243
No plans? Good.

2110
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:56,287
Get in the plane.

2111
02:06:57,079 --> 02:06:58,914
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's step it up!

2112
02:06:59,123 --> 02:07:01,323
Strap in.
It's gonna be a rough ride.

2113
02:07:01,584 --> 02:07:02,936
- Tighter.
- I'm gonna hook you up.

2114
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,600
Pull it down tight, right? Just this one?

2115
02:07:04,712 --> 02:07:05,713
You jump...

2116
02:07:05,796 --> 02:07:07,607
- Then pull this, right?
- This is the one I pull, right?

2117
02:07:07,631 --> 02:07:09,831
Pull? Just pull it?
You just pull it as hard as you can?

2118
02:07:10,175 --> 02:07:11,260
Are you all right?

2119
02:07:11,844 --> 02:07:14,555
Can I borrow your cell phone?
I've got to text my daughter.

2120
02:07:14,763 --> 02:07:15,764
Thanks.

2121
02:07:23,689 --> 02:07:24,690
All right.

2122
02:07:25,149 --> 02:07:26,483
Thank you.

2123
02:07:37,536 --> 02:07:38,871
<i>Target in sight.</i>

2124
02:07:40,539 --> 02:07:41,832
<i>Contact, ignition chamber.</i>

2125
02:07:41,999 --> 02:07:43,542
<i>Strike package. Execute. Execute.</i>

2126
02:07:43,667 --> 02:07:45,437
<i>Fight's on, fight's on, fight's on.</i>

2127
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:57,514
<i>Bogeys inbound. Bogeys inbound.</i>

2128
02:07:57,848 --> 02:08:00,351
Bee, get to your ship. Good luck.

2129
02:08:01,018 --> 02:08:02,353
Thirty seconds to drop!

2130
02:08:03,145 --> 02:08:05,022
Those birds better be
softening our target.

2131
02:08:05,105 --> 02:08:07,225
You're not giving me
that warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2132
02:08:07,441 --> 02:08:08,835
The Osprey's flight ceiling
is 12,000 feet.

2133
02:08:08,859 --> 02:08:10,152
We're double that.

2134
02:08:10,277 --> 02:08:12,237
The air's too thin,
the rotor's got no grab.

2135
02:08:12,363 --> 02:08:13,781
We're gonna be coming in hard.

2136
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:16,325
- It's all bad news.
- Oh, yeah.

2137
02:08:18,994 --> 02:08:20,079
All good, Yeager?

2138
02:08:20,537 --> 02:08:21,956
You got something to say?

2139
02:08:22,456 --> 02:08:24,208
You and your guys
never stopped hunting me.

2140
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:26,502
Orders. You were with them.

2141
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:27,753
With "them"?

2142
02:08:28,253 --> 02:08:29,964
I believed in one of the great ones.

2143
02:08:30,047 --> 02:08:32,424
Optimus Prime. And his crew.
I never lost faith.

2144
02:08:33,217 --> 02:08:35,219
You did. The whole world did.

2145
02:08:35,552 --> 02:08:37,012
Now you want to fly with me.

2146
02:08:39,306 --> 02:08:42,267
Well, I appreciate you guys
making the trip. Thank you.

2147
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:49,566
Get that staff,

2148
02:08:50,776 --> 02:08:52,277
we all go home.

2149
02:08:58,909 --> 02:09:01,036
<i>Lennox, your team is to hold.</i>

2150
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,705
<i>Strike fighters are getting shot down.</i>

2151
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:06,458
Oh. no, it's now or never.
Pilots, go now! Go!

2152
02:09:06,625 --> 02:09:07,876
Hang on!

2153
02:09:08,502 --> 02:09:09,502
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

2154
02:09:09,545 --> 02:09:11,964
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

2155
02:09:12,381 --> 02:09:14,008
But you said we were family.

2156
02:09:14,591 --> 02:09:16,760
No, I didn't mean...
We got to get her off here now.

2157
02:09:17,636 --> 02:09:18,929
It was probably a bad idea.

2158
02:09:25,269 --> 02:09:26,909
<i>Six birds out of the nest.</i>

2159
02:09:27,021 --> 02:09:28,439
Whoo-hoo!

2160
02:09:33,652 --> 02:09:34,713
<i>All Ospreys clear.</i>

2161
02:09:34,737 --> 02:09:36,280
<i>Push the target, push the target.</i>

2162
02:09:39,867 --> 02:09:40,909
Hang on!

2163
02:09:41,452 --> 02:09:43,537
<i>- Chihuahua.</i>
- It's okay. It's okay.

2164
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:55,710
<i>All fast movers, distract, distract.</i>

2165
02:09:55,799 --> 02:09:57,777
<i>Keep those
enemies away from the Ospreys!</i>

2166
02:09:57,801 --> 02:09:59,428
Bogeys dead ahead!

2167
02:10:04,475 --> 02:10:06,977
<i>Control,
spread it out, spread it out.</i>

2168
02:10:13,525 --> 02:10:15,765
Those fighters
better distract those enemy ships!

2169
02:10:18,322 --> 02:10:20,562
<i>I got bogeys
coming in hot, one o'clock.</i>

2170
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:26,770
<i>I got three bogeys.</i>

2171
02:10:29,958 --> 02:10:31,358
Watch the rotor!

2172
02:10:34,505 --> 02:10:36,006
Sir, bird three just went down!

2173
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:58,195
There's our landing zone.

2174
02:11:00,697 --> 02:11:02,074
Take that big gun out.

2175
02:11:03,867 --> 02:11:05,869
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2176
02:11:12,918 --> 02:11:14,545
Hold on, we're going down!

2177
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:15,814
<i>It's gonna be a hard hit.</i>

2178
02:11:15,838 --> 02:11:17,023
<i>Don't slide off the edge!</i>

2179
02:11:17,047 --> 02:11:18,487
<i>Brace, brace, brace!</i>

2180
02:11:19,842 --> 02:11:21,510
<i>Two's down, two's down.</i>

2181
02:11:31,478 --> 02:11:32,563
Brace for impact!

2182
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,782
- Out of the bird!
- Grab a buddy!

2183
02:11:46,577 --> 02:11:47,857
Get out of the bird! Go!

2184
02:11:48,537 --> 02:11:50,080
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2185
02:11:54,293 --> 02:11:55,293
Enemy fighters!

2186
02:12:31,955 --> 02:12:34,208
That gun emplacement
is tearing us apart!

2187
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:41,423
There's the ignition chamber,
dead ahead!

2188
02:12:46,053 --> 02:12:47,893
<i>Air cover not coming. Unable.</i>

2189
02:12:50,974 --> 02:12:52,100
Whoo-hoo!

2190
02:12:52,184 --> 02:12:53,518
Let's ride, Bee!

2191
02:12:53,644 --> 02:12:54,811
Let's kick ass!

2192
02:13:01,985 --> 02:13:03,987
Push right to the crater! Let's go!

2193
02:13:14,915 --> 02:13:16,959
Pinned down with the Hound!

2194
02:13:19,169 --> 02:13:21,004
No way. Where's Optimus?

2195
02:13:21,088 --> 02:13:23,006
They said he never made it.

2196
02:13:23,507 --> 02:13:24,883
We got the big gun on us!

2197
02:13:25,133 --> 02:13:26,677
We're pinned down!

2198
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:30,305
Negative to target. Unable to advance.

2199
02:13:32,975 --> 02:13:34,810
- Get back here, Izzy!
- Izzy!

2200
02:13:34,893 --> 02:13:36,053
I'll be right back!

2201
02:13:36,144 --> 02:13:38,647
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabob!

2202
02:13:44,569 --> 02:13:46,363
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

2203
02:13:46,863 --> 02:13:48,740
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2204
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:52,286
<i>Mommy.</i>

2205
02:13:52,369 --> 02:13:54,729
You're small and you're ugly.
No one's gonna see you coming.

2206
02:13:56,206 --> 02:13:57,791
Blow it up!

2207
02:14:04,172 --> 02:14:05,841
Infernocus,

2208
02:14:06,049 --> 02:14:08,468
transform. Kill them!

2209
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,934
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2210
02:14:16,226 --> 02:14:17,561
I got him!

2211
02:14:34,953 --> 02:14:37,164
Bee and Hot Rod
are down! Autobots down!

2212
02:14:37,247 --> 02:14:38,415
Where's Prime?

2213
02:14:38,498 --> 02:14:39,666
<i>Ay, chihuahua.</i>

2214
02:14:39,833 --> 02:14:41,686
<i>It's a no-go, General.
We're pinned down!</i>

2215
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:44,087
<i>Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff
didn't work, did it?</i>

2216
02:14:44,212 --> 02:14:46,423
<i>I got a Hail Mary. How about physics?</i>

2217
02:14:46,798 --> 02:14:48,067
Okay, I just did the simulation.

2218
02:14:48,091 --> 02:14:49,902
It's like if Tiger Woods
was making a big divot

2219
02:14:49,926 --> 02:14:50,969
with his nine-iron.

2220
02:14:51,053 --> 02:14:52,262
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2221
02:14:52,929 --> 02:14:55,199
<i>All right, there's a chunk right here
that's held up by thin vines.</i>

2222
02:14:55,223 --> 02:14:57,118
<i>You gotta blow up those vines,
use tactical nukes to blow out</i>

2223
02:14:57,142 --> 02:14:58,435
the vines and let it swing.

2224
02:14:58,602 --> 02:14:59,620
<i>Okay, you let gravity do the rest.</i>

2225
02:14:59,644 --> 02:15:00,854
<i>The chamber comes down,</i>

2226
02:15:01,021 --> 02:15:02,457
the energy transfer stops,
and the Earth is saved.

2227
02:15:02,481 --> 02:15:03,481
You're welcome.

2228
02:15:04,191 --> 02:15:06,068
I need tac-nuke authority.

2229
02:15:06,193 --> 02:15:08,588
<i>Lennox team,
we are pulling you out. Mission's over.</i>

2230
02:15:08,612 --> 02:15:10,405
<i>Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.</i>

2231
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,782
<i>Then I'm ordering you to bail.</i>

2232
02:15:11,865 --> 02:15:13,033
Roger that. Picture's up.

2233
02:15:13,492 --> 02:15:15,243
I see it, I see it.

2234
02:15:15,744 --> 02:15:18,580
We got a new target!
Three o'clock high!

2235
02:15:18,997 --> 02:15:21,458
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2236
02:15:21,625 --> 02:15:23,436
They're gonna bring
that whole thing down on us.

2237
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,479
Hey! We're not giving up
on Prime, okay?

2238
02:15:24,503 --> 02:15:25,504
He's gonna be here!

2239
02:15:25,796 --> 02:15:28,090
They just changed the whole plan.
We can't get inside.

2240
02:15:28,215 --> 02:15:30,050
- What?
- The operation is over.

2241
02:15:30,133 --> 02:15:31,134
We stay, we're dead.

2242
02:15:31,468 --> 02:15:32,612
I have to get in there!

2243
02:15:32,636 --> 02:15:34,388
Everybody, grab your chutes,
we're bailing!

2244
02:15:38,475 --> 02:15:39,810
<i>you.</i>

2245
02:15:47,484 --> 02:15:48,586
<i>Fight, fight, fight.</i>

2246
02:15:48,610 --> 02:15:49,730
<i>Fight's on.</i>

2247
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:57,452
Good job, little friend.

2248
02:15:57,661 --> 02:16:00,080
- Laze the target!
- Move, move, move!

2249
02:16:01,456 --> 02:16:02,456
Let's move!

2250
02:16:02,499 --> 02:16:05,168
Let's move out!
We got you covered! Move!

2251
02:16:10,215 --> 02:16:11,633
Optimus.

2252
02:16:14,344 --> 02:16:15,344
Yeah!

2253
02:16:34,364 --> 02:16:36,658
You ugly mess!

2254
02:16:40,036 --> 02:16:43,123
Did you forget who I am?

2255
02:16:53,842 --> 02:16:56,678
I am Optimus Prime.

2256
02:16:57,053 --> 02:16:59,723
Autobots, attack!

2257
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:09,232
Laze the target!

2258
02:17:10,108 --> 02:17:12,027
Laze it, laze it, laze it.

2259
02:17:12,498 --> 02:17:13,498
<i>Laser paint confirmed.</i>

2260
02:17:13,528 --> 02:17:14,374
<i>Laser paint confirmed on target.</i>

2261
02:17:14,404 --> 02:17:15,530
Come on!

2262
02:17:15,614 --> 02:17:17,094
<i>Silver arrows, fire.</i>

2263
02:17:17,532 --> 02:17:19,075
<i>Missiles away, missiles away.</i>

2264
02:17:19,284 --> 02:17:20,619
Go, go!

2265
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:23,079
Go!

2266
02:17:24,498 --> 02:17:27,000
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't think I can do this.

2267
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:29,210
Nine seconds.

2268
02:17:29,252 --> 02:17:30,253
We're going home, Izzy.

2269
02:17:32,714 --> 02:17:34,549
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> don't go!

2270
02:17:35,133 --> 02:17:36,510
Where is Viviane?

2271
02:17:36,593 --> 02:17:39,012
She's gone, boss.
They're all chickening out.

2272
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:41,449
What if you're wrong, Lennox?
What if it doesn't work?

2273
02:17:41,473 --> 02:17:42,473
It's gonna work!

2274
02:17:42,933 --> 02:17:44,643
Look, we're doing this together, okay?

2275
02:17:44,851 --> 02:17:47,312
- Here we go.
- Hit it, hit it, hit it...

2276
02:17:55,445 --> 02:17:58,532
We got to go! We're bailing.

2277
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:00,867
- What are you doing?
- It's just dusty old books.

2278
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:02,077
What?

2279
02:18:04,538 --> 02:18:05,789
Wait!

2280
02:18:05,956 --> 02:18:07,832
She's got to be kidding me. Shit!

2281
02:18:24,099 --> 02:18:26,309
Viviane! Get in here!

2282
02:18:26,643 --> 02:18:28,144
Yes! My little lady.

2283
02:18:42,576 --> 02:18:43,994
Aah! Wait!

2284
02:18:48,415 --> 02:18:49,916
Cade!

2285
02:18:57,257 --> 02:19:00,135
Command, be advised,
ignition chamber is tumbling.

2286
02:19:00,385 --> 02:19:02,554
I repeat, chamber is broke loose.
It is falling.

2287
02:19:12,397 --> 02:19:14,733
<i>The energy transfer is still continuing.</i>

2288
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,943
<i>T-minus 55 minutes and counting.</i>

2289
02:19:17,027 --> 02:19:18,445
I can't believe it didn't work.

2290
02:19:18,528 --> 02:19:19,755
<i>General, I'm in my chute.</i>

2291
02:19:19,779 --> 02:19:21,156
<i>The chamber is still arcing power.</i>

2292
02:19:21,281 --> 02:19:22,282
<i>I don't think it worked.</i>

2293
02:19:23,283 --> 02:19:24,326
- No!
- Hold on!

2294
02:19:41,718 --> 02:19:43,803
Follow me.
I'm gonna lead the way.

2295
02:19:48,266 --> 02:19:49,893
Okay, there it is.

2296
02:19:50,018 --> 02:19:52,187
Grab the staff, Viviane!

2297
02:19:52,562 --> 02:19:53,897
All right, go!

2298
02:20:06,368 --> 02:20:07,369
Watch out, watch out!

2299
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:13,708
Stop the time!

2300
02:20:13,917 --> 02:20:15,418
Gonna blow your head off, Megatron!

2301
02:20:16,252 --> 02:20:17,921
<i>Sayonara,</i> bubblehead!

2302
02:20:34,854 --> 02:20:36,564
Megatron, kill her!

2303
02:20:50,036 --> 02:20:52,288
We were brothers once.

2304
02:20:52,414 --> 02:20:53,498
Once.

2305
02:21:20,817 --> 02:21:23,153
Oh, we're going weightless.
Weightless!

2306
02:21:28,158 --> 02:21:29,826
- Grab my hand.
- Yes!

2307
02:21:40,086 --> 02:21:41,546
Don't let it go!

2308
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:50,096
Quintessa, get off our planet!

2309
02:21:50,847 --> 02:21:52,682
You traitor!

2310
02:21:55,852 --> 02:21:58,062
Say hello to my friend,

2311
02:21:58,730 --> 02:22:00,690
Bumblebee.

2312
02:22:06,613 --> 02:22:08,865
Sting like a bee.

2313
02:22:26,633 --> 02:22:28,259
I'll save you!

2314
02:22:34,390 --> 02:22:35,725
I stop the time.

2315
02:23:44,168 --> 02:23:46,004
Is it tomorrow yet?

2316
02:23:50,758 --> 02:23:53,261
<i>At the heart of every legend,</i>

2317
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:55,388
<i>there is truth.</i>

2318
02:23:57,307 --> 02:23:59,809
<i>A few brave souls unite</i>

2319
02:24:00,727 --> 02:24:02,812
<i>to save their worlds.</i>

2320
02:24:03,771 --> 02:24:06,232
<i>We can be heroes in our own lives,</i>

2321
02:24:07,984 --> 02:24:09,277
<i>every one of us,</i>

2322
02:24:09,652 --> 02:24:13,740
<i>if we only have the courage to try.</i>

2323
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:16,534
You saved Prime.

2324
02:24:17,827 --> 02:24:21,039
<i>Our fates
were always intertwined.</i>

2325
02:24:21,497 --> 02:24:26,002
<i>But now our worlds are joined as one.</i>

2326
02:24:26,794 --> 02:24:29,047
<i>We need to repair our planets.</i>

2327
02:24:29,923 --> 02:24:31,507
<i>Work together...</i>

2328
02:24:31,591 --> 02:24:34,218
<i>If we wish to survive.</i>

2329
02:24:35,303 --> 02:24:37,013
Crazy family, huh?

2330
02:24:39,182 --> 02:24:41,684
You did good, bro. Real good.

2331
02:24:44,228 --> 02:24:48,608
<i>A dangerous secret
is buried deep inside the Earth.</i>

2332
02:24:49,484 --> 02:24:53,529
<i>There is more to this planet
than meets the eye.</i>

2333
02:24:54,656 --> 02:24:56,950
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

2334
02:24:57,700 --> 02:25:00,203
<i>calling all Autobots.</i>

2335
02:25:01,204 --> 02:25:03,039
<i>It is time</i>

2336
02:25:03,748 --> 02:25:05,750
<i>to come home.</i>

2337
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:57,510
Are you lost?

2338
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:02,598
I wouldn't do that.

2339
02:26:03,474 --> 02:26:05,268
Don't touch him.

2340
02:26:06,436 --> 02:26:08,104
He doesn't like it.

2341
02:26:08,813 --> 02:26:10,440
Who doesn't like what?

2342
02:26:11,858 --> 02:26:13,443
Unicron.

2343
02:26:14,610 --> 02:26:16,779
But I could show
you how to kill him.

2344
