1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,293
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:04,390
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

3
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:05,703
You wanna be the new Breacher?

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,505
Your Thinking Cap and the dark matter

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,992
- is what caused this.
- I know!

6
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:11,156
How long before
everything I know is gone?

7
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,437
DeVoe has taken out everyone
who's gotten in his way.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,289
He created 12 meta-humans,
just so he could

9
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:16,468
steal their powers.

10
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,204
Why does he need their powers?

11
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:21,789
The fire that burns down Team Flash

12
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,421
will also light the path
to the Enlightenment.

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,786
Since the age of Enlightenment,

14
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,231
when reason, debate, and the
search for truth flourished,

15
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,800
the world has improved
by nearly every measure

16
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:36,069
in human advancement,
and continues to do so.

17
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,895
There is no doubt in my mind

18
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:40,807
that as technology continues to bloom,

19
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:42,575
so will all of humanity.

20
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:45,843
Professor DeVoe?

21
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,132
You disagree?

22
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:49,715
Well, uh, yes, I guess.

23
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:52,619
Just, I have a more realistic view

24
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,335
of humanity whenever
technology is concerned.

25
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:56,398
What do you mean?

26
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,857
Well, you spoke of the Enlightenment.

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,027
One only has to look at
history to find the answers.

28
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,429
Okay, let's.

29
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,998
Life expectancy over
the past two centuries

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,335
has increased from 30
years to nearly 70 years.

31
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:11,004
And-and we should assume
that's a good thing?

32
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,672
Each new day, we have to share

33
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,941
very limited resources
with anything up to

34
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,801
200,000 newborn babies,

35
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,656
most of whom will end up living

36
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,679
in abject poverty and famine.

37
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,750
Well, thank you very much,
Professor Doom and Gloom.

38
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,353
Remind me never to take
one of your history classes.

39
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:30,256
Perhaps you should. There's
much I could teach you.

40
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,539
The Taoists, in pursuit of immortality,

41
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,841
discovered gunpowder.

42
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:40,532
Alfred Nobel created the Nobel Prize

43
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:41,872
so he wouldn't be remembered

44
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,637
as the man who invented dynamite.

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,606
History has shown us time and time again

46
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,676
that whenever a
technological advancement

47
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,545
can be used to hurt
humanity, it will be.

48
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,114
You can't blame technology for the way

49
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:55,682
men choose to use it, Professor.

50
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:57,684
You can't ignore that the best of ideas

51
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,293
by the smartest of men often have a way

52
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:01,888
of becoming corrupted.

53
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:12,132
You've located everything we need.

54
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:14,234
And now the time has come to retrieve it

55
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,703
so we can finally...

56
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:18,638
enlighten the world.

57

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Uh-oh.

59
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,531
Hey, babe.

60
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,866
Uh, it's me. Just checking in.

61
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:48,334
For my dad.

62
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,904
He... really wants to know your answer

63
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:52,338
about taking the Breacher job.

64
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,239
I think his exact words were:

65
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,975
"That little son of a
Breach better tell me,

66
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,811
or they will never find the body."

67
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,179
Yeah. But you know what?

68
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,780
He's retired. He can wait.

69
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:02,648
So just take as much time as you need.

70
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,656
- Okay? It's, um...
- Don't say it's fine.

71
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,319
- You know.
- Don't say it's fine.

72
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,528
- It's fine.
- Oh, God.

73
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:08,851
- It's fine.
- Okay.

74
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,757
So, just five me. Whenever.

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,092
Okay. Bye.

76
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,762
Ramon, speed lab. Now.

77
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,356
Good! Good, good, good.

78
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,699
Good, good, good good, good.

79
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,301
Thing we're gonna do
to get Killer Frost

80
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,236
to appear, get that massive spike

81
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,338
in your adrenaline
production that we need,

82
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,195
is, Ramon is gonna use his vibes

83
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:28,851
to shake you up on the cellular level,

84
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,123
and let's see if we
can't get your old friend

85
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,145
Killer Frost to come out to play.

86
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:33,780
Are you sure this is gonna work?

87
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,248
Well, I mean, like any hypothesis,

88
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,583
you have to test it to get an answer.

89
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,817
It's what we've all done since

90
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,853
the fourth grade, known as the...

91
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,020
Scientific method?

92
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,710
Right you are, Allen!

93
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:44,582
Of course. Ah, here he is.

94
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:47,093
Okay, good. So get in position.

95
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,562
Don't worry, I lowered
the amps on this thing.

96
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,197
Ramon, you set?

97
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,465
Yeah.

98
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,700
Snow, you ready?

99
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,201
I'm ready.

100
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,904
Three, two, one, and...

101
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,187
Nothing.

102
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,710
All right. Ramon, more power.

103
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,814
Set? Three, two, one...

104
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,417
All right, this isn't working.

105
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,046
You know what, Ramon? Full power.

106
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,797
Wait, hold on, hold
on. What do you mean,

107
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,201
full power? We don't
want to blast Caitlin

108
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,132
across the speed lab.

109
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:18,758
Well, you need to get a
spike in her adrenaline.

110
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,438
- Harry, she could get injured.
- Yeah.

111
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,993
God, this is... Look, this is

112
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,629
gonna work, okay? Nothing has changed.

113
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,866
All right? Snow's DNA tests,

114
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,268
they confirm it. Her meta-DNA

115
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,869
was not spliced by Noah's powers.

116
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,538
You mean Melting Point's powers.

117
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,573
Right, that's what I said.
Melting Point's powers.

118
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,145
- No, you didn't.
- I did say that.

119
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,151
But, Harry,

120
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,836
there's no dark matter
in her system anyway.

121
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:39,157
We're just trying to
spike her heart rate.

122
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,328
What do you mean,
there's no dark matter?

123
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,016
Harry, you knew that.

124
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,250
We all did.

125
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,886
We did? We did. No, I know.

126
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,489
I just, I think I
just, you know, forget.

127
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,557
I forgot.

128
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,679
You forgot?

129
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:54,049
Harry, are you okay?

130
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,956
No. He's not.

131
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,536
Harry, you're...

132
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,156
Losing my intelligence? Yes.

133
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,348
The injection of dark
matter from the Thinking Cap

134
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,310
apparently overwhelmed my synapses.

135
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:14,447
Instead of making my
brain faster, it's...

136
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,949
slowing it down.

137
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,320
Why didn't you tell us this sooner?

138
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,723
How long until...

139
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,320
No way of knowing.

140
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:27,078
I mean, there are days
I can think clearly

141
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,847
and other days...

142
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,863
I... I can't.

143
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:36,402
The good news is, um,
from what I can see,

144
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,465
the regression seems to be reversible.

145
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,757
Okay, great.

146
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,197
I'll start working on it full-time.

147
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,343
No, you won't.

148
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,531
I did this to myself,

149
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,234
and I-I thought "Oh, you know what?

150
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,779
"Use that Thinking Cap, and then I can

151
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,216
outthink Devoe and then stop DeVoe."

152
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,518
I was wrong. Now here we are.

153
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,253
Okay, well, we're gonna fix this.

154
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:59,125
You and I both know
there's a ticking clock...

155
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,840
and I can't help anyone like this.

156
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,295
Yes, you can.

157
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,463
How?

158
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,004
Look, guys.

159
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,305
Ralph...

160
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,807
Caitlyn's powers, now this.

161
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,977
DeVoe knew how to break us apart, but...

162
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,846
I mean, we're all still here.

163
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,748
We're a family.

164
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,584
That's how we're gonna beat DeVoe.

165
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,687
All right, Allen.

166
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,888
All right.

167
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,195
Vandermeer Steel.

168
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,864
Smaller than I expected.

169
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,835
The first step to our Enlightenment

170
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,804
is as simple...

171
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:50,076
As opening a door.

172
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,640
Alloy 1771.

173
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:09,262
Now, the gallium antimonide
substrates within these

174
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:13,566
can harness power at 400% efficiency.

175
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,664
The precise amount, I calculated.

176
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,878
You can pick 'em up.

177
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,681
Freeze!

178
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,884
You should let us leave.

179
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,753
I can't do that.

180
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,021
Yes, you can.

181
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,891
How are you...

182
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,899
We have what we need.

183
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,003
I suppose we do.

184
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,608
Code Red! Code Red!

185
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,147
Clifford. This is unnecessary.

186
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,049
You knew there were gonna be casualties

187
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,951
when we began.

188
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,153
This is his own doing.

189
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,354
Yes, my love.

190
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:20,837
What are we dealing with?

191
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,675
First of all, we're trying to determine

192
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:23,696
what was in that vault.

193
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,365
Watch your step right here.

194
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:28,537
There was no drilling,
there was no lock picked.

195
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,783
And the only thing anybody would tell us

196
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,251
about what was in the vault was that

197
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,420
it was some sort of
secretive technology.

198
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:35,217
Also, security guard here

199
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,257
was a 24-year-old,
apparently shot himself.

200
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,116
Wait, a robbery and a suicide?

201
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,318
He was newly married.

202
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,642
Has an infant at home.

203
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,740
This is smelling like
some meta madness to me.

204
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,092
Who else can "Kilgore" a retinal scan

205
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,835
and "Dibny" a vault lock?

206
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:50,804
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go interview some people,

207
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:51,813
see what I can find out.

208
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,360
All right, Cisco and I will try
to figure out what DeVoe stole.

209
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:56,008
All right. I'll be over here.

210
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:58,474
Okay, so. Where should we start?

211
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:01,204
I'm thinking: if we can gain acc...

212
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,818
to their files...

213
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,821
Alloy 1771?

214
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,014
It's the only item missing
from the inventory files.

215
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,724
Or I can just... stand
here and look pretty.

216
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,194
Hey, know what you can do, actually?

217
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,290
You could vibe the gun.

218
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,592
The file didn't say what Alloy 1771 was.

219
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:18,795
So we need another way to learn

220
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:19,837
why DeVoe would want it.

221
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Uh, vibing and DeVoe
do not mix, remember?

222
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,536
Yeah, I know, man. But I mean,

223
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:24,904
what are we supposed to
do? It's the only way.

224
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,139
Barry, I don't really feel like

225
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,874
getting blasted into a wall right now.

226
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,176
I'm sure there's another way we can

227
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,478
find out what this is that doesn't

228
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,746
require me getting a migraine.

229
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:34,848
It is a solar panel.

230
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,549
Constructed of metal that absorbs

231
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:37,917
and multiplies the sun's energy

232
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,935
at 400% efficiency.

233
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,655
What would DeVoe be
doing with a solar panel?

234
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:43,868
Nothing, on its own.

235
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,313
He's gotta be building something.

236
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,926
Look, I-I need you to vibe the gun.

237
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,139
Maybe I should put this
in movie terms for you.

238
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:52,966
Everything in DeVoe's wake is
like the "Home Alone" house.

239
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,701
Okay? It's booby-trapped.

240
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,536
I would need to double my powers

241
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:58,599
just to even attempt to vibe the gun.

242
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,106
Well, hold on. I mean, could...

243
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,678
Could Gypsy double your powers?

244
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,670
- That's a good idea.
- No, not.

245
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,145
Not what?

246
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,412
Gypsy's busy.

247
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:07,847
Her dad just retired.

248
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,267
She's having to do double the work.

249
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,599
Earth 19 is a mess
right now. She's swamped.

250
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,619
Cisco.

251
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,354
Combining your powers could make it

252
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,256
so we know DeVoe's next move.

253
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,732
Thanks for meeting me.

254
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,529
- I need a favor.
- Okay.

255
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:26,399
I need you to distract
Cecile for a while.

256
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,634
What for?

257
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:28,802
Well, that's the thing.

258
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,470
I can't tell you, because if I do,

259
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,545
she'll read your mind and find out.

260
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,740
Why can't Iris do it?

261
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,141
Because Iris knows exactly why

262
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:36,873
I'm trying to distract Cecile.

263
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,623
- Ah.
- And therefore Barry knows.

264
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,580
Which means that Cisco knows, Kid knows.

265
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,240
- Whatever you need.
- Really?

266
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,514
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,385
You're welcome. All right.

268
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,115
Lose my mind, become a babysitter.

269
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:49,722
Oh, come on.

270
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:53,660
Listen, if anybody's gonna
reverse what's happening,

271
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,528
it's gonna be those
kids at S.T.A.R. Labs.

272
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,412
I mean, they love you, Harry.

273
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,266
And they will never
stop trying to help you.

274
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,569
- So don't lose hope.
- Right.

275
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:09,092
And that is how I aced
my intro to heat transfer

276
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,010
my first year at university.

277
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,278
Bravo.

278
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,580
Ducked and run.

279
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:16,649
I miss those days.

280
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,686
I was young and foolish and brave.

281
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:20,974
And now you're just foolish.

282
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,555
To agree to a date with someone

283
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,158
I first met as they were so rudely

284
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,128
disagreeing with my
professional opinion.

285
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,896
Foolish, maybe.

286
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,560
Yeah, no one's ever
challenged me like that.

287
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,907
It was refreshing.

288
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:42,008
Ah, maybe you are right

289
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,277
about technology's distracting us.

290
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,045
It certainly can destroy moments.

291
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,182
Although, sometimes...

292
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:50,750
technology...

293
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,785
can create them as well.

294
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,983
Thanks for coming to help us, Gypsy.

295
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,351
You two are up.

296
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,987
So, how do we do this?

297
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,618
Okay, so to co-vibe, we
have to be totally in sync.

298
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,073
All right? Our minds have to be on

299
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:34,342
exactly the same page.

300
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,728
Just like always.

301
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,163
Yeah.

302
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:46,998
Oh. So that was weird.

303
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,264
Why? What did you see?

304
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,676
I don't know, a-a dock?

305
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,744
Um, looked like a shipping container.

306
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:52,860
Number 16.

307
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,114
That must be what DeVoe
is gonna steal next.

308
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,050
He's gonna have to steal it from us.

309
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,556
All right.

310
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,259
It looks like we made it in time.

311
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,126
Whatever's in this container,
we can't let DeVoe have it.

312
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,929
Actually...

313
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:12,959
it's what's in... this container

314
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,235
you can't let me have.

315
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,237
Well...

316
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,938
what was in this container.

317
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,781
Hit him!

318
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:34,687
Gratitude...

319
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,808
for the workout, brief as it was.

320
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,425
Later.

321
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,267
Damn it. Damn it!

322
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,336
Why didn't we see the
right container number?

323
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:53,640
Someone's vibe wasn't
clear enough, Cisco.

324
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,009
Are you blaming me?

325
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,190
You lost your focus, what can I say?

326
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:00,283
Yeah, getting hit against
a metal container wall

327
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:01,451
sort of does that.

328
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,602
You know, I hit that wall too.
I'm perfectly focused.

329
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:04,852
Oh, well, if you're so focused,

330
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,033
then why'd you let him get away?

331
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,330
Don't even try and put that on me.

332
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,790
I'm sorry, I didn't put that on you.

333
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:09,767
You put that on you.

334
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,321
I'm gonna put my fist in your face,

335
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:13,088
- is what I'm gonna...
- Is that how we'd work together

336
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,188
if I took the job?

337
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:16,688
Guys. What job?

338
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,992
I brought that metal piece
from the shipping container,

339
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,109
in case we want to try
co-vibing later, but...

340
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:29,480
think we both saw
where that led us, so...

341
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:33,485
So you said... Breacher retired.

342
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:36,531
He offered you a job on Earth
19 to replace him, didn't he?

343
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:37,640
Mm-hmm.

344
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,176
You know, another shot in the dark,

345
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,060
but you haven't actually given Breacher

346
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,596
or Gypsy an answer yet.

347
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,798
Mm-mm.

348
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,523
Which way you leaning?

349
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,860
I wanna be with Gypsy
more than anything.

350
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,704
It's just complicated.

351
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,706
Hey, no, man, I get it.

352
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,213
But look, I mean...

353
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:58,022
maybe...

354
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,158
you guys working together to end this

355
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,861
will make the decision
easier, for both of you.

356
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,492
What if she doesn't want
the same thing as me?

357
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:07,532
I mean, you're never
gonna know unless you ask.

358
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:11,369
And listen, Cisco, I mean...

359
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,812
we can't beat DeVoe without you.

360
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,572
You're our secret weapon.

361
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,008
You and Gypsy just need to be

362
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,710
on the same page for
that weapon to work.

363
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,246
Yeah, and I don't know that we can be.

364
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:23,381
All right, well...

365
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,783
let me help you.

366
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:27,554
- Barry.
- No, I... hold on.

367
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,623
So that's gonna end well.

368
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,726
Last one.

369
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:38,530
Okay, we, uh, need food.

370
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:40,331
We need wine.

371
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,773
Lots of both. Go.

372
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,042
I'll unpack.

373
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,085
Clifford!

374
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,340
Go. Hurry home.

375
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:50,808
I can stay, if... You're sure?

376
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,443
- Yeah.
- I really should.

377
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:53,878
Last chance.

378
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:22,339
_

379
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:30,815
Me, hunter!

380
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,162
Me hunted feast for my queen!

381
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,655
You don't believe these things you wrote

382
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,724
in this journal, do you?

383
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,932
This reads like some
radical's manifesto, Clifford.

384
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,933
It is a realist's awakening.

385
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:53,004
You declare war against every
technological philanthropist.

386
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,573
Men, men, men.

387
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,609
Pushing us to the brink of Armageddon

388
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:59,077
with their "inventions."

389
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,713
No, they want a better mankind.

390
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,249
Don't be naive, Marlize.

391
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:08,820
The severity of our society's failings

392
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:12,824
require extreme ideas if ever we were to

393
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:16,193
restore some semblance of balance.

394
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:18,129
"Technology has become a cancerous cell

395
00:17:18,132 --> 00:17:19,798
in our social biology.

396
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:23,068
Exercising it... would
require a total purge,

397
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:24,826
not only of the material world,

398
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,472
but also human consciousness"?

399
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:30,241
This is not balance! This
is lobotomizing people!

400
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:33,344
It is rebooting the masses' brains,

401
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:35,909
to let them forget their
technological crutches!

402
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,782
They are babies with pacifiers!

403
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,350
Oh, and who will teach them?

404
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:40,685
You, Professor?

405
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,454
How does any of this help humankind?

406
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,639
Don't you see? Marlize...

407
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,528
Our technology is killing us.

408
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,732
You and I, we can fix this.

409
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,236
Together.

410
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,968
As partners.

411
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,338
We can lead them, all
of society, humanity,

412
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,475
on the true path to Enlightenment.

413
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,849
Hey, Harry.

414
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:14,018
DA Cecile Horton.

415
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,822
Joe said you needed to adjust
my mental activity dampener.

416
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,404
Yes. Joe... yes.

417
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:22,559
I have to do that. It's,
uh, it's not a big deal.

418
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:25,209
It's a standard procedure.

419
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,751
That's, yeah. Okay.

420
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:32,053
All right. I'm in.

421
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:35,105
Well, it's installing, so...

422
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:39,143
now you just... you just sit.

423
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,244
And wait.

424
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,213
For a long time.

425
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,293
Okay. What is happening

426
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,830
with your thoughts right now?

427
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,357
With my... okay.

428
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,128
So... there was an
incident with dark matter...

429
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:56,959
Yeah, I know, I know,
Joe told me about that.

430
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:59,007
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What do you mean?

431
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:01,912
Your thoughts are screaming at me.

432
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,948
It's like they start to form,

433
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,636
and then, it's like,

434
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,959
the more the ideas appear...

435
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:10,141
- The more they disappear.
- Exactly.

436
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,610
Well, that explains my "can't" days.

437
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,779
What does that mean, Harry?

438
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:18,750
It means, DA Cecile Horton,

439
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:21,953
that the more I try to use my brain...

440
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:24,188
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

441
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:28,726
Barista. Another one, please.

442
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:30,361
Uh, make it a double.

443
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,196
Thank you.

444
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:34,165
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

445
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,534
I've been looking everywhere for you.

446
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,818
Can't a woman caffeinate in peace

447
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,254
around here?

448
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,324
Hey. Look. Hey!

449
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,708
I know why you're upset,
but it's all right.

450
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:45,873
- Really?
- Yeah.

451
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:48,284
Look, Cisco just thinks
if he takes the job,

452
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,081
he'll be letting us down. But, I mean,

453
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,749
he just needs to follow his own heart,

454
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,317
do what he needs to
do, not worry about us.

455
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,219
He knows that.

456
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:58,656
Wow. That's actually really great.

457
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,495
So now... all you guys have to do

458
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,709
is talk to each other.

459
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,646
Yeah. Well, that part's
not so easy, so...

460
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,771
Yes... it is.

461
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,875
- What are you doing?
- What?

462
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:10,644
Don't even think about. No!

463
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,060
Okay.

464
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:13,763
Don't ever "whoosh" me again, all right?

465
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,498
Totally, I'm sorry. Um, Cisco.

466
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,037
What is going on?

467
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,249
Just getting 'em back
on the same page, okay?

468
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,288
Cisco, Gypsy is upset, because, frankly?

469
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,735
I mean, it's taking
you too long to accept

470
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:24,962
Breacher's job offer. Duh. And Gypsy.

471
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:28,086
Cisco, he's-he's just worried
about abandoning his team.

472
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,977
I mean, it's not that
he doesn't want the job.

473
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,714
Right? Okay, so...

474
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:35,216
Now you both know, right?

475
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,394
And you can dive in and...

476
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,397
work this out... Let's talk about this.

477
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:47,305
CCPD is reporting two more break-ins

478
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,140
at tech manufacturers... Boeing Lab

479
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,241
and the Jamison Institute.

480
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:51,442
More hardware was stolen.

481
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:53,000
- DeVoe.
- Was anybody hurt?

482
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,855
Three fatalities, all
of them security guards

483
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,046
in high-level clearance
areas, just like at Vandermeer.

484
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,406
He's taking whatever he wants,
killing anybody that gets in the way.

485
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,742
Guys, I-I'm sorry, but
we have to figure out

486
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:06,257
what kind of machine
he's building, right now.

487
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,892
Look, we have to try.

488
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,302
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,013
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- I saw that one coming.

490
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,594
- You okay?
- I'm good. Thank you.

491
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,035
They okay?

492
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,292
Tests show, physically, they're fine.

493
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,796
As a couple, not so much.

494
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,615
Where are you going?

495
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,118
I need to get these two back in sync.

496
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:46,836
I mean, we gotta get
ahead of this somehow.

497
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,573
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, cowboy.

498
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:49,732
What do you mean? Why?

499
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:52,502
Maybe you've done enough already, okay?

500
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:55,043
Cisco and Gypsy are
clearly going through

501
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,914
something, and, you
know, it's not up to us

502
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,148
to counsel them through it.

503
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,233
Well, then who is it up to, Iris?

504
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,318
- Just stop for a second...
- We can't stop.

505
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
The second we do,
everyone could fall apart.

506
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,089
The team's hanging on by a thread.

507
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,157
- But we are hanging on, Barry.
- For how long?

508
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,659
I mean, look at what's happening.

509
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,461
DeVoe is killing innocent people.

510
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,198
He's stealing pieces of
tech, for God knows why.

511
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Just trying to keep up with
him is tearing us apart.

512
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,069
Babe... you can't put it on yourself

513
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,438
to hold everyone together.

514
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:31,147
Cisco is family.

515
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,698
And when family hurts, we all hurt.

516
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:35,018
I get that.

517
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,573
But sometimes you can't answer
their questions for them.

518
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:38,888
Sometimes, you just have to support them

519
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,355
while they find them on their own,

520
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,091
whether they're together
or they're apart.

521
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,463
What?

522
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,365
That's it.

523
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,168
The pieces of tech don't fit together...

524
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,571
because they're not supposed to.

525
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,206
He's not building one thing,
he's building multiple.

526
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,415
Harry, I know this is hard.

527
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,817
Well...

528
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,377
it is hard, DA Cecile
Horton, because my brain,

529
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,496
the one thing that has defined me

530
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:13,890
for, well, pretty much my entire life,

531
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,091
is about to...

532
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,362
vanish, and then who will I be?

533
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,963
You'll be the exact same
man you've always been.

534
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,900
Yeah, but dumb.

535
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,036
Same man. Way less intelligent.

536
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,571
Harry.

537
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,174
There are lots of
ways to be intelligent.

538
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,109
Not just using your head.

539
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,012
Right.

540
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,054
Wait.

541
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,223
Do that again. Harry!

542
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,192
- Do what?
- Do it again! Do it again!

543
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,979
Right?

544
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,448
- How did you do that?
- I saw it!

545
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:59,635
Inside your mind, before it vanished.

546
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,615
In... wait. So you can...

547
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,017
Write down what you're thinking.

548
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,653
- Before it...
- Disappears.

549
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:07,275
- Wow.
- Yeah.

550
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,913
Marlize? I brought the sample.

551
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:14,317
- Hey.
- Hey!

552
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,019
Okay.

553
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,055
All right.

554
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,226
- Fingers crossed.
- Yep.

555
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,521
Here we go.

556
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,735
Cheers.

557
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,173
- Yes!
- Yeah?

558
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,442
- Show the others.
- Got it.

559
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,151
Hello?

560
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,552
Marlize.

561
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,920
It's me.

562
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,791
Clifford.

563
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,160
I need you to come home.

564
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,095
I can't.

565
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,260
I'm making a difference
here... I'm changing lives

566
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:03,399
for the better. These people need me.

567
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,734
I need you.

568
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,971
I'm sorry.

569
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,627
I can't be with someone that thinks

570
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,041
that society is a disease, that believes

571
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,446
that our world is being
plagued by technology.

572
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,614
I am nothing without you.

573
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,126
You're a brilliant man

574
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,729
with a great future ahead of you.

575
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,453
What kind of future do I have

576
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,388
if you are not by my side?

577
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,948
I just wish that you could show

578
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,093
the same compassion
for the rest of humanity

579
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,961
as you do for me.

580
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,832
Listen to me, Marlize, I...

581
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,151
my thoughts, I cannot...

582
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:41,529
I-I just... I just don't think that...

583
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,578
Marlize?

584
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:50,877
Marlize?

585
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,427
Marlize!

586
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,091
So... what were you gonna say?

587
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,894
Before we were so
alarmingly interrupted.

588
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,533
Look, I just...

589
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,198
Cisco, I...

590
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,473
Don't want you to take the job.

591
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,509
Oh.

592
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,710
That is such a relief.

593
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:26,581
Because I don't want anything to change.

594
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,194
Not only have we not
been on the same page,

595
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,429
we haven't even been on the same planet.

596
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,265
Literally.

597
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,433
We've been doing this
back-and-forth thing

598
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,662
for almost a year,

599
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:47,737
negotiating who gets
to go to whose Earth

600
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,162
and when, just to see each other,

601
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,307
and on the off-chance we
do get to see each other,

602
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,143
there's, like, a countdown
until one of us has to leave,

603
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,748
and I'm tired of it!

604
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:58,498
I don't want to have to
Breach to see the woman I love.

605
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,916
I want to wake up next to her.

606
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,152
Every morning.

607
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,495
So what are you saying?

608
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,758
I'm saying I want more.

609
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,944
I'm saying I don't want Breacher's job,

610
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:12,245
but I do want you.

611
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:13,896
I want you too.

612
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,565
What am I supposed to do?

613
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,700
Pack up my entire life, everything?

614
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,495
Forget about my job,
my responsibilities...

615
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:20,826
- No, no, no...
- Move here?

616
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,638
No, no, that's not what
I'm asking you to do.

617
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,424
I would never ask you
to leave the Agency.

618
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:27,210
I know how important that is to you.

619
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,511
But tell me,

620
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,847
and tell me honestly...

621
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,815
this, what we have...

622
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,818
Is this enough for you?

623
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,257
Yes.

624
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,860
It is.

625
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,432
Well, it isn't for me.

626
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,599
Hey, guys? I need you both in the Cortex.

627
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,973
- Why?
- I know what DeVoe's doing.

628
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,407
It's not one machine.

629
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,343
They're machines. Machines
that work together,

630
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,560
but they're still separate.

631
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:03,096
Satellites.

632
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,046
Separate satellites working together

633
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,983
for a single purpose?

634
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,807
So this guy really is a Bond villain.

635
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,152
DeVoe would need a massive amount

636
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,787
of computational power
for them to be able

637
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:12,919
to talk to each other.

638
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,556
Something to triangulate navigation

639
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,725
between each satellite.

640
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,527
So, like, a quantum computer?

641
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,768
Mercury Labs just put a whole system

642
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:22,713
of quantum computers
online, at their home base.

643
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:23,857
That's where he's going.

644
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,234
Okay, great. This time,
we catch DeVoe by surprise.

645
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,576
Behold.

646
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,044
The key to communicating

647
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,313
our message of the Enlightenment.

648
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,350
Polynomial time computing.

649
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,788
And a dream shall
soon become... reality.

650
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:15,164
Clifford!

651
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,267
Uh-uh. Don't move.

652
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,869
Barry! Knock him out, and then cuff him!

653
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,037
On it!

654
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,267
Gypsy, now!

655
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,396
Stop it, you're killing him!

656
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,919
Cisco, look out!

657
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,600
Barry, hit him again!

658
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,467
Enough!

659
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,030
Caitlin.

660
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,447
Caitlin, what the hell are you doing?

661
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,850
Bringing her back.

662
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,149
DeVoe is creating a sonic pulse.

663
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,006
You need to get out of there before...

664
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:19,428
Oh, I get it. You'd
like me to frighten you

665
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,717
into becoming your better half.

666
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,181
Gladly.

667
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:26,975
- DeVoe!
- Ugh.

668
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,906
Children should be seen, not heard.

669
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:33,276
I'm very sure seeing your bestie die

670
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:34,451
would be frightening enough,

671
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:36,588
but I can't kill the Flash.

672
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:38,162
Well, not just yet.

673
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:40,482
My plan for the Enlightenment

674
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:42,518
requires his further participation.

675
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,389
You, however... are
a lot less fortunate.

676
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,757
Barry, he's gonna kill Gypsy!

677
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:53,729
Now, do you feel that?

678
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,231
Around your throat?

679
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:57,600
That is the gravitational equivalent

680
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:00,670
of my boot busting your windpipe.

681
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:04,106
She's innocent. Leave her alone!

682
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:05,408
Clifford...

683
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,712
This isn't part of our plan.

684
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,547
Cisco, wake up! Wake up!

685
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,051
Our plan is to save them.

686
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:17,147
Well, you can't save everyone, my love.

687
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:19,388
DeVoe!

688
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,224
Perhaps.

689
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:24,230
But I won't watch you kill
an innocent life again.

690
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,873
Yes, you will.

691
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,143
Please. Clifford.

692
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,413
Remember who you are.

693
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,617
Is this truly the lesson
you wish to bestow today?

694
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,502
Get the case.

695
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,350
Cynthia!

696
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:24,405
What happened? Come on, it's okay.

697
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,688
What did he do to her?

698
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:29,280
Hey, talk to me. Come on, it's okay.

699
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,826
You're okay. You're okay.

700
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:50,105
No thefts have been reported
in the last 12 hours.

701
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,792
So DeVoe managed to get
everything he needed.

702
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:56,062
And we still don't know
what his next step is.

703
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:00,500
You know, he said something
about the Enlightenment.

704
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:02,441
The hell's that supposed to mean?

705
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:04,170
I know what he's thinking.

706
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,593
I know what he's planning.

707
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:06,863
We know what he's planning.

708
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:08,449
- Harry, wait.
- What?

709
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,093
I can give them the CliffsNotes version.

710
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:10,968
No, no.

711
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:14,105
The component parts stolen
to create each satellite

712
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:17,355
will possess a 30...
cubit quantum system, okay,

713
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:20,119
and each system... is c-capable of...

714
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,722
Each system is capable of redirecting

715
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,390
concentrated dark matter back to Earth

716
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,207
in 10-million-megawatt bursts.

717
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,693
Which... Level of which

718
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:28,961
is toxic enough to affect

719
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,764
each and every human brain on the planet

720
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,816
and reboot them back to a...

721
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,334
Reboot them.

722
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:37,537
Back to a simplified state.

723
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:40,306
Just like mine.

724
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:42,189
DeVoe wants to remove the intelligence

725
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,324
of everyone on Earth?

726
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:44,677
Yes.

727
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:47,513
Exactly, Barry. Exactly right.

728
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,310
I'm really gonna do this.

729
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:19,946
You treat me...

730
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:22,215
like I am the only
woman in the multiverse,

731
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:24,617
and I want more.

732
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,085
What is wrong with me?

733
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:29,455
I don't know what's wrong with me.

734
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,794
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:35,895
Nothing's wrong.

736
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:39,232
Nothing at all.

737
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,793
I guess mayby sometimes,

738
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:51,177
one plus one just equals two, you know?

739
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,179
What are you gonna do?

740
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:15,568
Wait.

741
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:41,427
Good-bye, Cynthia.

742
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,162
Bye, Cisco.

743
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,347
Surprise!

744
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,699
What is this?

745
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,613
It's your baby shower, baby!

746
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:06,804
This is why you were singing

747
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,859
"The Girl From Ipanema"
in your head all day.

748
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,405
He has been planning this for days.

749
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,724
Oh, this is so sweet!

750
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,668
I feel really guilty
pulling everybody away

751
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,780
at a time like this, but...

752
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:16,801
It's the perfect time to celebrate.

753
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,108
Surrounded by family.

754
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:19,421
You guys!

755
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:22,358
This baby is gonna be so loved.

756
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:24,161
Aww.

757
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:28,274
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

758
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,048
Why don't you go talk to him?

759
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:45,591
Hey, man. Are you okay?

760
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,862
Not really, no.

761
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:53,666
Do you want some space, or...

762
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:56,202
Actually, I got plenty
of that right now.

763
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,344
I'm sorry for pushing the two of you.

764
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:10,182
I think you both did
the right thing, though.

765
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:16,155
Then why does it hurt so much?

766
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,256
Caitlin.

767
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:28,669
Look, I don't think you
should do that again.

768
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,504
You could have gotten yourself killed.

769
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:34,607
- I have to get her back.
- We will.

770
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:37,543
No. I will.

771
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,537
Clifford.

772
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,949
Clifford.

773
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:46,952
Ow! It's fine.

774
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:49,255
It's fine.

775
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,629
When the line cut out, I came.

776
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:58,197
Immediately.

777
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:03,803
I thought I'd lost you.

778
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:07,006
You'll never lose me, Clifford.

779
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,208
You were right.

780
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,237
Technology has become a cancer.

781
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,781
Driving civilization to consume itself.

782
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,917
A militia group found out
about the water purifier

783
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,519
that I created.

784
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:26,258
And they just killed dozens
of-of people to take it.

785
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:30,062
Women and children slaughtered.

786
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:32,765
For a simple piece of technology.

787
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,738
Your journal.

788
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,373
Wrote of a world where humanity forgot

789
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:45,978
that this technological
menace was capable.

790
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,667
But what I didn't tell you...

791
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:53,085
was that I saw the
truth in it even then.

792
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,687
And it frightened me.

793
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:59,692
And that's why I ran.

794
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:05,030
And I'm not frightened anymore.

795
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:06,365
You believe.

796
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,267
I believe in you.

797
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,438
Enlighten them, Clifford.

798
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,141
You're the only one who can.

799
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:23,282
I'm nothing without you.

800
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:41,901
The chair will rejuvenate
your fractured scaphoid.

801
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:44,136
Prepare the satellites for assembly.

802
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:51,610
I said, prepare the...

803
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:53,345
No!

804
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:58,818
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

805
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,353
Now you want to rule it.

806
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,824
I am leaving you, Clifford.

807
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:13,899
Nothing can get in or out.

808
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,635
You dare orchestrate an exodus

809
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:19,772
on the eve of humanity's
greatest reckoning?

810
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:21,674
You made a vow.

811
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:23,008
To my husband!

812
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,713
But my husband is dead.

813
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,549
The Thinker's first victim.

814
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:35,020
The Enlightenment will
come for you too, Marlize.

815
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:37,523
I will be all that remains.

816
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:41,060
Oh, Clifford.

817
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,229
You are nothing without me.

818
00:40:57,677 --> 00:40:59,377
Special delivery!

819
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,662
Wow! You're super pregnant!

820
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:04,549
Looks like you're due about
21 days from tonight, I'd say.

821
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:05,918
I-I mean, if I were guessing.

822
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,037
Sweetheart, who is it?

823
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,685
Uh, someone sent us a diaper bag.

824
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:12,156
It looks like it's a gift from someone

825
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,198
who wanted you both to
know how special you are.

826
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,635
Someone who understands
that time is precious

827
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:19,031
and right now is all we've got.

828
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,634
- Aww.
- Relatively speaking.

829
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,713
- Dad?
- Hey, look what we got.

830
00:41:23,716 --> 00:41:26,344
Oh! Who sent that? Wally?

831
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,213
Wally already sent us a bassinet,

832
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:31,810
which apparently was owned by Moses.

833
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,212
Was there a note?

834
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,582
Who was it?

835
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,284
Some delivery girl.

836
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:50,550
