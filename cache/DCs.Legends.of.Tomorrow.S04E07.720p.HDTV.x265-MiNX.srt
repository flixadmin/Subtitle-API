1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,728
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,178
An unknown number of other
dangerous magical beings

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,738
got spat out across the timeline
and now must be sent to hell.

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,684
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

5
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:13,004
- No!
- Is that a Kaupe?

6
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:14,188
This is a prison, Mona.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,332
And they are our prisoners.

8
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:16,445
Not our friends.

9
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,218
People around me get hurt, killed,

10
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,608
or far, far worse.

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,738
But you can't mess with your past.

12
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,370
Dez.

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,760
Order up.

14
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,868
Next one.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,888
Oi, oi!

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,888
Wake up, John-O.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,453
Piss off, will you?

18
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:06,186
Oh, not today, you lying geezer!

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,231
What the...

20
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,179
Now, you said that

21
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,257
my shapeshifting days were over.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,762
You call that abomination
shapeshifting, do you?

23
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,118
Well, if I can shift at all,

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,928
that means that your
spell is reversible.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,168
You see, that's where
you're wrong, sweetheart.

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,508
There's no taking it back.

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,838
Smart man like you, John-O,

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,128
you can figure it out.

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,628
Yeah, well...

30
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,848
mortal life is full of disappointments.

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,480
Best get used to it, love.

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,778
It's all right.

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,278
That's all right.

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,860
You know how I survived
in the prison dimension?

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,228
Trading favors.

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,978
Now, sooner or later,

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,268
you're gonna need something from me.

38
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,410
Then we'll talk, chum.

39
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,487
Thanks for staying at my place this time.

40
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,128
Oh, I love sleeping next to you.

41
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,658
I just wish that your place didn't mean

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,548
sharing a bathroom with...

43
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,828
Beer.

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,958
- Yes, Garima.
- Beer.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,498
It's the only word Rory taught her.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,998
Wait, Rory's still using Brigid's diary?

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,888
That thing is an
ancient magical artifact.

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,718
Yeah, but it keeps him happy.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,928
Sara, be reasonable.

50
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,735
You can't let Rory keep the diary.

51
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,338
I see you've met Garima.

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,871
What she lacks in vocabulary

53
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:24,782
she makes up for in personality.

54
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,098
And everyone knows that a happy Mick

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,660
is better for the entire ship.

56
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:30,946
Whoa.

57
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,568
Oh.

58
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,818
Killer 'stache.

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,004
- Interesting.
- You think?

60
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,845
I had Gideon stimulate my hair follicles

61
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,016
to grow it overnight.

62
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,158
I read in one of Nora's letters

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,198
that she had a thing
for mustaches, so I...

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,134
Sorry, but how are
we all being so blasé

65
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:46,449
about the diary?

66
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:49,399
What if Rory goes from
writing sci-fi to horror?

67
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,078
Do you want killer clowns
running around the ship?

68
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,378
The only killer on this ship

69
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,538
is the amount of sugar in this cereal.

70
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,358
"Big Easy-O's"?

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,008
They taste like beignets.

72
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,268
So sweet it makes your lips pucker.

73
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,598
- Oh!
- There's a quiz on the back.

74
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,108
Who is the most prolific serial killer

75
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,678
- in the United States?
- Ted Bundy.

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,058
Although in my opinion John Wayne Gacy

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,080
had way more victims than he confessed.

78
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,367
What?

79
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,949
Everyone has their hobbies.

80
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,857
Well, sorry, Ava, but according to

81
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,198
this not-so-kid-friendly cereal,

82
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,028
is answer is New
Orleans' own Marie Laveau.

83
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,130
What?

84
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,121
A high-profile female serial killer?

85
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,368
No, I would have heard of her.

86
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,418
The box is wrong.

87
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,958
Unless...

88
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,141
Gideon?

89
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:36,638
You are correct, Captain.

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,968
It appears a Fugitive is on the loose

91
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,898
in New Orleans in 1856.

92
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,108
According to local lore,

93
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,338
there were a series of murders

94
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,548
perpetrated by a criminal

95
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,879
who could walk through walls.

96
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,308
Sounds like we're going mindhunting

97
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,308
in the Big Easy.

98
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,059
Gideon, plot a course.

99
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:57,080

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,510
Ah...

101
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,658
Ow...

102
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:15,281
Ugh.

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,588
Unbelievable.

104
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,628
You just ran into my car, earmuffs.

105
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,699
But your car...

106
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,561
This scratch will easily
cost you a couple hundos.

107
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,177
You want me to pay for it?

108
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,350
Yes.

109
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,448
No worries, sir.

110
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,948
I can have the money tomorrow.

111
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,188
They really need to stop

112
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,830
giving delivery girls drive-ons.

113
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,368
I'm actually Assistant Coordinator

114
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,285
of Creature Upkeep.

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,478
Ahoy, matey.

116
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,892
It seem to be pirate day
once again, ya scurvy wench.

117
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,996
- Argh.
- Argh.

118
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,987
Don't be late again or Ava will give you

119
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,888
another peg leg.

120
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,488
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,848
Okay.

122
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,968
Hey, Catch-a-Predator, what was that?

123
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,996
Well, that, my fellow rebound artist,

124
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,431
- was flirting.
- Oh, Gary.

125
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:18,602
That was not flirting.

126
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,688
- No.
- What do you mean?

127
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,989
I mean, I made extended eye contact,

128
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,408
picked up on some personal information,

129
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,078
and then I negged her.

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,498
All right, don't tell me
you're falling for this, like,

131
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,988
Neanderthal misogynistic dating advice.

132
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,934
You're a modern man
surfing the sexual spectrum.

133
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:33,657
Just be cool and ask her out.

134
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,998
Or, and I'm just spitballing here,

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,328
you can ask her out for me.

136
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,850
This isn't high school.

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,858
Oh, sorry.

138
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,188
High school's a bit of
a trigger word for me.

139
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,528
Wow. You are really broken.

140
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,938
Okay, look, I will...

141
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,558
I'm not gonna ask her out.

142
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,870
But I will do some recon.

143
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,038
You'll be my time-bro wingman?

144
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,332
See, you do things like that,

145
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,713
and it makes it very
hard to help you, Gary.

146
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,117
All right, Legends.

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,059
Next stop, "N'awlins."

148
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:10,368
We have a Fugitive serial
killer, and it's a weird one.

149
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,958
Yeah, it says here
that all of the victims

150
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,538
were wealthy blonde ladies

151
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,138
stabbed to death inside
their locked bedrooms.

152
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,090
Spooky.

153
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,101
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

154
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,832
Blondes killed in locked rooms.

155
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,503
That's the MO of Mike the Spike.

156
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,563
Am I gonna find a murder
board in your closet?

157
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,066
New Orleans is a crap town.

158
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,047
Although anything's better
than that tush tickler.

159
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,126
This?

160
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,048
Well, the cops pinned it

161
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,178
on voodoo priestess Marie Laveau,

162
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,318
one of the only women of color
with power living in 1856.

163
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,468
Surprise, surprise.

164
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,228
You stole my diary, weasel.

165
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,368
Oh, you mean the one that
you nicked from my trunk?

166
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,434
That one, eh?

167
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,255
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, gentlemen.

168
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:45,090
I "mustache" you both to calm down.

169
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,451
Get out of my way,

170
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:47,913
otherwise I'll knock that fur ball

171
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:48,884
off your lip.

172
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,145
I confiscated the diary.

173
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,454
It's Time Bureau property now.

174
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:52,730
Don't worry, Rory.

175
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,618
Garima will always be
right where she belongs.

176
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,578
In your imagination.

177
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,559
Garima...

178
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:01,251
Rory, look. I'm sorry.

179
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,837
Ava was just doing her job,

180
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,418
which is exactly what
the rest of us need to do.

181
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,938
Ray, Mick, we're gonna protect

182
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,428
the Fugitive's first victim,

183
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,879
Miss Didi Charbonnet.

184
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,665
She's hosting a party this afternoon.

185
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,340
John, I need you to talk to Laveau.

186
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:16,778
Find out how she's mixed up in all this.

187
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,618
I'll go with him. Yeah.

188
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,188
I love me some voodoo.

189
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,332
- Great.
- Zari, you're on their mission.

190
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:23,965
You can just say the B-team.

191
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,787
No, there's no...

192
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,538
There's no such thing as B-team.

193
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,948
But there is such thing as an A-team.

194
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,498
Laissez les bons temps rouler!

195
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,998
Belles calas, toutes chaudes!

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,074
Wow, this doesn't
even look like America.

197
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:48,168
Oh, it's not.

198
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,508
This is New Orleans, baby.

199
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,128
You've been here before?

200
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,558
After London, best city in the world.

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,318
I mean, just look at this
hodgepodge of humanity.

202
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,898
It's the perfect place to pick a face

203
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,280
and just have some fun.

204
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,358
John?

205
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,668
You okay?

206
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,918
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, uh...

207
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,868
This city just brings
back memories, is all.

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,598
Monsieur Constantine.

209
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,218
Would you come with me, please?

210
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,217
Yeah, I'm not really in the habit

211
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,778
of going home with strangers, mate.

212
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,965
At least not recently.

213
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,250
Ugh. Not again.

214
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,238
Oh, what...

215
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,748
Oh, no.

216
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,368
This is not good.

217
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,058
Bloody New Orleans!

218
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,888
Ah, Priestess Laveau.

219
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,043
Oh, cheers, love.

220
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,978
You saved me the trouble of finding you.

221
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,818
That was a little bit theatrical,

222
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,408
to be honest with you, but then again,

223
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,938
I do appreciate a flair for the dramatic.

224
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,990
Arretez.

225
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,168
You have something of mine.

226
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,328
Oh, I have no idea what you're on about.

227
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,760
I felt its presence as soon
as you arrived in New Orleans.

228
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:44,167
This medallion honors Saint Marron,

229
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,928
the patron saint of runaway slaves.

230
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,980
Now, what do you know
about bondage, mon cher?

231
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,637
Buy me a pint at the local pub,

232
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,257
and I'll tell you all about it, love.

233
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,098
You don't have to say a thing.

234
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,754
I am back, and it is time

235
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,787
for me to cook you breakfast.

236
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,118
One full English coming up.

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,458
Hey, Johnny.

238
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,458
Dez, you, uh...

239
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,038
you have to leave town.

240
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,488
This thing that's after me,

241
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,324
it's no ordinary demon.

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,149
This medallion has been in
my family for generations.

243
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,828
It's imbued with a protection spell.

244
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,668
Take it, Johnny.

245
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,128
As long as you promise

246
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,058
to leave town.

247
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,228
It's just until I get this
mess sorted out, all right?

248
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,320
- All right.
- All right.

249
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,808
My great-great-grandson.

250
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,750
He must have loved you
to give you my medallion.

251
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,130
Did you love him?

252
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:06,828
Does anyone have eyes on
the Fugitive's first victim?

253
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,178
Annoying blonde in the middle.

254
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,688
That's Didi Charbonnet.

255
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,758
Good. Stay with her.

256
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,188
According to Gideon, the murder

257
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,688
is going to happen within the hour.

258
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,528
What kind of Fugitive stabs a woman?

259
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,198
I know a woman I could stab.

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,888
Rhymes with Shava.

261
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,368
Rory, play nice.

262
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,888
Don't worry, I can handle myself

263
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,278
against the cretin.

264
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,558
Whatever, man-pants.

265
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,038
Hey.

266
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,783
Look, I know you're
mad at Ava right now,

267
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,778
but she's right.

268
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,898
The diary is not a toy.

269
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,568
Garima helped me write.

270
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,878
Would you just try to
be nice to her, please?

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,300
For me?

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,260
Guys, keep an eye on the
creepy ginger by the door.

273
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,128
Copy that.

274
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,558
We have a possible Fugitive alert.

275
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,428
Gideon, we can't find
John, and he's not on comms.

276
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,308
Mr. Constantine
has refused to wear

277
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,888
his communications device.

278
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,051
Stupid blighter.

279
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:06,486
However, Captain Lance requested

280
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,731
I fabricate a tracker

281
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,364
in every pair of his undershorts.

282
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,611
That cheeky little minx.

283
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:11,700
Okay, great.

284
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:14,453
As soon as you trace
him, send us his location.

285
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,777
Tell me what happened to my Desmond.

286
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,778
A demon.

287
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,588
Neron.

288
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,008
Dez was collateral damage.

289
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,578
Just go ahead and curse me, all right?

290
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,338
'Cause I bloody deserve it.

291
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,788
Why would I curse the man

292
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,338
who could save the last of my line?

293
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,998
You don't understand.

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,628
Dez is gone.

295
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,561
No amount of magic can bring him back.

296
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,857
Save my kin.

297
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:45,138
Let him go!

298
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,188
Hey, hey, that's a nice rescue, loves,

299
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,098
but, uh, Priestess Laveau and I

300
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,182
were just, uh, just having
a little chat, weren't we?

301
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,478
Now to our business.

302
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,458
Have you sensed any
other magic in your city

303
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,146
besides my own and theirs?

304
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:00,507
I've sensed a spirit. A Dybbuk.

305
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,608
And, like you, from another time.

306
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,238
What's a Dybbuk?

307
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,158
It's the dislocated
soul of a dead person.

308
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
Someone so wicked that their
spirit never crossed over.

309
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,458
Sara? I don't think he's a Fugitive.

310
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,718
I think this guy's just
looking for the bathroom.

311
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,148
What's going on?

312
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,338
This doll...

313
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,750
is going to kill my mama.

314
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,368
This doll?

315
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,678
Sara, is it possible

316
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,870
that our Fugitive killer
is a possessed doll?

317
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,018
Horror movie 101.

318
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,048
Well, hello, dolly.

319
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,348
Wrong doll, ya dick!

320
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,868
Well, we'd best be going, then.

321
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,228
If we don't catch this Dybbuk

322
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,698
then the good people of New Orleans

323
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,576
will blame you for its mayhem.

324
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,687
I believe...

325
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,068
this belongs to you,
Monsieur Constantine.

326
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,288
Guys, this Fugitive

327
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,341
we're looking for is an evil spirit.

328
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,772
Crap.

329
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:35,220
Damn it, Ray, where the hell are you?

330
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,467
Ray?

331
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,478
What happened?

332
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,408
Sara, any sign of the Fugitive?

333
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,635
I think we may have a
Chucky situation here.

334
00:14:57,638 --> 00:14:58,826
What does that mean?

335
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:00,608
I reckon the Dybbuk is in a doll.

336
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,898
Rory, Ava, Sara needs backup.

337
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,188
A word.

338
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,658
I'm all ears.

339
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,068
You, uh, still want
your powers back, yeah?

340
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,590
Come on then.

341
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,838
All right. Come on, big guy.

342
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,290
Sara...

343
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,578
Oh, I had the weirdest dream.

344
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,038
I dreamed that

345
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,600
I was attacked by a... doll!

346
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,348
I'm gonna kill you, Goldilocks!

347
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,028
Agh!

348
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,068
You're late.

349
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,558
Still moving. Kill it!

350
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,709
No, no, no, no, no.

351
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:46,738
We need to question it and find out

352
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,030
if it's really Mike the Spike.

353
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,538
Who are you?

354
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,117
Your worst nightmare.

355
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,318
Aloha.

356
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,818
I brought you some meat.

357
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,328
Oh, my cut.

358
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,638
Um...

359
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,978
I stupidly ran my bike

360
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,148
straight into this guy's car door.

361
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,808
No.

362
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,168
No, he didn't look before
he opened the car door.

363
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,668
I know, I know.

364
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,648
I shouldn't have to pay, but...

365
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,799
I don't want to lose
the world's best job.

366
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,368
You're a really good
listener, you know that?

367
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,890
What happened?

368
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,548
Did someone hurt you?

369
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,846
So how does helping you
make me a shapeshifter again?

370
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,028
Well, it's simple, really.

371
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,118
If I never meet Desmond,

372
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,649
then this demon scum that's

373
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:14,150
after me doesn't hurt him,

374
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,653
which means that my guilt-ridden ass

375
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,526
never joins the Legends and
doesn't turn up to London

376
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,208
to give you a magical lobotomy.

377
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,255
- Now...
- Simple.

378
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:22,396
Now, the me from five months ago

379
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,767
is having a drink in there.

380
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,058
Now, I'll recognize you as Amaya.

381
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,432
All you have to do is
play the part, all right?

382
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,308
American accent, stick up my bum,

383
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,378
and in love with Nate.

384
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,378
Do me a favor, just...

385
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,688
Make sure I get out of there

386
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,800
before I meet Dez, all right?

387
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,008
- All right.
- Okay.

388
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,908
I'll meet you back on
the jumpship, John-O.

389
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,928
All right, Charlie-O.

390
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,148
Good luck.

391
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,898
John?

392
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,188
As I live and breathe.

393
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,658
Amaya.

394
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,278
- Nice bonnet, love.
- Thank you.

395
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,408
Last I heard you were in, uh, Zambesi.

396
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,338
So where's Nate and the
rest of the crew, then?

397
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,963
Oh, Nate, my boyfriend.

398
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,208
And my crazy gang of best friends.

399
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,168
Oh, it is such a long story.

400
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,557
- Right.
- But a really good one.

401
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,288
How about I tell you all about it

402
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,938
over a glass of chardonnay?

403
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,298
Chardonnay, eh?

404
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,348
All right, barkeep!

405
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,588
Uh, no, no, not here.

406
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,348
I... I know a better place.

407
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,108
All right, well, you owe me dinner.

408
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,310
That is a fair price.

409
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:20,447
All right, go on.

410
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,780
Order up!

411
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,648
Hey, Mona.

412
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,628
How's life? Liking the Time Bureau?

413
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,818
Settling in? Dating anyone?

414
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,448
Uh, good, great, yes.

415
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,385
I mean, there is someone.

416
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,308
Lay it on Nate.

417
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,718
I think it might be inappropriate.

418
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,808
'Cause I work here.

419
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,208
And he's here too?

420
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,798
Wow.

421
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,481
Exactly.

422
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:53,338
Yeah, I think I know
who you're talking about,

423
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,005
and trust me, he has a crush on you too.

424
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:58,017
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,744
I swore I was just imagining it.

426
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:03,898
We don't even, like,
speak the same language.

427
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,018
Well, he does have a unique way

428
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,148
of expressing himself.

429
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,358
I'm afraid people would
think it was weird.

430
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,908
I mean, that hair.

431
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,338
Well, he just needs the right product.

432
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,988
What about the man meat?

433
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,528
Um, well, what... What about it?

434
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,918
I think he's, you know...

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,178
Had some.

436
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,918
It wouldn't surprise me.

437
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,178
I mean, it's 2018. I don't judge.

438
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,258
Mm, I should probably forget about it.

439
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,098
No. Carpe datum.

440
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,338
What do you got to lose?

441
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,388
My job.

442
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,717
I will make sure you're not fired

443
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,900
for following your heart.

444
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,268
Okay. I'll do it.

445
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,278
I'm gonna let him know how I feel.

446
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,158
One thing I learned
from the Chucky movies

447
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,028
is the doll always comes back.

448
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,568
Gideon, how's the timeline?

449
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,378
History is on track, and Marie Laveau

450
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,118
lived a long and celebrated life,

451
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,988
inspiring an Emmy-nominated portrayal

452
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,048
by Angela Bassett.

453
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,802
See? Rory killed the Dybbuk.

454
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,288
Which is unfortunate because

455
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,708
now I have to explain to Mr. Heywood

456
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,218
why I'm bringing him a seared doll

457
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,783
instead of a magical creature.

458
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:11,728
Well, at least we get to find out

459
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,258
why they call it the Big Easy.

460
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,417
Did you happen to notice that
Rory robbed that party blind?

461
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:17,466
I believe it.

462
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:18,407
I don't understand why

463
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,841
you enable his bad behavior.

464
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,307
At the Bureau, we would fire people

465
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,548
for lesser offenses.

466
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,388
Well, at the Bureau,

467
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,096
you don't have to eat, drink,
and sleep with your team.

468
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,078
Point taken.

469
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,728
It's just... this is supposed to be

470
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,322
a professional operation, babe.

471
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,158
Look, deep down, Rory's a good guy.

472
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
And, honestly, a friend.

473
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,188
I get it.

474
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,898
You run your team, I'll run mine.

475
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,258
- Thank you.
- Speaking of,

476
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,588
I should get back to the Bureau.

477
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,588
How 'bout you stay for dinner?

478
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,838
I could use a shower.

479
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,788
Hmm.

480
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,667
It's not like that
thing's going anywhere.

481
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,393
So?

482
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,245
When are these changes
to history gonna set in?

483
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:10,867
'Cause you know I've got some big plans.

484
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,398
I'm actually thinking of Vegas first.

485
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,398
Well, time takes a moment to cement,

486
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,208
or so I'm told enough by Sara.

487
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,628
But don't worry, love,

488
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:20,457
we'll have you shapeshifting
again in no time.

489
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,464
John-O? You all good?

490
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:41,487
We stopped me from meeting Dez tonight,

491
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,547
but now I meet him a
few days later instead.

492
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,909
We have to go back.

493
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,517
I'm afraid returning to New Orleans

494
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,042
is impossible, Mr. Constantine.

495
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,183
And why is that?

496
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,407
Because I know you two
are up to something.

497
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,248
And as much as I hate babysitting,

498
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,362
I hate being played even more.

499
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,237
Gideon, bring them
back to the Waverider.

500
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,498
They have some serious explaining to do.

501
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,628
Here's one thing you need to understand,

502
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,268
is that I don't go in
for all that love crap.

503
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,938
Romance is for little girls
crying into their pillows,

504
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,258
not for a devious tosser like me

505
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,020
who knows the score.

506
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,948
But then...

507
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,188
six months ago, I met him.

508
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,448
Desmond.

509
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:31,966
And that first night was like

510
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:34,477
a second line had marched
into my useless heart

511
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,628
and breathed some life into it again.

512
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,037
Desmond knew who I was,

513
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,328
exactly what I'd done, and...

514
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:42,639
he didn't care.

515
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:44,120
So I was all in.

516
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,738
Rented an apartment.

517
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,448
And then this demon shows up.

518
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,998
Neron.

519
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,498
Wanted me to help him usurp

520
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,323
the triumvirate ruling hell.

521
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:57,498
Well, he must have had something
on you to expect that.

522
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,728
The deed to my soul.

523
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,456
When I die, the bastard owns me.

524
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,425
And he's already worked out lots of...

525
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:09,556
excruciating torments for
yours truly in the inferno.

526
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,897
So, naturally, I told Neron to piss off.

527
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,950
Naturally.

528
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,498
I begged Dez to run.

529
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,358
I knew that Neron would
use him against me.

530
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,338
Johnny?

531
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,998
The bloody fool didn't listen.

532
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,208
So Neron...

533
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,900
dragged Dez to hell because of me.

534
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,956
I didn't think there was
a way I could save him.

535
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,127
That's the thing about
time travel, right?

536
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,810
There's always a way.

537
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,028
I joined the Legends thinking
I could outrun my guilt,

538
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,368
but being back in New
Orleans, I realize...

539
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,038
I was just taking the coward's way out.

540
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,948
So I had to save him.

541
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,157
So.

542
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,749
Now that you, uh,
know what we was up to,

543
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,369
uh, do you mind explaining
why it didn't work?

544
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:10,704
Some points in history are fixed.

545
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:13,395
Maybe John and Desmond
were supposed to meet.

546
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,387
Look, I'm sorry.

547
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,086
I'm gonna do everything I can

548
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,917
to find a loophole to save Desmond

549
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,480
and keep history intact.

550
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,047
You do that, love.

551
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,898
I know.

552
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,568
Um, an unscheduled visit.

553
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,118
It's good to see you too.

554
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:54,787
I brought you something.

555
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,578
Mm.

556
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,560
O...

557
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,958
Uh, "O... o mona...

558
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,108
ko'u inoa Mona."

559
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,348
O wai kou inoa?

560
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,758
Konane.

561
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,288
Konane.

562
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,458
Um...

563
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,641
"Shining like the moon."

564
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:27,232
That's a really pretty name.

565
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,180
Mona.

566
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,415
Yep. Yep.

567
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:43,667
That's me.

568
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,318
E holo a huna!

569
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,648
- A huna!
- Well, "a huna"...

570
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,032
Uh...

571
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:54,938
"Run and hide."

572
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:56,921
Is someone coming?

573
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,148
Mona.

574
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,348
Hello?

575
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,660
Is someone there?

576
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:04,377
Compelling story back there.

577
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,797
Still, you're hardly the
kind of guy to open up,

578
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,068
unless, of course, you were stalling.

579
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,672
Well, you see,

580
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,053
magic has rules, just like time travel,

581
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:15,888
and I just so happen to write the book

582
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,360
on breaking them.

583
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,737
So, if meeting Desmond
is a fixed point in time,

584
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,211
then I need to go back
to after I met him.

585
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:23,772
Stop him from falling for me.

586
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,597
That's how I save Desmond's life.

587
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,398
History be bloody damned.

588
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,680
Well, you went all-out.

589
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,008
What the hell is he doing here?

590
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,219
Leaving.

591
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,422
Wait.

592
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:56,508
Wait. Both of you.

593
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,428
Please look.

594
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,528
I roasted a roast.

595
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,528
Technically, Captain, I fabricated...

596
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,198
Shut up, Gideon.

597
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,458
Ava, you are my love,

598
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,278
and Mick, you are my family,

599
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,102
and it would mean the world to me

600
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:20,125
if both of you would try to get along.

601
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,090
Please.

602
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,998
So I was thinking...

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,478
maybe you two could
find some common ground.

604
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,508
For example...

605
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,313
Ava, you love to read.

606
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:36,829
Mick here is an author.

607
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,620
Oh. Well, that's something.

608
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:40,397
Though I would be shocked if his novel

609
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,455
wasn't sexist and derivative.

610
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,875
It is.

611
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:45,536
Okay, well,

612
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,188
Mick, you love to eat.

613
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,938
Ava is a fantastic baker.

614
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,998
She makes one mean snickerdoodle.

615
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,891
Fancy sugar cookies.

616
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:54,744
Snickerdoodles are actually
completely different.

617
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,334
It's a cream of tartar base, but...

618
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,188
- Garbage cookies.
- That's rich,

619
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:00,501
coming from a man who's so
lacking in personal hygiene

620
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:01,838
that he had to resort to sleeping with

621
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,628
a three-breasted alien sex toy.

622
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,100
Well, at least Garima isn't a clone.

623
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,678
Only I get to use the C word.

624
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,688
Too far, Mick. Too far.

625
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,098
Why do you get to
have a fake girlfriend,

626
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,270
and I don't?

627
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:21,858
Clone.

628
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,388
Dick.

629
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:32,118
Hey.

630
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,538
Any luck?

631
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,078
I'm sorry, John.

632
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,028
Sometimes with history,
if you change one thing,

633
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,038
it creates a whole domino effect.

634
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,368
It's all right.

635
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,298
Listen, I...

636
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,628
I get being tempted

637
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,038
to save someone you love.

638
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,388
The anger and frustration.

639
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,748
It's...

640
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,968
John?

641
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,128
Yep.

642
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,438
Turn around.

643
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,808
I... I'd rather not.

644
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,078
That is the last time that I try that.

645
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,336
I thought you couldn't...

646
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:11,888
You know what, it doesn't matter.

647
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,620
Where is John?

648
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,033
The last time we did
something like this,

649
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,607
we almost destroyed the entire world.

650
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,448
All right, all right. Okay, enough.

651
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,948
How are you planning to find John?

652
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,524
Well, his tracker...

653
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,428
- Which you told him about.
- Yep.

654
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,808
Old John-O's changing history commando.

655
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,398
You know, I understand why John's being

656
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,160
so colossally stupid,
but what's your excuse?

657
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,938
I'm dying.

658
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,313
What?

659
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,798
Look, every time that I shapeshift,

660
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,128
it's like I'm born all over again.

661
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,658
But stuck in this body

662
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,968
for the first time in centuries,

663
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,118
I'm getting older.

664
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,928
But if John saves Desmond,

665
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,998
then he never joins the Legends,

666
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,328
and I'm immortal again.

667
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,718
Let me get this straight.

668
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,208
You helped John risk

669
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,162
a catastrophic rupture to history

670
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:22,018
because you're afraid of aging?

671
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,398
Okay.

672
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,318
Maybe John succeeds and you go

673
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,728
on your immortal, merry way.

674
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,657
But if he fails,

675
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,658
I will personally make sure

676
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,408
you spend the rest of your
short, dreary, human life

677
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,738
in the deepest, darkest prison cell

678
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,338
the Bureau has to offer.

679
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,537
Let's move.

680
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,288
Look, I'm... I'm sorry. This is my fault.

681
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,005
I shouldn't have forced
it on you and Mick.

682
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,078
No. He was just stating
a fact, you know.

683
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,868
I am a... clone.

684
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,378
Hey.

685
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,276
No, it's okay.

686
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,728
Sometimes I just wish I could

687
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,758
be more like you and
the Legends, you know.

688
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,230
Loosen up. I...

689
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,598
When did that happen?

690
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,218
What?

691
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,598
Oh, no.

692
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,693
I'll get a broom.

693
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:52,888
Ava, wait.

694
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,078
Are those tiny little footprints?

695
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,620
The Dybbuk is alive.

696
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,670
What?

697
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,169
Okay, we shouldn't split up.

698
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:13,668
Classic horror-movie mistake.

699
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,418
Well, we're not exactly helpless.

700
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,676
Fine. I'll go fix Gideon.

701
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,508
And I'm gonna go catch a serial killer!

702
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,980
You are way too excited about this.

703
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,420
What the hell?

704
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,498
John.

705
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,218
How the bloody hell did you find me?

706
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,757
John, you have to stop this.

707
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,168
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell

708
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,498
and you don't join the Legends,

709
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,798
the effects could be cataclysmic.

710
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,008
Neron didn't drag Dez to hell.

711
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,298
I did.

712
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,888
What do you mean?

713
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,058
When I told Dez to run,
he went behind my back.

714
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,508
Made a deal to protect me.

715
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,678
In exchange for sparing my life,

716
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,781
Dez had to bind his soul to Neron's.

717
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:20,117
I couldn't send Neron to hell

718
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,687
without sending Dez down with him.

719
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,830
Johnny?

720
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,318
Johnny.

721
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,338
Johnny!

722
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,998
No!

723
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,058
I killed the man I loved, and for what?

724
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,728
To buy New Orleans a little more time?

725
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,538
Neron needs souls to take over hell,

726
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,788
and mark my words, he is coming
back to Earth to get them.

727
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,528
John, we can help you.

728
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,028
Yeah, spare the team bit, all right?

729
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,590
I work alone.

730
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,128
- You back already?
- Yeah.

731
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,728
Dez, I'm, ah, back already.

732
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,568
Hey, Johnny.

733
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,860
Hey, Dez.

734
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,058
I'm gonna get some clothes on.

735
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,498
It's dead.

736
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,618
The Dybbuk must have
found another vessel.

737
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,668
Is there another doll on
the ship somewhere, Rory?

738
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,788
What the hell was that?

739
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,458
Block the exit.

740
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,758
Okay, so whatever it is,
it has tiny little feet,

741
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,528
so it's not that big.

742
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:24,040
Ow.

743
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,478
Ya dumb blonde!

744
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,368
It's not size that matters,

745
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,171
it's how you use it! Agh!

746
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,498
Agh! Agh!

747
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,638
Ragh!

748
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,328
Professor Stein?

749
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,048
No! It's Mikey, you dick!

750
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,818
Here.

751
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,798
Thank you.

752
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,110
Where is he?

753
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,790
It really is Mike the Spike.

754
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,570
Stop!

755
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,937
- Where are you taking him?
- You.

756
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,068
I am the Assistant
Coordinator of Creature Upkeep.

757
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,945
It's my job to take
care of magical beings.

758
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:30,247
- Not for long.
- Let him go!

759
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,948
I'm warning you.

760
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,888
Konane, no!

761
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,628
Agh!

762
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,778
You have to go.

763
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,428
They'll kill you...

764
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,488
- You okay?
- Shh.

765
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,698
- Mike's up there.
- Mike the Spike?

766
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,288
Yeah, and he's found a new vessel.

767
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,622
Much, much worse.

768
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,907
Hold on.

769
00:38:22,211 --> 00:38:24,997
What could be worse than
a creepy antebellum doll?

770
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,864
Where are the eggs?

771
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,387
Thought you said you were gonna cook.

772
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,900
Yeah, I changed my mind.

773
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,807
I'll finish getting dressed,
and we can go out to eat.

774
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,678
You know, it's, uh...

775
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:43,451
it's not about the breakfast, Dez.

776
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,568
Mm. Kay.

777
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,078
I see what you're doing.

778
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,338
You know what your problem is, Johnny?

779
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,248
You don't think you deserve to be happy.

780
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,658
Dez, your feelings for me
are a bloody lie, all right?

781
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,538
See, I just wanted to
get you into my bed,

782
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,158
but I couldn't be bothered
to put the work in, so...

783
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,470
I used a love spell on you.

784
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,188
This a joke?

785
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,168
Afraid not, mate.

786
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,777
Hey, uh...

787
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,358
I really care about you.

788
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,048
If there's something
going on in your life,

789
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,282
just be honest with me.

790
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:20,518
Yeah, do you know what?

791
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,278
This thing between us? It isn't real.

792
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,518
It never was. It doesn't exist.

793
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,448
I put myself out there like this,

794
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,118
and you're playing games?

795
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,068
You should go.

796
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,118
Yeah, you're right. I should.

797
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,958
But this...

798
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,078
this thing between us?

799
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,248
This was real, Johnny.

800
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,076
Sara, do you read me?

801
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,448
John's done something awful.

802
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:07,897
Well, he hasn't done anything yet.

803
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,898
I'm still stuck in this form.

804
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,398
Uh...

805
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,548
What's that?

806
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,307
Guys! Guys, guys, guys!

807
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,838
I have a real emergency here.

808
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,188
Oh!

809
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,618
Marty!

810
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,267
Die, you putz!

811
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,127
I hate puppets!

812
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,528
Suck my...

813
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,298
Blast...

814
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,348
Oi, Z! Check this out!

815
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,848
I got my powers back!

816
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,808
Don't be mad, I'm myself again.

817
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,658
Whoo!

818
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,790
Where's Zari?

819
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,988
Zari?

820
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,828
Oh, blimey.

821
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:51,429
