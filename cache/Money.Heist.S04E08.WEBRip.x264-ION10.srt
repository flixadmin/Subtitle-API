1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,750
How do I look?

2
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,003
Powerful.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,246
Beautiful.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,253
Martín...

5
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,455
for years,
you've been going around in circles...

6
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,291
feeling this way.

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,633
I think it's time you moved on.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,670
We can move on to wine, if you like.

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,253
- Shall we have a glass?
- No.

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,333
I'm not drinking that with you.

11
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,001
I'm going to dinner.
With Tatiana.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,630
- Right.
- You'll think about me,

13
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,746
but...

14
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,378
I won't think about you.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,080
You don't have to spell it out for me.
It's clear.

16
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,416
Oh, please.
Do you think I don't love you?

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
I also feel that what we have between us

18
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,503
is extraordinary, unique, wonderful.

19
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,166
I know about love.
I've been married 5 times.

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,040
- OK.
- What I've never told you is that...

21
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,996
I've never felt anything
with any of those women

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,040
remotely similar to what I have with you.

23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,378
Not even close.

24
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,131
You and I are soul mates.

25
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,785
But only 99%.

26
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,833
As you know, I really like women.

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,830
And you like me too much.

28
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,245
And what's 1% against 99%?

29
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:13,538
- Unless you're not brave enough to try it.
- That 1% is a tiny mitochondrion...

30
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,923
but it defines my desire.

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,036
Mitochondrion.

32
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,211
Where's your desire?

33
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,173
Here?

34
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,293
Where is it?

35
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,543
Don't worry. Relax.

36
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,958
Don't be afraid.

37
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,751
You're a coward, huh?

38
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,126
Where is it?

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,170
Look...

40
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,206
I'd give anything to feel that,
but...

41
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,665
it's impossible.

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,211
It's impossible.

43
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,495
I love you, Martín.

44
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,418
But my brother is right.
We must part ways.

45
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,248
And we have to scrap the plan.

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,035
Your son-of-a-bitch brother
told you I loved you

47
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,495
to break up this house.

48
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,503
You're going to go and make photocopies
in the Royal Mint, right?

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,790
I suggested melting gold together.

50
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,455
You're hooked on something
that will never exist!

51
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,833
I have to leave you. It's...

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,630
for love.

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,206
For brotherhood.

54
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
For the commitment I have to you.

55
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,918
Leave...

56
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,131
and heal the wound.

57
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,665
Sometimes distance
is the only way to find peace.

58
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,461
Farewell, my friend.

59
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,831
I'm sure that one way or another,
time will bring us back together.

60
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,331
As Alicia Sierra
walked towards the slaughterhouse...

61
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,788
she wore an enigmatic smile
that no one noticed.

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,130
It was not the smile
of someone about to throw in the towel.

63
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,790
Please, over here.

64
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,825
Is it true you sent for the daughter
of Ágata Jiménez, Nairobi,

65
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,876
so she'd go to the window
and you could shoot her?

66
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,918
- Did she die from that shot?
- That is untrue.

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,581
It was a boy, not a girl.

68
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,286
Nine years old.

69
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,325
And yes, I sent for him.

70
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,786
With the knowledge of my superiors,
of course.

71
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,535
- What are you doing?
- We shot her in the chest.

72
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't allow a doctor to go in
to operate.

73
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,043
Antoñanzas, turn the volume up!

74
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,826
Her friends saved her.
All for nothing.

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,080
She was killed
by the Bank of Spain's head of security,

76
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,036
Gandía,
with the backing of Colonel Tamayo.

77
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,665
- Fucking bitch.
- It needs to be said.

78
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,881
More questions.

79
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,288
Is it true that this Osman...

80
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,285
I don't know if you know him...

81
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,825
buried Cortés alive?

82
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,286
Yes, we buried him alive.

83
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,575
In Timimoun...

84
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,786
Tamayo's world was falling apart.

85
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,375
Of course I know Osman.
He's a professional.

86
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,956
Capable of burying a man alive...

87
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,881
and leaving him shaking like a leaf
without him dying.

88
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,626
His public image was crumbling,
and the worst was yet to come.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,290
Inside the bank,
his big gamble was unconscious.

90
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,205
Palermo.

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
- How is he?
- We're operating.

92
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,790
On a stretcher and badly wounded.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Save his life.

94
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,461
Didn't you drug him?

95
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,421
Drugs? We drugged him.

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,710
Inhaled, to be precise.

97
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,461
We hung him up, threw cold water on him,
and he shat himself.

98
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,171
Everything the boy said
is absolutely and totally true.

99
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,500
And there are plenty of things
that he forgot to say.

100
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,543
Was the government aware of this?

101
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,423
Aware?

102
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,331
The government gave the orders.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,420
I didn't wake up one day and say,
I'll interrogate the boy hard.

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,380
No! I had everyone's backing.

105
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,628
The CNI, police commanders,
and the Ministry of the Interior.

106
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,578
Absolutely everyone knew about it.

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,415
And now you know.
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,415
Alicia Sierra,
negotiator at the Bank of Spain,

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,040
reveals all, and nobody is spared.

110
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,375
She admits to torture
but holds the government responsible.

111
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:05,245
The government gave the orders,
and she says, everyone knew.

112
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,043
We have to bury that bitch.

113
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,625
While all of Spain was glued to the TV,

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,668
in a former Chinese restaurant
in Madrid,

115
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,670
Benjamín and his men...

116
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,455
were raising hell.

117
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,746
Marseille.

118
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,833
Arriving at extraction point.

119
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,246
Received.

120
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,668
One, two, three.

121
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,830
How many meters?

122
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,495
Four meters.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,670
I need you to work faster.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,170
Lisbon will be guarded by 26 officers,
split between seven vehicles.

125
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,418
Three behind...

126
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,753
and three in front.

127
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,670
In the middle, the van she'll be in.

128
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,713
They'll go to the National Court first
and then to the prison.

129
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,751
What's the most vulnerable point?

130
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,633
On the road. From point A to B.

131
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,328
- No.
- In the courtroom?

132
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,746
No.

133
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,583
- Are we going to tunnel into the prison?
- No.

134
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,416
But there is a place that is vulnerable.

135
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,080
We've all seen it.

136
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,920
On TV.

137
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:14,875
When the National Court's entrance is
full of journalists, what do the cops do?

138
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,746
They take the prisoner...

139
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,791
through the parking garage.

140
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,666
Only the van goes in.

141
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,668
In 30 seconds, that armored convoy
goes from having 26 officers...

142
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,171
to six. And from seven vehicles...

143
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,826
to one.

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,420
POLICE

145
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,210
And a parking garage is not a bunker
or a high-security prison.

146
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,171
- It's...
- A parking garage.

147
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,460
Exactly.

148
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,165
From the National Court parking garage

149
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,960
to the basement of our restaurant,

150
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,791
there are exactly...

151
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,041
11 meters and 68 centimeters of sandstone.

152
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,165
Sandstone. You are Asturian miners.

153
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,830
- The best.
- What's that to you?

154
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,456
Nothing. Pick, shovel, grinder.

155
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,876
Minimum noise, maximum efficiency.

156
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,328
Ten hours, Benjamín, to have it ready.

157
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,496
- And the extraction?
- Silent industrial machinery.

158
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,285
We'll take the rubble to the kitchen.

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,790
It'll be a clean and quick operation.

160
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,496
Benjamín?

161
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,875
Five meters.

162
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:03,955
Palermo.

163
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,245
I'm listening, Professor.

164
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,040
How is he?

165
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,535
He's conscious.

166
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,788
General physical condition?

167
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:23,291
He can't move one arm. He's lost blood.
He can hardly breathe.

168
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,575
He's a total wreck.

169
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,081
But will he recover?

170
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,876
If I were his mother,
I'd be lighting candles.

171
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,710
I'm telling you that he'll recover.

172
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,831
I'll make sure of it personally.

173
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,826
Even if I have to be with him
for six months.

174
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,131
But I'll make you better.

175
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,331
I'll feed you soup.
I'll make you strong again.

176
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,326
And when you're as strong as an ox,
do you know what will happen?

177
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,131
I'll kill you.

178
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,455
I'll beat you to death.

179
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,543
Why the fuck are we saving
this motherfucker's life?

180
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,415
- Can he speak?
- So far, he's not saying much.

181
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,130
My name is Stockholm.
Do you remember me?

182
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,918
Let go of me, fucking bitch, scumbag.

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,830
Let go.

184
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,628
Professor, he can talk.

185
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,415
He killed Nairobi.

186
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What the fuck are we doing?

187
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,503
- We have to kill him!
- That'll depend on him, Rio.

188
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,003
If he wants to live, he'll live.

189
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,041
If he wants to die...

190
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:31,996
he'll die.

191
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,786
It depends on him?

192
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,961
You can't say that.

193
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,831
You have no clue
how we're feeling in here.

194
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,826
You don't know what it's like
to look him in the eyes.

195
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,876
- Tokyo...
- Don't talk to me like you're my dad.

196
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,206
Do you know how I feel?

197
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,205
Do you know how Helsinki feels?

198
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,710
Helsinki is stitching him up.

199
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,955
He's treating him.
Do you know who he treated before? No.

200
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,291
You don't know.
Of course you don't.

201
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,825
You don't know anything.
You're hiding like a rat.

202
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,826
That's how you keep giving orders
after Nairobi's death,

203
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:16,706
without shedding a tear.
You feel nothing!

204
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,421
Enough!

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,960
You feel nothing!

206
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,001
Stop.

207
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,213
- Nothing!
- Stop!

208
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,831
Do you want to feed him soup too?

209
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,998
Tokyo, I would take him

210
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,206
and I'd stick a burning iron through him.

211
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,750
I'd take him down to the foundry,

212
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,166
and I'd put his head in the furnace
to finish him off.

213
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,128
You think I'm not hurting over Nairobi?
That the Professor isn't too?

214
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,538
Doesn't seem like it.

215
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,423
He's a prisoner.

216
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,790
And we don't kill prisoners.

217
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,165
As much as it pains us,
we don't kill prisoners.

218
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,001
Nor do we kill in cold blood.

219
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,883
But he did!

220
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,578
He killed Nairobi! She was sick.
She was unarmed. She'd surrendered!

221
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,920
We had a truce, for fuck's sake!

222
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,496
Now it's about saving our lives, Rio,
like we saved yours.

223
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,383
That involves collateral damage,
like swallowing the pain.

224
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,421
We've run out of time.
They broke the truce.

225
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
We have to turn this situation around.

226
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,828
Helsinki.

227
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,293
Helsinki!

228
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,421
Helsinki, no!

229
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,083
- No!
- Why did you kill her,

230
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,126
you son of a bitch?

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,040
Why'd you kill her?

232
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,250
Palermo.

233
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,753
Helsinki, look at me.

234
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,213
Look me in the eyes.

235
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,626
Helsinki!

236
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,876
Come on, brother.

237
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,205
Rio, Denver.

238
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,503
Get to work.

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,830
Now.

240
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,543
Palermo?

241
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,673
He's alive, sir.

242
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,710
Son of a bitch.

243
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,168
Are you having one?

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,830
You're having an anxiety thing.

245
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,996
It was very tense up there.

246
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,036
It'll pass in a minute.

247
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,125
I already know I'm fucked, Commissioner.
You don't need to remind me.

248
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,211
- What I want to know is what happened.
- Call them.

249
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,131
I've been a negotiator for 15 years.
I know when a deal's been accepted.

250
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,998
Call them.
You'll be with them in 24 hours.

251
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,463
We won't come after you.

252
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,001
She was against the ropes.
She was going to sell the Professor out.

253
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,503
I'd worn her down.
I'd almost defeated her.

254
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,793
Then something happened.

255
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,920
But what can happen
when someone is incommunicado?

256
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,918
Maybe she wasn't incommunicado.

257
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,330
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.

258
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,923
Don't let anyone in.

259
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,753
Antoñanzas?

260
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,040
What do you think...

261
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:38,923
Commissioner?

262
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,536
Should we go after Antoñanzas?

263
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,998
Smart creature.

264
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,876
It's really like a vacation.

265
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,958
I'll come back for you, Commissioner.

266
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,328
Court proceedings have been initiated
against Alicia Sierra

267
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
and a warrant issued for her arrest.

268
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,210
The police negotiator
could be the first arrest

269
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,961
in the Bank of Spain heist,
absurd as it sounds.

270
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,751
She's accused of false imprisonment
and torture

271
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,673
following the press conference
from the Ministry of the Interior.

272
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,960
The minister, the director of the CNI,
and police commanders

273
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,171
are preparing libel and slander lawsuits
against the inspector.

274
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,290
Confirmed.
Interior requests her immediate arrest.

275
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,166
Go after her!

276
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,455
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,581
I'm directly responsible
for all this shit.

278
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,998
I didn't calculate the pain
it'd cause you. I'm sorry.

279
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,916
What do you know about pain, Palermo?

280
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,423
Pain is a loan shark.

281
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,785
It leaves you with a debt
that you can never pay back.

282
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,713
I can take pain.

283
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,540
A lot of pain.

284
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:34,246
Oh, yeah?
What about the pain you're feeling now?

285
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,631
It's different, right?

286
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,956
I saw it in your eyes.

287
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,206
It was like seeing myself in the mirror.

288
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,746
You have no idea...

289
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,881
where you'll fall.

290
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
Get out of there now.

291
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,995
Otherwise, you run the risk of...
becoming a piece of shit like me.

292
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:09,415
This horrible monster I've turned into.
A guy who destroys everything he touches.

293
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,748
Someone who's wanted to die
for many years.

294
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,705
And you can't get out of there.
You never get out.

295
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,961
Look, brother.

296
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,041
All that boom, boom, ciao crap...

297
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,325
I treated you like shit.

298
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,378
I didn't dare. I couldn't.
I didn't know how.

299
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,333
But let me say, I'm by your side.
I won't let you fall.

300
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,576
I know.

301
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,461
I've known from the start.

302
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,213
I know who you are.

303
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,461
My name is Martín Berrote.

304
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:55,421
I was born in Buenos Aires,
but I live in Palermo, Sicily.

305
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,670
I'm going to get you out of here alive.
Even if I have to die doing it.

306
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,746
My name is Mirko Dragic.

307
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,995
I'm from Belgrade.

308
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,125
I lost Oslo in the Mint.

309
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,923
I lost Nairobi.

310
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,415
And I'm not losing anyone else.

311
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,253
You included, Martín Berrote.

312
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,581
NATIONAL COURT
09:34 HOURS

313
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,496
Lisbon will start testifying
at the National Court.

314
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,753
She'll give reliable, specific details,
earning the judge's trust.

315
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,923
And she'll do it meticulously
because all of this...

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,960
is part of the Paris Plan.

317
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,246
What is the Paris Plan?

318
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,378
A rescue plan
in case either of us is caught.

319
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,625
But why Paris?

320
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,916
Because Paris is the city of freedom.

321
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,285
And of love.

322
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,495
Who hasn't strolled around Paris in love?
Right, boys?

323
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,458
What will Lisbon tell the judge?

324
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,331
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

325
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
And in fact, she'll start with love.

326
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,875
How did you reunite with Sergio Marquina?
Did you arrange it?

327
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,035
I met him a year after we escaped,

328
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,915
in Palawan in the Philippines.

329
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,543
He left me a puzzle with coordinates.
He might not look it, but he's romantic.

330
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,665
She'll tell them everything.

331
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,423
Everything, where we lived,
how often we relocated.

332
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,920
After an hour and a half,
she'll tell them the plan.

333
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
What do you mean?

334
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,876
- She can't do that.
- She can.

335
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,288
Truth is the basis of trust,
and that's a fact.

336
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,625
The plan's to steal 90 tons of gold
from the national reserve.

337
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,958
We're melting it.

338
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,250
- They're melting it in there?
- Of course.

339
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,793
By now, they'll have done around 50 tons.

340
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,035
We're using industrial furnaces
made by Hormund.

341
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,125
Hormund.

342
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,828
German. They're the best.

343
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,125
- Benjamín, how are we doing?
- Seven and a half meters!

344
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,328
Faster.

345
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,626
Faster!

346
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,958
We'll give them all the details.

347
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,711
They reach 2,300°C,
and gold melts at 1,064°C.

348
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,081
We'll overwhelm them
with technical details, so their brains...

349
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,286
have to keep processing information.

350
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:41,165
We knew that the vault floods
at a rate of 7,500 liters a minute.

351
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,130
Very detailed information.

352
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,668
And we'll do that to...

353
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,293
- tire them out.
- That's right.

354
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,575
The challenge
was the interconnection tube.

355
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,496
Can I have some paper and a pen?

356
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,543
I'm going to tire you out.

357
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,833
- Meters?
- Nine meters!

358
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,746
Faster.

359
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,543
The vault door...

360
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,875
14 tons of steel...

361
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,828
We had to cut a circle in it
in just minutes...

362
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,166
The bathyscaphe floods...

363
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,250
The diver enters...
We weld the tube...

364
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:15,083
to equalize the pressure...
it comes out the other side.

365
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,536
A bit like this.

366
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Have some dinner brought in.

367
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:30,496
They say that pregnant women
have a sharper sense of smell.

368
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,325
It was perhaps the only thing
the Professor hadn't foreseen.

369
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,745
It was the first time
someone had picked up his scent

370
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,213
without him sensing it.

371
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,328
Antoñanzas's wife
had not yet seen the news.

372
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,881
- Marisa?
- Sierra took less than 3 minutes

373
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,958
to get the information she needed.

374
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:55,081
- I'm a colleague of Benito's.
- I know who you are.

375
00:26:56,083 --> 00:27:00,333
Let me see, where do I begin?
Benito has been acting...

376
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:04,748
- weird lately, nervous...
- Antoñanzas had seemed anxious at home.

377
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,503
So much so,
he'd been swimming late at night

378
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,633
with two friends in the pool.

379
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,126
And it seemed like he was drunk.

380
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,876
Colonel, Sierra isn't at home.
She must have fled.

381
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,958
Fucking bitch.

382
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,633
All units, an arrest warrant's been issued
for Alicia Sierra.

383
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,496
I can't give you the footage
even if you are an officer.

384
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,126
I need permission from a judge
or the residents' association president.

385
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,998
Oh wait, someone's calling me.

386
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,003
It's the residents' association president.

387
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,285
How are you, President?

388
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,495
OK, thank you.

389
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,455
He says yes.

390
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,998
Give me the tapes of the entrance,

391
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:01,583
the pool, the parking lot, the street...
All of them.

392
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,745
Listen, Amanda.

393
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,793
What you did before...

394
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,881
Making unfounded accusations
against me...

395
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,788
- I don't want to hear it. Leave me alone.
- Look...

396
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:32,165
Didn't you hear her? Leave her alone.
Don't make me kick you out of here.

397
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,420
What are you doing?

398
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,830
Everyone quiet, now!

399
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,383
You're despicable. You make me cringe.

400
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,958
You're calling me despicable?
You?

401
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,131
A banker.

402
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,288
A puppet of the system and of capitalism.

403
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,245
You're giving me lessons in ethics?

404
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,673
A man who didn't have the balls
to defend his workers

405
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,710
- and face the terrorists.
- Enough!

406
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,423
On the ground!

407
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,790
Hands behind your head!

408
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,495
Come on. All right!

409
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,833
You, over there!

410
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:09,076
- Arturo!
- Everyone on their feet.

411
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,916
I'll get you out, I promise.

412
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,790
All of you! That's the difference
between you and me, Governor.

413
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,415
I came to save all these people,
to be a hero.

414
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,290
While you piss your pants
at the slightest thing.

415
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,455
- Governor.
- Arturo.

416
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,383
She's got a gun.

417
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,538
You're going to put that G36 on the floor
in the next three seconds.

418
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,375
If you don't, you're dead.

419
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,540
Who are you?
If you don't mind me asking.

420
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,625
Manila.
Undercover agent for the gang.

421
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,628
Well, look...

422
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,831
Manila, I don't buy a word of it.

423
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,996
And that gun is one of the fake ones
they give us.

424
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,173
You don't fool me.

425
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,961
You have two seconds.
Put the gun down,

426
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,581
and pray it's not true you raped Amanda.

427
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,706
You're pissing me off.
I'm losing my patience.

428
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,001
- One.
- So...

429
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,580
I didn't rape her.

430
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,538
I just gave her some anxiety meds.

431
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,955
I'm bleeding out.

432
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,631
I'm dying.

433
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,038
You're not. There's an exit wound.

434
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,035
There are no arteries
or anything important there.

435
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:24,671
Arturo, you're under arrest,
accused of rape.

436
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:25,921
And...

437
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:33,746
may I remind you
that you offered me pills too, scumbag.

438
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,036
That night in the bank, no one slept.

439
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,130
But the worst news

440
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:45,291
was that, outside,
our biggest enemy was wasting no time.

441
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,955
Sierra saw Antoñanzas fall.
She saw him hit the springboard.

442
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:57,378
Seconds later,
the Professor and Marseille appeared.

443
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,833
It was 3:11 in the morning.

444
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,245
Minutes later, she had the license plate.

445
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,673
What's up, cutie?

446
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,291
- Fuck, Alicia, don't give me shit.
- Take it easy.

447
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,455
I have a license plate
from April 7 at 3:00 a.m.

448
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:30,791
It left a street off the M-30.
I need to know where it went.

449
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,415
You're a wanted woman.
I'm taking a risk.

450
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,210
How many times
have I taken risks for you, Raúl?

451
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,583
Should I remind you of the last time?
Don't fuck with me.

452
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,705
Meters?

453
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,171
Nine and a half!

454
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,290
Lisbon's mission...

455
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,080
is to buy us the time we need.

456
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,126
You see...

457
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,706
people can concentrate
for about 50 minutes.

458
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,711
However important that information is,

459
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,381
there's a point
when you can't take any more.

460
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,248
They'll have no choice
but to continue the next day.

461
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,043
Do you know anything
about underwater welding?

462
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,995
Or about how to use
a thermic lance underwater?

463
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,383
In water, you cut metal with fire.

464
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,998
Fire? Underwater?

465
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,423
- How are we doing?
- Ten meters!

466
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,326
Faster.

467
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,706
Faster!

468
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,711
Fire underwater
to get to the state secrets,

469
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,081
key to the negotiation.

470
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,956
But it didn't work.
We had to use the dolphin.

471
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,541
A dolphin?

472
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,075
Ten and a half.

473
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,633
Flipper is the name we gave
the governor of the Bank of Spain.

474
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,918
It was the fastest way
to get the secrets and negotiate.

475
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,920
That's an act of coercion.

476
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,080
- I know.
- And disclosure of secrets.

477
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,826
We sent the secrets to an external server.

478
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:55,626
Lend me the pencil,
and I can outline how the IT system works.

479
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,878
It's almost one in the morning.

480
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,668
Maybe we should take a break.

481
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,420
If the prosecution
and the defense agree...

482
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,330
She'll go back to prison.

483
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,751
And we'll keep chipping away...

484
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,998
and chipping away.

485
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:22,535
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we'll have drilled through

486
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,785
the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel.

487
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,995
And at last...
we'll access the parking garage.

488
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,665
- Questions?
- How do we get into the garage

489
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,580
without being seen?

490
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,633
Good!

491
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,328
Very good question.

492
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,786
In two stages. First, Pakistan.

493
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,915
- Pakistan.
- Yes.

494
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,830
And you'll give the order.

495
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,535
The mole is out for a walk.

496
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Shakir.

497
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,496
- Shakir, now.
- Perfect, Professor.

498
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:07,173
From Pakistan, they'll change the signal
of the internal CCTV.

499
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,290
And from then on,
the guards will see a recording.

500
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,921
Stage two, Marseille.

501
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:20,541
Marseille will be
at that critical point on a night out,

502
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,785
when all the bars in Madrid
have closed, but...

503
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,463
you want to keep dancing
with your new hookup,

504
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,831
Sheila.

505
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:31,955
Marseille.

506
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
Speaking.

507
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,251
- Benjamín?
- Speaking.

508
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:40,253
And that will drown out the noise
of the angle grinders.

509
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,833
Stopwatches.

510
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,131
Three, two...

511
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,248
one...

512
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,080
now.

513
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,745
Now.

514
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,245
Good evening. Is there a problem?

515
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,213
What the hell are you doing?

516
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,791
Having a party.
All the bars are closed.

517
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,665
So we're having a little party
here in the car.

518
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,706
Marseille, hang on.

519
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,081
Hang on, Marseille.

520
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,788
One minute!

521
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,995
What sort of party is it
with alcohol-free beer?

522
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,833
Well, I want to make love tonight.

523
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,786
And with alcohol...

524
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,785
And without alcohol...

525
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,751
Turn off the music.

526
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,210
Benjamín!

527
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,381
Thirty seconds!

528
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,830
Don't turn it off, Marseille.

529
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,746
- What?
- Turn off the music.

530
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,961
Twenty seconds!

531
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,875
- Turn off the damn music.
- Hold on, Marseille.

532
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,083
- Get out of the car.
- Hold on.

533
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,416
Ten seconds!

534
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,330
- Get out.
- Five seconds!

535
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,748
The burrow is open.

536
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,248
We're in.

537
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,923
OK.

538
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,915
Get out of here.

539
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,206
We're in.

540
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,746
Benjamín.

541
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:00,881
Stage three.

542
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,415
Roger that.

543
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,173
Hello.

544
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,875
M-607.

545
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:18,998
The last CCTV sighting was
at kilometer 29, the Colmenar Viejo exit.

546
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,420
Eight in the morning on the second day...
the last stage begins.

547
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,960
That's when Lisbon will leave
Soto del Real prison,

548
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,291
guarded by the same convoy
as the day before.

549
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,880
She's just left the prison.

550
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,503
Get ready.

551
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,205
Tokyo, get Gandía ready.

552
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,421
At 8:35, she'll arrive
at the National Court.

553
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,210
The entrance
will still be full of journalists.

554
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,581
They'll repeat the same procedure.

555
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,248
They'll go into the parking garage.

556
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,205
But there's one difference...

557
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,210
you will already be there.

558
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,923
But nobody will be able to see you.

559
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,420
Because overnight...

560
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
you'll have built a false wall.

561
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,881
Jeez, Louise!

562
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,918
You'll have three hours to build that wall

563
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,330
before the first National Court employees
arrive at 7:00 a.m.

564
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,745
That wall

565
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,673
will be just small enough
that no one will notice it,

566
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,253
but big enough for you to hide behind.

567
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,130
Perfect.

568
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,075
And then comes
the David Copperfield moment.

569
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:11,213
How to extract someone

570
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,961
from a van guarded by six other vehicles
and surrounded by civil guards

571
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,580
without anyone realizing.

572
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,170
How to do it so that life goes on...

573
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
as if nothing had happened.

574
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,001
For that, we need to move
the next piece on the board.

575
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,208
And it's an essential piece.

576
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,423
The time has come...
for you to decide your fate.

577
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,536
Life or death.

578
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,583
We've reconnected your equipment.

579
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,878
You'll call the tent,
you'll speak to Tamayo,

580
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,458
and you'll say you killed Nairobi.

581
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,633
Fucking son of a bitch.

582
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,210
And killed me too.

583
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,713
That we haven't found the panic room yet,

584
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,575
but that we're about to.

585
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,830
That you're going out
and that you've got a radio.

586
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,328
What's up?

587
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,381
Am I turning you on like
when I rammed the shrapnel into you?

588
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,003
Get to it.

589
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,748
Command center.

590
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,293
It's César Gandía.

591
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:54,501
Head of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

592
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,125
It's a ruse. They caught me!
They're trying to set you up!

593
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,455
Gandía...

594
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,995
it's the Professor.

595
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,916
We fully expected you to do this,

596
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,460
but that was your one chance
to get it wrong.

597
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,666
The next call will be to Tamayo.

598
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,540
- Do it again...
- Think of your son, Juanito.

599
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,535
And Tokyo will kill you.

600
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,331
You hear me, Tokyo?

601
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,495
- Loud and clear.
- Listen to me, Tokyo.

602
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:28,753
You'll hang up and you'll kill him.

603
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,245
I want you to understand one thing.

604
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,753
You can't win now.
You've already lost. Do you understand?

605
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,213
The heroic thing to do
is to see your wife and son again.

606
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,963
If not, they'll lose you.

607
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,575
They'll lose you.

608
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,083
Do you hear me, Tokyo?

609
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,670
Get to it.

610
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,580
Suárez.

611
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,285
Martínez!

612
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:10,788
Colonel!

613
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,915
It's Gandía.

614
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,456
Gandía, I'm here.

615
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,041
Colonel, I'm in the panic room.

616
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,826
They're about to find it.

617
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,076
I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.

618
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,753
I'm launching another attack.

619
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,333
I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.

620
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,633
- I want all units on alert.
- Alpha and Beta units, get ready.

621
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:35,918
- Everyone ready and on alert.
- Go.

622
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,285
Four, six, two,

623
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,075
point, six, six, two.

624
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,625
Come with us.

625
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,876
If we don't get Lisbon
when she arrives, what do we do?

626
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,578
Wait in the wall for 10 hours?

627
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:59,826
This time, it'll take her
less than 20 minutes to come back.

628
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,791
They'll insist, of course,
but she'll be within her rights.

629
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,916
I've decided not to testify.

630
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,540
Mrs. Murillo, yesterday
you seriously incriminated yourself.

631
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,920
I advise you not to backtrack.

632
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,793
You could get penal benefits.

633
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:22,455
The judge will be forced
to send her to prison.

634
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:26,921
The same guards who took her in
will take her back to the parking garage.

635
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:31,211
But no one will be watching,
because the security control room

636
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,001
will be seeing the recording
from the night before.

637
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,786
The first time Lisbon arrived.

638
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,165
And then,

639
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,040
they'll cross paths with...

640
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,921
a judge... a prosecutor...

641
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,960
a police officer...

642
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,291
and two lawyers.

643
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,376
Well, maybe you should be the prisoner.

644
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Benjamín.

645
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,133
- Everyone ready?
- Ready.

646
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,418
Now.

647
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,673
- Benjamín.
- I see her.

648
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,210
Twenty-five meters.

649
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,083
Ten meters.

650
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,213
The signal will be...

651
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
Good morning.

652
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,916
Three meters.

653
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:50,998
Good morning.

654
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,328
- Good morning, Ms. Lisbon.
- Hello.

655
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,418
Let's go.

656
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,576
We won't make it easy for them,
within 45 seconds,

657
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,626
they'll have explosives
strapped to their chests.

658
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:22,578
Within 55, two cameras and two microphones
will be watching them so that...

659
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,423
if they change the route...

660
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,420
Boom.

661
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,711
If they attempt to raise the alarm...

662
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,251
Boom.

663
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,503
If you don't drive the prisoner
back to the prison...

664
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,503
Boom.

665
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,165
Are we taking the prisoner or not?

666
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,000
We'll give them another Lisbon.

667
00:45:59,125 --> 00:45:59,955
Officers...

668
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,581
Everything OK?
You're taking a long time.

669
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,921
Yes, everything's fine.

670
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,750
- We're coming up now.
- OK, understood.

671
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,625
And that's when
the great magic trick begins.

672
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,168
The climax
of the David Copperfield show.

673
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,670
- Who is this Copperfield?
- The magician.

674
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,210
- Wasn't that Harry Potter?
- It'll seem like nothing's changed.

675
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,036
But it won't be.

676
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,460
Because we'll have someone crawling
through the tunnel at top speed.

677
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,038
Come on.

678
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,001
Come on.

679
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,171
Let's go.

680
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,381
Tokyo...

681
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,791
Lisbon is on the way.

682
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:30,245
Begin the countdown... now.

683
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,043
Run!

684
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,916
Colonel, they're shooting!

685
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,918
Gandía!

686
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,170
- Gandía, answer me.
- Gandía here.

687
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,581
Gandía here!

688
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,876
- They're closing in on me.
- They're closing in on me.

689
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:48,078
- I'm caught in the cross fire.
- Good.

690
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,538
Up you go.

691
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,131
- Where are you? Can we give cover fire?
- Negative.

692
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,538
Negative, Colonel.

693
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,455
- I'm going to the roof.
- I'm going to the roof.

694
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:03,331
- I request evacuation.
- I request evacuation!

695
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,746
Suárez, send a helicopter, now.

696
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,883
- Come on!
- Delta 1, prepare for takeoff.

697
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,998
Rescue operation at the Bank of Spain,
now!

698
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,205
Hold on, Gandía.

699
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,171
I have an M16 and 3 magazines.

700
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,630
I don't know how long I can hold out.

701
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,961
Fire. Now.

702
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,960
- They started a fire.
- They're starting a fire. I can't see!

703
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,831
Colonel.

704
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,076
Smoke on the roof.

705
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,326
Hold on. The helicopter's coming.

706
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:54,626
Lisbon.

707
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,498
- Marseille.
- Marseille.

708
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,625
We have Lisbon.

709
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,331
Switch to blanks.

710
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,963
Let's go!

711
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:29,753
Where will you get a military helicopter?

712
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,790
The same place we got the vehicles
for the heist, the black market.

713
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,875
Not only that,
we'll intercept their communications

714
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:43,168
so that when they contact the helicopter,
it'll be us who answer.

715
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,166
Where's the helicopter?

716
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,500
Delta, position.

717
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,923
Time?

718
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,750
Two minutes, fifty seconds.

719
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,503
- Two minutes, 50 seconds.
- Go to the roof. We'll cover you.

720
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,423
I can't.
There's plastic explosive on the door.

721
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,750
- For fuck's sake! Bomb disposal!
- Bomb disposal!

722
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,328
- Describe the device.
- Blue wire to the primer.

723
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,666
There's a movement sensor
and a blue wire to the primer.

724
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,286
Cut it. It's a simple device.

725
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,325
- You sure?
- Yes.

726
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,626
- No!
- Cut it.

727
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,038
No. Colonel!

728
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,038
- Wire cut.
- Wire cut!

729
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,375
Denver, now.

730
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,375
I'm in black. Don't shoot.

731
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,668
- Door.
- Exiting now.

732
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,500
I'm wearing black and a ski mask.
Hold fire.

733
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,245
Our man's in black. Cover him.

734
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,963
- Be ready for possible cross fire.
- Copy.

735
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,880
Switch to blanks.

736
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:47,958
Go!

737
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,168
Let's go!

738
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,713
They're on the roof. They're firing!

739
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,576
Cover fire!

740
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,456
There's smoke. I don't have a shot.

741
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,421
- Tokyo, now.
- Palermo?

742
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,748
Open.

743
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,330
- Searching for target.
- No visual.

744
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,173
I've got them. I see them!

745
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,670
Target in sight.

746
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,501
Permission to shoot.

747
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,751
Permission to shoot.

748
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,876
- They're shooting at us!
- Motherfuckers.

749
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,248
We're exposed.

750
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,333
- They're exposed!
- Take cover!

751
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,166
We're retreating to cover.

752
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,080
Delta, begin approach maneuver.
Rescue protocol.

753
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,416
I want a quick, clean extraction.

754
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,421
Marseille.

755
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,920
- Arriving.
- Helicopter in position.

756
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,880
- Get it down there!
- Go ahead.

757
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,041
- Permission to descend, sir!
- Proceed.

758
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,456
Back in the helicopter, now!

759
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,210
Lisbon!

760
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,921
- Denver!
- Welcome to the Bank of Spain!

761
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,380
Package delivered, Professor.
I'll be out in two minutes.

762
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,745
Where's the helicopter going?

763
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:09,043
Delta 1, what's going on?
Return to your position!

764
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,705
- Delta 1, come in!
- Fuck!

765
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,881
There's a problem with the helicopter.
We're gonna tackle them.

766
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:29,076
Where'd that agent come from?
What balls.

767
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,538
They're retreating.

768
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,415
Are you OK?

769
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,673
Yes?

770
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,543
What?

771
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,080
A call from Soto del Real.
The convoy that transferred Murillo.

772
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:05,786
I have a woman here who was kidnapped
as she left the hairdressers.

773
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,415
What do I care?
This is the command center for the heist!

774
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,750
Here, asshole.

775
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,078
Gandía, hold on!

776
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,786
Stay on the stairs
till the helicopter returns.

777
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,825
Where's the fucking helicopter?

778
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:21,705
Colonel...

779
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,540
- What?
- Colonel.

780
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,250
The situation seems to be a trick.

781
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:48,171
- Yes!
- Come on!

782
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,078
Yes!

783
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,671
Fuck yeah!

784
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,130
- Yes!
- Professor.

785
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,668
Lisbon is with us.

786
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,920
I repeat, Lisbon is with us!

787
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,825
Fuck yeah!

788
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,461
Listen to me.

789
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,246
This war...

790
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,710
We're going to win.

791
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,325
For Nairobi.

792
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,463
For Nairobi.

793
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,495
For Nairobi.

794
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,630
For Nairobi.

795
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,878
For Nairobi.

796
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,213
For Nairobi.

797
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,248
For Nairobi.

798
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,463
For Nairobi!

799
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,003
For Nairobi!

800
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,883
For Nairobi!

801
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,788
For Nairobi!

802
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,955
For Nairobi!

803
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,711
For Nairobi!

804
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,501
For Nairobi!

805
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,325
For Nairobi!

806
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,420
Don't move.

807
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,583
Checkmate, son of a bitch.
