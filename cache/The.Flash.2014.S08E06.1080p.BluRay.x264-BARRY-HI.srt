1
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:08,885
I now pronounce you
husband and wife... again.

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,095
[clapping]

3
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,357
You know, even though future you

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,985
told us about your vow renewals,
like, a million times,

5
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,529
I still got pretty weepy.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Me, too.

7
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,366
I mean, the love in this room
when you two kissed...

8
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,202
We have such an amazing future
ahead of us.

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,497
Yeah, if we didn't change it.

10
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,292
I checked with Gideon, no changes
to the timeline, everything's fine.

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,130
Well, on that note, we should be
getting back to 2049 sooner or later.

12
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,214
Yeah.

13
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,300
Keep the future safe.

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,303
You're both gonna make great heroes.

15
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,055
- I already am.
- Yes.

16
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:56,891
I will make you proud, Dad.

17
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,185
I know.

18
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,566
Love you both.

19
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,128
Okay, everything seems the same.

20
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,923
It was so good to see Uncle Jay
and Aunt Joan again.

21
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:36,180
Is it weird that seeing Uncle Jay alive
just made me miss him more?

22
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,225
[loud whooshing]

23
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:49,985
What was that?

24
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,738
[stutters] I have no idea.

25
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,032
[door opens, closes]

26
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:57,952
Okay, kids,
I come bearing cheeseburgers.

27
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,872
Who's hungry?

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,666
Uncle Jay!

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,835
You were expecting someone else?
[chuckles]

30
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,045
Bart,

31
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,923
- are you okay, son?
- No!

32
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,466
Oh, okay.

33
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:13,717
We just...

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,386
We just missed you so much.

35
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:16,637
[Jay] Aw.

36
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,238
[Bart] He's alive.

37
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,199
Uncle Jay is alive!

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,660
[chuckles] Our Uncle Jay,
he's really... Did we do this?

39
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,454
We did, didn't we?
[laughs] Oh! This is so crash.

40
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,664
Cra... No!

41
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:46,334
No, not crash, the opposite of crash.

42
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:50,088
Look, that was a temporal wave
that washed over us, okay?

43
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:54,175
That means that when we went back to
help Mom and Dad stop the Godspeed war,

44
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,510
we changed the future.

45
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,972
[Godspeeds]
Kill The Adversary and his allies.

46
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,266
Yeah, but in a good way.

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,107
Well, yeah, totally. But we have to
figure out why the change has happened.

48
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,361
So...

49
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,740
Are, um, Mom and Pops gonna be

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,118
swinging by anytime soon?

51
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,706
Aren't they in Milan for
their anniversary at La Verità Rustica?

52
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,374
- Right!
- Yes.

53
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:30,128
Yes, the anniversary
of their wedding vow renewal.

54
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,671
Mm-hmm. Um...

55
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,798
But the rest of Team Flash
could pop by, right?

56
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,094
[Jay] Well, they're all kind of busy,
which you already know.

57
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,555
Now, why the third degree?

58
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:42,723
Oh...

59
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,727
- Oh, nothing, we're fine.
- Yeah, no, we... yeah.

60
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:48,104
Bart's fine, I'm fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

61
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,815
Well, thanks to your brother.

62
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:55,695
When that psychopath Godspeed
came for me a few months ago,

63
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,905
I thought my race
might be finally finished.

64
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,491
But then, Impulse saved the day,

65
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,788
prevented Godspeed
from destroying our total reality,

66
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,833
just like your dad always does.

67
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,588
That's how I know you'll make
a great Flash one day, Bart.

68
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,763
Oh, Aunt Rose!

69
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,349
Sends her love,
her botany club's running late again.

70
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,476
Who's Aunt Rose?

71
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,562
Rose.

72
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,398
My wife?

73
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,525
[chuckles]

74
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,195
What is up with you two tonight?

75
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,997
So, that's how we did this?

76
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,128
Yeah, when we chased Godspeed
through time using the cosmic treadmill,

77
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,090
only it wasn't built to handle
the energy of three speedsters at once.

78
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,928
Our tachyon energies must have
caused massive temporal fissures.

79
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,597
Oh!

80
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,726
This is why Dad has time travel rules.

81
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,771
According to this, Uncle Jay
never married Aunt Joan.

82
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,523
- [gauntlet beeping]
- [gasps]

83
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,943
Oh, my God! We erased her.

84
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,029
We erased her.
My gauntlet just confirmed it.

85
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,032
Is that one of those fissures
that we caused?

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,286
I'm sorry, how far back does it go?
How many are there? Can we fix them?

87
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,705
[whispers] Keep your voice down.

88
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,623
[exhales deeply]

89
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:37,172
Okay, we work backwards, identifying
everything new to the timeline,

90
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,423
figure out where things
first started changing,

91
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,681
and put them back
where they're supposed to be.

92
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:42,968
Okay.

93
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,680
Corrupt Mayor Bellows Jr,

94
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,558
farther back, Trickster invades Tibet,

95
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,268
farther back...

96
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,854
- Who's Booster Gold?
- [Bart] Keep going.

97
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,484
"Zoom attacks C.C.P.D,
Chief of Police Joe West."

98
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,654
Grandpa Joe wasn't Chief then, right?

99
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,197
But he is in this new timeline.

100
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,615
When did he get promoted?

101
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,453
There are no time fissures before that.

102
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,932
This is where the change happened,

103
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,208
and it altered everything
that follows, like dominos.

104
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,253
Okay, "Detective Joe West heroically
took a bullet during a jewelry theft,

105
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,463
the afternoon of December 31st, 2013."

106
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,966
And Dad couldn't help him
because he was still in a coma.

107
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,551
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

108
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,680
If we save Grandpa Joe from getting
shot, things will return to normal,

109
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,640
and we get Aunt Joan back.

110
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,225
New Year's Eve, 2013,

111
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,893
here we come.

112
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,484
[both exhale]

113
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,644
What the hell are you wearing?

114
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:43,862
Something sexy.

115
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,196
[Bart chuckles]

116
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,158
It's smart, I'm incognito.

117
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,494
Dude, it's 2013, not 1913.

118
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,121
Look, there's Grandpa Joe.

119
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:58,294
I... I haven't done this in a long time.

120
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,629
What am I supposed to say?

121
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,256
Breathe, Detective. You got this.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,055
Hey!

123
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,390
Counselor Horton, how are you?

124
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,644
I am crappy, Detective West,
so if you don't mind, I'm just gonna...

125
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:19,815
Yeah. Sorry,
we are celebrating New Year's here...

126
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,817
Oh, God, okay,
I'm gonna stop you right there.

127
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,571
Two things. One,
I have a ton of paperwork

128
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,114
back on my desk at the DA's office

129
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,742
and two, this one's important,
pay attention.

130
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,537
All men... are jerks.

131
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,205
No offense.

132
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,208
None taken.

133
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,251
Great! Happy New Year.

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,838
Damn.

135
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,676
Sorry, Detective.

136
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,762
Then again, her divorce
just finalized last week.

137
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,013
That wasn't worth mentioning?

138
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,059
I was gonna, but it just seems like
you two would make such a great pair.

139
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,648
Is today the day that Grandpa Joe
and Grammy Cecile start dating?

140
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,856
No.

141
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,776
I mean, I don't think that it is.

142
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,488
Okay, good, because stopping
Grandpa Joe from getting shot,

143
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,156
it's enough fixing for one day.

144
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Okay.

145
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,994
Remember what we learned in 2049.

146
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,204
We have to stop what happens today,

147
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,123
and we cannot interact with anyone

148
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,500
who is connected to our family
while we are doing it.

149
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,213
Relax, no one's going to find out
who we are or why we're here.

150
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,595
Who are you two...
and why are you here?

151
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,149
Well...

152
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,567
how about it?

153
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,695
[Nora] Yes, of course.

154
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,155
Here you go, Detective.

155
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,742
Nora Moy and Bart Wade.

156
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,828
We're intern CSI's.
We are here to help out

157
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,330
because we heard that
one of your CSI's is...

158
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,634
- Under the weather.
- ...under the weather.

159
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,128
That's it, just crime fighters.

160
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:08,049
Couple of crime fighters, with science.

161
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,887
Sorry, it's been tense here
since the accident at S.T.A.R. Labs.

162
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,723
My new partner barely speaks to me.

163
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,142
Get him a cup of coffee.

164
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,229
I find the Java
really brings people together.

165
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,313
Yeah.

166
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,483
That is a great idea.

167
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,236
I want to buy the entire bullpen
coffee from the cart outside.

168
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,238
Take their orders. It's on me.

169
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,033
Maybe this will help break the ice.

170
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:39,747
Detective, we have so much science
to get done today,

171
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,957
so I don't know
if we're going to be able to...

172
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,542
- It's a lot.
- We do

173
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,837
have science,
but we are more than happy to help out,

174
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,131
and we will be back
in a flash, Detective.

175
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,644
Can you leave Detective West's
and mine on our desks while we're out?

176
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:54,804
Thanks a lot, guys.

177
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:02,561
That's the guy! That's the guy!
That's the guy that sacrificed himself

178
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,814
to stop Eobard Thawne, Mom's old fiancé.

179
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,483
- Yes, it is.
- Ow.

180
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,919
And now we are his coffee gophers,

181
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,153
when we're supposed to be
looking out for Grandpa Joe.

182
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,080
I'll take a hazelnut mocha latte.

183
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,637
This is ridiculous! Can I not just use
my superspeed instead, please?

184
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,215
What part of "don't change the timeline"
do you not understand?

185
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,343
Bart, unless we are absolutely
100% certain

186
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,720
that it won't make things worse,
we can't use our speed.

187
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,722
But... [groans]

188
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,809
Come on, Bart, I need you
to focus on the plan.

189
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,103
I have my gauntlet set to alert us

190
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,689
as soon as the jewelry robbery
goes down, okay?

191
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,274
That is where Grandpa Joe will be.

192
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,957
Right, and then we swoop in
and we save the day, that's fantastic.

193
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,046
But you do realize that every second
that we're standing here,

194
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,449
Grandpa Joe could be getting shot,
like now, or now, or right now you see...

195
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,659
Holy crap, stop!

196
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,954
No, because Grandpa Joe's safety
is on the line, and I need a coffee now!

197
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,414
Oh, I'm so sorry.

198
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,250
- I just didn't see you.
- That's called inattentional blindness.

199
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,419
It's a phenomenon when an individual...

200
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,215
- Hi.
- Hi.

201
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,967
I'm Bart.

202
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,343
And you're?

203
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,866
You're studying temporal dynam...

204
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,850
How do you know
so much about quantum divergence?

205
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,936
Well, now, that's a surprise.

206
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,248
Tell you what, can you keep a secret?

207
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,273
Oh, yeah, definitely.

208
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,109
- I'm from the future!
- No way, me, too! What year?

209
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,819
No dude, I'm totally messing with you.

210
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,613
Time travel is impossible.

211
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,531
[laughs] Yeah...

212
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,451
but it is possible though,
mathematically,

213
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,495
if I'm reading
the title of your thesis correctly.

214
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,974
Yeah, I'm trying to prove
that Tolman's paradox

215
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,583
can give rise to quantum superposition,

216
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,669
and that tachyon exchanges between
two particles can generate superposition

217
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,106
and entangle molecular pairs.
Of course, it's the causal paradox

218
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,010
- I'm still trying to solve.
- [gauntlet chimes]

219
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:59,094
Oh, my God, you're like
the Elon Musk of your generation.

220
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,140
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Elon Musk
is my generation's Elon Musk.

221
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,725
- Well, I mean...
- I'm Avery.

222
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,812
And I'm Nora, his sister, and we should
really go. We have that thing.

223
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,440
Yeah, right. Yeah, we have that...

224
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,319
Avery, your research
is bleeding edge impressive.

225
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,821
Can you tell that to my boss
at Fast Track Labs?

226
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,283
Just once, I'd like to help run research
instead of running for coffee.

227
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,868
But, that's the intern life.

228
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,512
- You know what, I'm an intern, too!
- No way!

229
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,847
- Yeah, we just got coffees...
- Yeah, actually, you know what,

230
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,832
we both are, we both are interns,
and we should really go now.

231
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,158
That call we were waiting for?

232
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,252
- Yes.
- It just came in.

233
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,251
Oh, that one.

234
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,253
Um...

235
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,381
Yeah, it was really crash meeting you.

236
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,817
Is that a good thing?
If it's a good thing and you want to run

237
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,052
into me again, I make a coffee run
every afternoon.

238
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,529
That's good to know. Nice to meet you.

239
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,846
- This is you...
- Thank you.

240
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,306
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

241
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,392
Bye. [clears throat]

242
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,145
- [alarm blaring]
- [siren wailing]

243
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,694
You watch the back entrance,
I'll watch the front.

244
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,819
Backup's en route.

245
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,326
- [Joe] Drop your weapon!
- [exclaims] Freeze!

246
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,537
Hey! This is a real gun.

247
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,789
Real bullets inside!

248
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,668
Kid, have you ever even
held a gun before?

249
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,045
Yes. This isn't my first heist.

250
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,757
Listen, most thieves don't wear
what they just stole.

251
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,304
Yeah, I forgot a bag, all right?

252
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,347
Hey, listen, I am only taking

253
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,142
the ethically sourced
conflict-free diamonds.

254
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,811
No blood diamonds for me. No, sir.

255
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,981
Listen, lower your weapon
before you have an accident.

256
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,233
Why don't you lower your weapon?

257
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,195
Stop!

258
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,717
If Grandpa Joe
was never supposed to be here,

259
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,581
then the gun was never
supposed to fire at all.

260
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,304
We can't cause another temporal flux.

261
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,638
Okay, you're just now mentioning that.

262
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,307
Well, I tried to
when we were in the coffee line,

263
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,391
but someone was too busy flirting.

264
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,208
- What do we do?
- Okay, um...

265
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,128
We need to examine our variables,
and we need to form a plan.

266
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,964
- First we need to consider...
- Oh, my God, I've got this!

267
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:25,948
[exclaims]

268
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,701
I am so sorry.

269
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,804
Those things are way heavier
than they look in the movies.

270
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,222
Turn around, hands behind your back.

271
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,207
- That was an accident.
- Hands behind your back!

272
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
I heard a shot.

273
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,835
- Are you...
- I'm fine, Detective.

274
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,919
- [siren wailing]
- You must have a guardian angel.

275
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,175
[groans] You shouldn't have done that.

276
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,052
So I moved Grandpa Joe
instead of the bullet.

277
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,595
- What's the big deal?
- This.

278
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,767
Look, now, more temporal particles
are in flux.

279
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,186
Bart, you made everything worse.

280
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,978
[sighs in exasperation]

281
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,240
[Bart] I don't even get it. [echoes]

282
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,993
He wasn't even a meta-human with powers.
[echoes]

283
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,830
[Nora] Well, now more metas are gonna be
turning up everywhere

284
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,582
now that the particle accelerator
exploded... [echoes]

285
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,959
Meta-human?

286
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,045
Then I'm not alone.

287
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,475
Bart, the whole timeline's in flux.

288
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,644
You might have changed the future
even more now.

289
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,872
[stutters] What did I do?
I saved Grandpa.

290
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,149
By moving Grandpa Joe
instead of moving the bullet,

291
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,235
you created a new series of events
changing the timeline.

292
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,755
It's what I would have warned you about
if you hadn't rushed in.

293
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,799
Okay, okay. Why don't we just go back
in time 15 minutes

294
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,992
and see for ourselves what we did wrong?

295
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,787
Oh, okay. So you want to
fix our time travel screw ups

296
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,372
by traveling back in time.

297
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,457
Again.

298
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,025
Well, when you say it like that...

299
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:04,423
Actually, there is a way
to observe the past without altering it.

300
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,176
I bet you that's the flash drive

301
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,862
with the surveillance footage
from the shooting.

302
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,286
- All we have to do is watch it...
- And see what went wrong.

303
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,682
Okay, follow my lead.

304
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,267
Don't go rogue.

305
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,439
Excuse me, Detective Thawne.

306
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,734
Is that the surveillance footage
of the incident?

307
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,862
The interns. Yes, it is. Why?

308
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,448
Hi, by the way.
We just figured you're doing

309
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,718
so much detecting around here
that we could just take this

310
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,118
back to the to the police station.

311
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,322
- And then we'll just give it back to...
- No, thanks.

312
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,682
You two should make another coffee run.

313
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,042
We already did that.

314
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,293
Did you?

315
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,713
Then why am I not holding
a decaf cappuccino?

316
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,675
Let us do this work
and you two do yours.

317
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,470
- Right away, Detective.
- Yeah, right away.

318
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,874
- We got to get that footage.
- We got to get that footage.

319
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,184
[Wanda] Let me get this straight.

320
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,311
Nobody knows
why the three of us are here.

321
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,146
Feels like we've been set up.

322
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,900
So, a woman's voice is in our heads.

323
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,069
Telling us all there's a job tonight.

324
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:12,199
Now, if you two jokers didn't promise
a score... who did?

325
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,158
[Mona laughs]

326
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,869
<i>Me, big fella.</i>

327
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,912
<i>Pool table.</i>

328
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:27,339
<i>Utopia Casino's ringing in the New Year
with the biggest fête in town.</i>

329
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,094
<i>More guests means more bets
means more cash they'll need to cover.</i>

330
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,638
<i>They'll have ten mil in the vault, easy.</i>

331
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,390
Not the worst plan.

332
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,102
But the party starts in six hours.
There's no prep time.

333
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,145
What if the cops show?

334
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,319
[Mona]
<i>I'll know they're coming before they do.</i>

335
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,859
<i>'Cause ever since
that Particle Accelerator exploded,</i>

336
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:51,071
<i>I can hear people's thoughts.</i>

337
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,365
<i>Now, I thought I was the only one
with gifts.</i>

338
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,701
<i>Until I learned a new word.</i>

339
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,495
Meta-human.

340
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,498
[chuckles]

341
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,751
It means we're all something more now.

342
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,795
Something greater.

343
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,590
And I am done living in fear.

344
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:11,800
Now, who's game?

345
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,888
I'm sick of hiding who I am.

346
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,935
So am I.

347
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,485
Watch it, Jack.

348
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,780
[laughs] See? Doesn't that feel better?

349
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,283
And with our powers, no one can stop us.

350
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,328
And if they try, I'll know what they're
planning before they even think it.

351
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,663
So you're the ace up our sleeve.

352
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,499
No. She's a queen.

353
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,811
[Bart] How are we gonna get that
flash drive without Grandpa noticing?

354
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,388
Watch, okay?

355
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,890
And learn.

356
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,893
Okay. I get it.

357
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,645
I'm the new guy.

358
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,145
You're busy.

359
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:10,108
And I heard you just lost your partner,
which has got to be tough.

360
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,987
Plus, one of our CSI's in a coma.
Then on top of all that,

361
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,114
you get shot down by Counselor Horton.

362
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,491
Who told you that?

363
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:18,908
Uh...

364
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,702
Everyone?

365
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,707
[Nora]
You could try lilacs and crumb cake.

366
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,376
Those are her favorites.

367
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,296
[Joe] That's good advice.

368
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,927
- Who was that?
- One of our new interns.

369
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,680
They're a little weird.

370
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,021
[Nora] Okay.
Now we can see where we messed up.

371
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,981
This is where it happened.

372
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,736
Where Dad was struck by lightning.

373
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,697
[thunder crashes]

374
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,047
[Nora] I got it.

375
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,137
Ooh! Super speedy save.

376
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,932
But hang on, I know her.

377
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,311
Oh, my God. That's Mona Taylor...

378
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,649
aka The Queen. As in the telepathic
leader of the Royal Flush Gang.

379
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,942
What is she doing here?

380
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,072
[Nora] Since when is there
a casino heist tonight?

381
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,993
The RFG didn't team up
until way after Dad put the suit on.

382
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,163
After Mona discovered
that there are other metas.

383
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,373
How could she possibly even know that
this soon?

384
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:55,130
Oh, Bart, she got the idea
to form the RFG years early from us.

385
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,133
And now 30 people
are going to die from a bomb.

386
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:02,179
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to stop that heist.

387
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,930
Do you think I don't know that?

388
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,934
But if we start screwing with it again,
we could screw things up even worse.

389
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,519
What are we supposed to do then?

390
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,771
I don't know.

391
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,356
But we'll figure it out
just like we always do.

392
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,317
Dad would have gotten it right
the first time.

393
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,409
- Bart, don't go there.
- Why not?

394
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,079
- It's true.
- Listen to me.

395
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,916
Whatever happened,
it's both of our faults.

396
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,502
- We are in this together.
- Well, maybe we shouldn't be.

397
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,550
Every single thing I did today...

398
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,762
made everything worse.

399
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:50,852
I am not good enough.

400
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,857
And I will never be The Flash.

401
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,526
[thunder rumbling]

402
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,612
[whooshes]

403
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,076
[sighs]

404
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,208
[EKG beeping steadily]

405
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,673
Spoiler alert, Pops.

406
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,300
Your son's a big screw up.

407
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,187
- I knew you'd be here.
- I let him down, sis.

408
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,149
- Bart, listen to me. Nobody is perfect.
- You are.

409
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,193
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

410
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,737
You knew when to come back here.

411
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,991
You got the flash drive.

412
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,452
You even helped Grandpa Joe
and Grammie Cecile. You...

413
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,705
Yeah, you're perfect.

414
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,503
I'm a complete failure.

415
00:22:58,962 --> 00:22:59,962
No.

416
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,259
No, you're not. I failed a lot, too.

417
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:09,264
For a long time, I fumbled
with my powers. I doubted myself.

418
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,975
But that's how we learn.

419
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,395
And yeah, every time I fell...

420
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,647
Dad picked me up.

421
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,402
Just like every time you fall,
I am going to pick you up, too.

422
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,324
Just remember what Dad always says.

423
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:32,329
"No matter how fast you run,
life is about the journey."

424
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,417
Bart, we are going to make this right.

425
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,421
It just takes time
to think things through.

426
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:47,968
[sniffles]

427
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,478
Thank you for the pep talk, sis.

428
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,321
And now I'm thinking,
to get out of this...

429
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,908
we're gonna need an expert
in time travel.

430
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,118
And I know just where to go.

431
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,708
[reporter] <i>The rain

00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,266
How did you get in here?

436
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,771
This place has a $12 million
security system and armed guards.

437
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,357
Hi, again.
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

438
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,520
We actually need your help.

439
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,544
It's regarding your theory
on temporal development.

440
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,028
Holy crap!

441
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,865
That, that, that whole getting coffee
while bumping into me in line,

442
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,116
that wasn't an accident.

443
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,037
It's classic espionage trick.
You were following me.

444
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,162
Ha ha!

445
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,917
And now you want to take me hostage
and steal all of Fast Track Lab's

446
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,921
corporate secrets. Well, do your worst,
'cause I'm not talking.

447
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,424
No. Avery, we're not going to hurt you.

448
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,051
We need your help to stop a crime.

449
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,470
Right. Why should I believe you?

450
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,739
Because we're time travelers
from the future

451
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,032
and we need you to show us
how your temporal theory

452
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,535
can help save people at a casino robbery
without actually changing the timeline.

453
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,560
Wow, that felt so good.

454
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,731
- I'm calling security.
- No, wait! We can prove it.

455
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:25,400
I could show you something
about your past or your future.

456
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,961
[Bart] But if you show her something
from the future,

457
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,422
she's going to have to wait until
it happens to actually prove anything.

458
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,782
Is that gauntlet using
integrated quantum circuitry?

459
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,784
- Yes.
- Last I checked, yeah.

AI nano cells.

462
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,793
This is decades away.

463
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,716
You guys are from the future.

464
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,178
We are. Which is why we need your help.

465
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,973
Ever since we arrived,
we've caused serious temporal shifts.

466
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,558
And now...

467
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,561
Thirty people are going to die.

468
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,147
It might be worse than you think.

469
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,566
The death toll keeps changing,
but the headline doesn't.

470
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:11,279
Because now it's solidified
into a fixed point in time...

471
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,407
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

472
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:20,121
...and that means that the heist
and the deaths aren't causally entangled

473
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,248
like the tachyon particle exchange
in my theory.

474
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,375
Which is looking more like fact.

475
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,964
It's too late to stop the casino heist.

476
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,426
But since the casualties keep changing,
they're not fixed in time.

477
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:37,013
So you can fix the timeline
and save all those people.

478
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,141
As long as you let
the heist still happen.

479
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:41,892
Wow.

480
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,104
- Okay. Thanks, Avery.
- Hold on.

481
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,438
I'm coming with you.

482
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,399
Avery, we can't risk you getting hurt.

483
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,569
But we will come back.

484
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,114
I promise you.

485
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,891
Ladies and gents!

486
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,142
[honking]

487
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,272
I say it's high time we rang in
the New Year...

488
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,117
[Mona speaks telepathically]
<i>...with a bang.</i>

489
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,081
Well, here's the drill, folks.

490
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,043
If you run, call for help or annoy us,

491
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,672
my... ooh, king...

492
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,633
will pop your skulls
with his bare hands.

493
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,511
So, please don't make him kill you.

494
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,680
Find the casino vault.

495
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,474
- Empty it.
- Done and doner.

496
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,976
And if we run into trouble?

497
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,519
Show them a winning hand.

498
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,616
Okay. Remember, you need to get
everyone to safety while I find the bomb

499
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,702
- and make sure...
- Let the heist happen.

500
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:23,785
Yeah.

501
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,206
Stay calm, Bart. You got this.

502
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,750
We got this.

503
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,559
Four minutes to midnight.

504
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,653
My queen, a couple was sitting
right there being quiet,

505
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,488
so I turned my back on them
for a minute.

506
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,198
Now they're missing.

507
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,827
Someone is inside here with us.

508
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,297
[Mona speaks telepathically]
<i>Whoever you are, show yourself.</i>

509
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,384
<i>Or my king starts popping heads.</i>

510
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,095
[woman whimpering]

511
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,389
[Nora] <i>Bart, I can't find the bomb.</i>

512
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,200
The Queen is going to start
killing people

513
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:27,809
unless I do something right now.

514
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,771
What? No, no.
You have to get everyone to safety.

515
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,106
No, time for plan B.

516
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,858
Just get the bomb before midnight.

517
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,944
There is no plan B.

518
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,528
Bart!

519
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:41,071
Bart!

520
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,411
[Mona speaks telepathically]
<i>Last chance.</i>

[woman screams]

522
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,541
Wait! Wait!

523
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,626
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Okay.

524
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,129
Let's all just... Let's just relax.

525
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,089
Okay? No need to lose our heads.

526
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,678
I am the casino manager, obviously.

527
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,181
Isaac is my name and you caught me.

528
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,101
I am the one that was helping
the customers escape.

529
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,104
But I am not doing that anymore.
I'm not going to do that anymore.

530
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,438
Um...

531
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,901
However, since dead people
aren't great for business,

532
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,446
how about I just look away?

533
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,490
You guys just take the money and leave.

534
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:25,782
Too late.

535
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:32,373
Tell me, what kind of casino manager
risks his neck on minimum wage?

536
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,668
One who's a really great employee.

537
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,422
Oh. Or you're a cop. Hmm?

538
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,634
Let's see what's inside
that beautiful mind of yours.

539
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:47,972
[Bart] <i>No, no, no, no.</i>

540
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,867
<i>We've gotta fix this timeline,
to get back to this timeline... Future.</i>

541
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,769
Wait. You're from the future?

542
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,191
[Bart thinking] <i>She's so cute.</i>

543
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,193
<i>Please let her not have a boyfriend.</i>

544
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,863
<i>Avery, you're my future. My future.</i>

545
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,283
Oh! [laughs]

546
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,035
That future.

547
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,663
Yeah, well... Love is grand.

548
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,376
Fine. Sit down.

549
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:28,346
Success, Mona. I mean, my queen.

550
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,057
Ten million dollars' worth, too.

551
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,392
Well, then we're done here.

552
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,310
Wait!

553
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,898
My king, my dear, drop the cop.

554
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,150
Drop the... Hey, wait!

555
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,648
- [groans softly]
- [Mona] Oh.

556
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,867
If you want to survive, don't follow us.

557
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,202
Just sit down. Stay put.

558
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,121
Enjoy the fireworks. All of them.

559
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:54,622
[Mona laughs] All of them.

560
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,083
[groans]

561
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,672
Sis, the RFG's MIA.

[grunts]

564
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,220
It's almost midnight.

[timer ticking]

566
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,224
Bart, I found the bomb.

567
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,101
It's counting down to midnight.

568
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,479
But one thermal charge
couldn't level this whole building.

569
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,566
Before she left, the queen said,
"Enjoy the fireworks, all of them."

570
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,359
- [winces]
- Schrap.

571
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,236
There's more than one bomb.

572
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,029
We only have, like, 30 seconds.

573
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,757
Well, King knocked the hell out of me
and broke my arm.

574
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,491
I'm gonna need three minutes
to speed heal.

575
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,760
I can't get everyone out in time.

576
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,286
But we don't even have one minute.

577
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,789
It's okay, sis, you've got this.

578
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,142
You can find the rest of them.

579
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,084
But it took me forever to find this one.

580
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:41,919
Sis, you got this.

581
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,630
Think, think, think, think.

582
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,381
[gasps]

583
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,342
The heat signatures in the water tanks.

584
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,095
They must be masking
the bomb's thermal signature.

585
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,890
There it is. Intels are your thing,
sis, get excessive.

586
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,393
[whooshing]

587
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:02,398
Sis, it's almost midnight.

588
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,108
I know. I got them.

589
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:05,526
There were five.

590
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,278
You've got 15 seconds
to get rid of them.

591
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,113
- Where?
- [Bart] <i>Anywhere.</i>

[Bart] <i>Greatjob, sis. You did it.</i>

00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,402
[Nora] <i>We both did it.</i>

597

[fireworks whistling]

598
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:10,466
Every witness to the casino robbery
says someone streaked them outside.

599
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,510
What do you think?

600
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,886
Too much champagne?

601
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,049
It beats the hell out of me.

602
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,897
But it looks like we're here
for a long night.

603
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,519
Well, a few Jitters goodies might help.

604
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,855
- Oh! Thank you, baby girl.
- Yeah.

605
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,192
Here's to 2014 not being so weird.

606
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,111
Not being so weird.

607
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:37,952
Hey, uh, you saved my dissertation,
right? Detective Pretty Boy?

608
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:39,661
[chuckles]

609
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:41,413
Sorry.

610
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,292
That's just what my dad calls you.

611
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,688
Although, I mean, he's not wrong.

612
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:53,926
You are a boy and you are pretty.
And, uh, that did not come out right.

613
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:59,015
I'll take any compliment I can get
from Joe West.

614
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,893
Or his lovely daughter.

615
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,814
Yeah. Um...

616
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,941
Well, do you have a name, Detective?

617
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,192
It's Eddie.

618
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,531
[chuckles]

619
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,492
Okay.

620
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:27,627
Counselor Horton, you don't have
anywhere more fun to be tonight?

621
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:33,549
Uh, yeah. I had to get an evidentiary
disclosure over to Judge Hankerson.

622
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:40,264
Um, so, look, about this morning,

623
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,560
I'm so sorry if I came off
a little harsh.

624
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,747
See, it turns out that being a lawyer

625
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,148
does not make getting divorced
any easier.

626
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:50,982
It's okay.

627
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:56,322
I know that splitting up
can be hard. Trust me.

628
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,910
Yeah. So when we bumped
into each other this morning,

629
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:04,789
I know that you were about to
ask me something.

630
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:10,378
But I'm not ready.

631
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:14,507
And I'm not going to be,
not for a while.

632
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,177
Of course, I understand.

633
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,178
Yup.

634
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:25,184
However, when I am ready,

635
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,605
whoever sent lilacs
to my office tonight,

636
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,273
ooh...

637
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,403
he'll be the first one to know.

638
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,079
Okay, so we stopped the shooting.

639
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:49,375
We fixed the timeline, and we fixed the
mistakes we made fixing the timeline.

640
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,458
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

641
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:51,752
Time to head back home.

642
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,754
Interns, you getting in on this?

643
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,318
[woman] All right, everybody, line up.

644
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,177
Tall guys in the back.

645
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,621
[woman] Joe, you get in the front.

646
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,265
Happy New Year.

647
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,474
[Nora] Nope. Mm-mmm.

648
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:08,686
[timer beeping]

649
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,271
Okay, just one photo.

650
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,148
[woman] Okay, smile everyone.

651
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,941
[timer continues beeping]

652
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,235
[camera flash clicks]

653
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,240
[fireworks exploding]

654
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,121
- I'm really glad you came back.
- Me, too.

655
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:32,460
Seriously. You haven't
just changed my research.

656
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,880
You changed my life.

657
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,841
Well, I always keep my promises.

658
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:41,927
I had to. You...

659
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,848
You helped save the day with
all your science bad-assery. I mean...

660
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:50,394
Which is why I...

661
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,235
Look, Avery,
before I go back to my time,

662
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:03,657
I know we just met,
but it's New Year's Eve, right?

663
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,075
And I just think that...

664
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:23,968
Bart!

665
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,930
Bart, It's been two minutes.

666
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,723
Come on. We really have to go.

667
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,353
See you again sometime, McFly?

668
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,732
I promise.

669
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,111
All right.

670
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,154
Here we go.

671
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:11,475
Wait. So I was dead? Killed by Godspeed?

672
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:14,645
Uncle Jay. I'm so sorry
for screwing up the timeline.

673
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,899
And if that means
I can't ever be The Flash...

674
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,444
I understand.

675
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,865
[laughs]

676
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,200
I'm sorry. Are you kidding me?

677
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,828
If screwing up the timeline
was a deal breaker,

678
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,788
your dad couldn't be The Flash.

679
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,416
Heck, when I first started
to time travel,

680
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,544
I ended up fighting Nazis
in World War Il.

681
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,007
And then lived on and off
in the past for 16 years.

682
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,302
But that was another lifetime.

683
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,889
So, you're not mad?

684
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:52,474
I'm alive.

685
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,685
Right? My Joan is back.

686
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,520
Why would I be mad?

687
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,107
Bart, you're on a journey.

688
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,442
Both of you.

689
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:09,033
You're going to make mistakes,
and sometimes, they can't be undone.

690
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:15,247
But you can always try
to make things better.

691
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,206
Right?

692
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,294
And that's what you did today.

693
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,759
Now, I got to get out of here.

694
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:29,428
I've got an important meeting
with President Luthor.

695
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,324
- President Luthor?
- President Luthor?

696
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:34,350
Gotcha.

697
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,020
Oh! [laughs in relief]

698
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,737
[Joe] Iris!

699
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,030
Come on!

700
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,824
This brunch reservation
ain't gonna get any later.

701
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:52,748
Joe, don't worry.
I'll make sure we're on time.

702
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,996
After surviving Armageddon,
we all deserve this.

703
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,124
Hey, you guys got
any resolutions for 2022?

704
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:04,254
I decided to forgive Mark
for all of his crime things.

705
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,216
What? He's turned over a new leaf

706
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,541
and I made him swear
to stay on the straight and narrow.

707
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,846
Anybody know anything
about Caity's new boyfriend?

708
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,099
Marcus? Anybody met him?

709
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:17,935
- No.
- No, I hear he's really cute, though.

710
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,688
I have a resolution, actually,
party less.

711
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
I know mine.

712
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:26,234
More family time.

713
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,320
That sounds like a perfect year.

714
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,656
All right, people, let's hurry it up.

715
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,408
Look at the face. Joe's getting hangry.

716
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,034
Okay, everybody, hold hands.

717
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,118
Bundle up.

718
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,497
- It's chilly in Paris.
- [squeals excitedly]
