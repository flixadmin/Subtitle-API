1
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,879
Bastard.

2
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,983
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss too.

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,722
This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

4
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,493
That's true, but if someone's going
to beat him, it's this guy.

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,906
Tell me something. Are you a pussy?

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,342
Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,424
- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

8
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,959
Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

9
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,940
Oh, shit!

10
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,913
All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,053
Eighty. I'm missing 20.

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,119
Looks like you won some money, eh?

13
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,324
Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

14
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,661
Very good, son.

15
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,430
- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

16
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,802
Hey.

17
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,675
Do you know why you won?

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,349
That little trick. The same one, right?

19
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,317
Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

20
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,512
Why?

21
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,115
Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn. You understand?

22
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:43,493
What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

23
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,532
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why?

24
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,294
- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

25
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,635
- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

26
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,203
No, no, no, no. You go over there.
Over there, motherfucker.

27
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,940
Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin.

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,609
It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

29
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,519
- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

30
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,894
Look how they left this place.

31
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,569
We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.

32
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,135
Did anybody see anything?

33
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,576
We're sending spotters out, but
they either come back with nothing or...

34
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,379
- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

35
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,417
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

36
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,062
But she couldn't do this alone.
No fucking way.

37
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,497
The guys that came at me
had high-end weapons.

38
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,229
Big ones.

39
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,266
Gringo shit.

40
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,873
The Cali cartel.

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,712
I fucking know it.

42
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,186
Those sons of bitches will regret it.

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:23,253
I will personally burn that fucking city
to the ground.

44
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,853
We don't know that Pablo.

45
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,698
Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

46
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,209
Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,242
And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

48
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,919
Put the word out. We're going to kill
all the bastards who did this.

49
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,463
I know I hit one of them.

50
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,999
Let's hope he's still breathing.

51
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,568
Because then...

52
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:11,340
we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

53
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,180
<i>Colombia is a Catholic country,
so Christmas is a big deal.</i>

54
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,452
<i>But the people of Medellín
always take it to the next level.</i>

55
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:10,462
<i>And despite the manhunt for Pablo going on
around them, this year was no different.</i>

56
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,193
<i>Cali it faith, optimism, or stubbornness,</i>

57
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,635
<i>the people of Medellín thought
they'd seen it all, but they hadn't.</i>

58
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,263
<i>In fact, they hadn't seen anything yet.</i>

59
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,607
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

60
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,212
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

61
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,986
<i>Medellín was about to get a show
they would never forget.</i>

62
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,389
Good day.

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,990
In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as Los Pepes,

64
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,660
an acronym for
People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.

65
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,568
Or People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar,

66
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,338
the vigilantes waging war on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.

67
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:03,611
Mr. President, the media
is asking for a comment on Los Pepes.

68
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,584
It's only a matter of time
before it's made public.

69
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,519
Acknowledgment isn't the same
as condemning.

70
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:14,025
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

71
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,994
They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

72
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,694
- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

73
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,132
Gentlemen!

74
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,806
Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.

75
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,780
We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

76
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,115
But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

77
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,319
I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

78
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:49,329
Communications picked up
conversations in the Manrique district

79
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:54,891
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
sicarios, and his mother, who is ill.

80
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,835
We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

81
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,634
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

82
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,144
One more thing.

83
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,738
I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellín,

84
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,749
combating Escobar, Los Pepes.

85
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,341
Let me be very clear.

86
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:21,859
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

87
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,726
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

88
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,491
Dismissed, thank you.

89
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,101
So Los Pepes
is an interesting new wrinkle.

90
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,607
Well, are you surprised?
Escobar's got a lot of enemies.

91
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,576
I heard from Messina this morning.
There's a lot of eyes on them and us,

92
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,205
so she wants us to steer clear.

93
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,410
- Are you working for Los Pepes, Murphy?
- No, I'm not.

94
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,579
Then I guess we're good.

95
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,573
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

96
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,413
They picked up chatter
from Jairo's mom here and here.

97
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,284
Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

98
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,450
Which could take days.

99
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,929
Even longer for them to find the house.

100
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:38,134
I think Jairo is planning a homecoming.

101
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,300
Maybe even today.

102
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,079
I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

103
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,589
- Hello?
- Listen up, Carlos.

104
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,820
I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

105
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,589
<i>For Los Pepes, it was easy.</i>

106
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,496
<i>They had all the man-on-the-street
intelligence they needed.</i>

107
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,264
<i>If they heard a guy, take Jairo
for example, was in a certain vicinity,</i>

108
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,829
<i>they just asked around and they find them.</i>

109
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,342
<i>But for us, well,
we had to go door-to-door,</i>

110
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,708
<i>asking for help from people
who don't tell cops shit.</i>

111
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,441
- Police. Can you open up?
- What do you need?

112
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,041
Open up. Hurry. Hurry.

113
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,110
<i>Los Pepes, on the other hand,
had no problems.</i>

114
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,122
<i>They were quite persuasive.</i>

115
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,285
<i>Sure, once in a while,
we got lucky and picked somebody up.</i>

116
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,660
<i>But it was rarely the guy
we were looking for.</i>

117
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,134
Shh! Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

118
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,398
Don't touch her!

119
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,734
Relax, mother, relax.

120
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,304
<i>It was slow-going.</i>

121
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,244
If you don't cooperate,
we can't find your son.

122
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,180
But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

123
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,548
Do you have enemies here
in the neighborhood?

124
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,587
I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

125
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,054
He came to see his mother...

126
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,592
We're too late. Says they already got him.

127
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,866
We finally get corroboration on Jairo,
Martinez orders the raid...

128
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,873
So?

129
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,841
Well, so, how does Los Pepes
get here first?

130
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,006
Maybe he got followed.

131
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,450
Or the dumb fuck shot his mouth off
and somebody else got lucky.

132
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,351
That's it?
That's all you got to say on that?

133
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,621
Yeah.

134
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,461
If it worries you, look into it.

135
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,457
<i>Look into it? Right.</i>

136
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:53,370
<i>Nobody was looking into it.
Why would they?</i>

137
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,534
<i>Pablo's crew was turning up dead
all over Medellín,</i>

138
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,873
<i>and Jairo became the latest victim.</i>

139
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,312
<i>The terror that Pablo had spread
across the country</i>

140
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:05,976
<i>was finally back on him tenfold.
Los Pepes' method was working.</i>

141
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,417
<i>And you better believe
it was getting to Escobar.</i>

142
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,115
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

143
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,487
What did you ask Santa for?

144
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,253
- A game.
- Which one?

145
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,661
- The Joker game.
- You think he'll bring it to you?

146
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,993
Dad?

147
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,068
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

148
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,734
Dad? Dad?

149
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,467
Pablo, my love?

150
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,171
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

151
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,270
Christmas without Christ.

152
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,915
Pablo.

153
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,617
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

154
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,956
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

155
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,519
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights, Pablo.

156
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,758
The children are staying here
and so are you.

157
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,096
Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

158
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,763
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellín?

159
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,136
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

160
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,301
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

161
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,346
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

162
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,538
Don Pablo.

163
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,890
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

164
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,722
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

165
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,224
Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

166
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,327
Thank you.

167
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,963
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

168
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,403
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

169
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,910
How's it going, my love?

170
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,811
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

171
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,683
- Look, there's two.
- The Lloredas always treat us well...

172
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,987
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN

173
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,230
As gratifying as these displays may feel,

174
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,924
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

175
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,366
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

176
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:08,101
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

177
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,697
Without a doubt.

178
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,917
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

179
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,182
What about Miami?

180
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,622
We buy time.

181
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,355
Let him think he still has control.

182
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,963
Until the moment we take it from him.

183
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,572
- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

184
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,482
Centra Spike
give us anything good for Christmas?

185
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,316
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

186
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,656
The son of a bitch has got a girlfriend.

187
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,954
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

188
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,794
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

189
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,913
What do you have for me?

190
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,311
I got something new.

191
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,915
- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

192
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,854
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

193
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,655
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

194
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,421
It's done.

195
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,258
<i>I didn't know how Los Pepes
was beating us to the punch.</i>

196
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,428
<i>Not yet anyway.
What I did know was that if Search Bloc</i>

197
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,473
<i>was gonna have any kind of impact
on the hunt for Pablo,</i>

198
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,769
<i>we'd have to play the game
better and faster.</i>

199
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,471
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

200
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,876
According to Centra Spike,

201
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,780
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

202
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,478
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

203
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,351
Intel says she's pregnant.

204
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,356
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

205
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,723
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

206
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,660
Blackie's gonna show.

207
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,530
Los Pepes keeps getting the jump on us,
sicarios are gonna keep winding up dead.

208
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,500
This way, we get to Blackie first,

209
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,470
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

210
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:29,080
Well, we could set up a perimeter.
No one walks in or out.

211
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,047
Collapse that perimeter house by house.

212
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,312
- Yeah.
- Sounds good to me.

213
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,888
Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.
Carmelita, help me please.

214
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,518
Don't fight with me anymore.

215
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,054
First, relax.

216
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,065
That's harmful for you and the baby.

217
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,535
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

218
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,901
I'll find more later.

219
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,270
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

220
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,276
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

221
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,676
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

222
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,615
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

223
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,210
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

224
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,119
She's stubborn.

225
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,758
- Hey!
- Hey.

226
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,019
What's going on?

227
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,892
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

228
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,363
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

229
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,401
Goddamn Christmas miracle.

230
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,255
Post three is in position.

231
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,783
Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.

232
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,064
Wait, Javier.

233
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,637
We're moving in. Let's go.

234
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,583
Talk to me. We're just getting here.

235
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,353
Copy that, we're leaving now.

236
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,791
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

237
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,355
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

238
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,203
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

239
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,537
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

240
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,007
Let him through.

241
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,986
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

242
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,683
Let him through.

243
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,891
Good evening, what can I do for you?

244
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,973
Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

245
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,838
Of course, with pleasure.

246
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,474
How's this for an ID?

247
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,050
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

248
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,091
Quickly.

249
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,759
Boy, come over here.

250
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:37,427
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

251
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,664
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

252
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,900
That's correct, sir.

253
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,769
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

254
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,370
All units to position 20. Move!

255
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,576
- What's going on?
- Some shit's going down at checkpoint.

256
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,948
My love, you have to take the money.

257
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,858
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

258
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,954
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

259
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:11,463
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

260
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,365
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

261
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,270
Relax, relax.

262
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,573
Want to see my ID?

263
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,143
- Take it out slowly.
- Okay.

264
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,661
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

265
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,736
Do me a favor.

266
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,570
Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

267
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,974
What the fuck is this?

268
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,112
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

269
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,582
Relax! Relax! Relax! Relax!

270
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,414
Disarm. Disarm!

271
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,078
- No, you disarm!
- Sir...

272
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,316
Lower your firearm!

273
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,787
Put the fucking gun down!
Easy! Easy!

274
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,523
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

275
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,362
Bravo!

276
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:18,164
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

277
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,295
But let us do the fucking job.

278
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,270
What? You want to
kill each other at a checkpoint?

279
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,940
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

280
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,284
Lower it.

281
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,791
Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

282
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,322
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,130
Okay. Let's go home alive.

284
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,034
- Okay?
- Okay...

285
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,468
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

286
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,533
Well then, thank you.

287
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,488
Trying to avoid a bloodbath, brother.

288
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,496
What happened? Everything okay? Yes?

289
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,933
Yes, sir.

290
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,095
Miss, we need your cooperation.

291
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,240
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

292
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,036
I told you. I haven't seen him.

293
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,340
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

294
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,211
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

295
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,881
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

296
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,421
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

297
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,923
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

298
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,720
So please leave my house.

299
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,922
They were eight, maybe ten.

300
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,364
How did they take your firearm?

301
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,967
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

302
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:09,240
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

303
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,578
It's easier.

304
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:30,798
When were you gonna tell me
about your new friend Carlos Castaño?

305
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:40,845
He's not a friend, he's a...
he's a man with a shared interest.

306
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,313
Jesus Christ.
I hope you know what you're doing.

307
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,645
Don't worry.
It's not gonna blow back on you.

308
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,186
- No, it's not me I'm worried about.
- I can handle it.

309
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,948
These aren't the guys
you wanna be messing with.

310
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,655
They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

311
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:03,931
At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

312
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,796
- Make sure it doesn't go too far.
- So that doesn't go too far?

313
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,343
The good guys, they got guns
pointing at their fucking head...

314
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,469
- And the bad guys get away with it?
- Who are the good guys, Steve?

315
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,440
That's us?

316
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,656
Mr. President, these men, the Castaños,

317
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,064
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

318
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:40,037
Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.

319
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,733
And it will get even worse.

320
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,469
Colonel, I understand your concern.

321
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,174
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

322
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,809
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

323
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,412
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

324
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,149
with regard to Los Pepes.

325
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:04,560
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

326
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:09,931
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

327
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,367
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

328
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,497
It's our priority.

329
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,066
I understand. Thank you, sir.

330
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,451
<i>Los Pepes may have
seemed to be running the board,</i>

331
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,920
<i>but Escobar still had a trick or two
up his sleeve.</i>

332
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,356
<i>Remember I told you Ricardo Prisco
was a licensed doctor?</i>

333
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,018
<i>Well, he was.</i>

334
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:39,793
<i>And as such, he had privileges
at just about every hospital in Medellín.</i>

335
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,596
<i>Including the one where the Los Pepes
gunman he shot was recovering.</i>

336
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,730
<i>Unfortunately for that guy,
Dr. Prisco paid him a visit.</i>

337
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,070
Let's take a look at this injury.

338
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,646
Oh, very good.

339
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,959
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

340
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,986
The Castaños.

341
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,059
The Castaños.

342
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,765
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

343
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,942
I say it was money.

344
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:31,178
More money than Judy Moncada can find.

345
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:33,908
Pablo.

346
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,980
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

347
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,197
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

348
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,630
This can't go unanswered.

349
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,132
Go.

350
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,779
Maria.

351
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,818
Carlos, you scared me.

352
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,536
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

353
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,475
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

354
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,639
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

355
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,478
No, Carlos.

356
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,181
Tata, my God, listen to me.

357
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,156
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

358
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,251
The public declarations,
the open displays.

359
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,830
They won't stop until he's dead.

360
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,765
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

361
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,033
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

362
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,702
That this is the last time...

363
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,741
The last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

364
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,075
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

365
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,515
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

366
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,077
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

367
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,917
And now? Hmm?

368
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,421
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

369
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,765
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

370
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:31,769
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

371
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,929
Even if we lived in exile with him.

372
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,475
But without him?

373
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,740
No.

374
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,408
Okay. Okay.

375
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,147
Let's do something.

376
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,282
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

377
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,794
I've had a good life.

378
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,967
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

379
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:23,278
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

380
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:26,256
She was so skinny.

381
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,818
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

382
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:34,161
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

383
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,526
I told her to wait and be patient.

384
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:43,131
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

385
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,439
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

386
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,137
Cheers to the family.

387
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,945
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

388
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,954
Cheers!

389
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,841
Wait!

390
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,607
Wait! Wait!

391
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:21,635
Ma! Papa! Papa!

392
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,901
- I'm here, my love.
- Mom!

393
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,251
That man...

394
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,827
has no decency.

395
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,839
To attack my family like this...

396
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,235
my daughter...

397
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,511
on the night of her wedding.

398
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,843
Only a madman would do that.

399
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,250
A crazed animal, dangerous.

400
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,492
I want him dead.

401
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,525
Not next year. Right now.

402
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,267
Kill all of them.

403
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,969
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

404
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,034
I want you to kill his secretaries...

405
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,978
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

406
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,883
I want to see them dead.

407
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:47,286
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

408
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,487
I want to see them dead!

409
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:55,500
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

410
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,561
That son of a bitch.

411
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:08,640
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

412
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,089
Gilberto?

413
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,526
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

414
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,928
That'll be all, Quica.

415
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,261
Thank you, boss.

416
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,370
Pablo?

417
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,870
I'm worried about Tata.

418
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,614
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

419
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,779
What you're doing will have consequences.

420
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,548
That's why they're here. Right?

421
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,927
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

422
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,895
- Cali is going to want payback for...
- I know...

423
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,361
who my enemies are, Carlos.

424
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,262
And I can fight them all.

425
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,601
I know that.

426
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,902
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

427
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,036
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

428
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,982
Let me ask you something.

429
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,393
- Why are you here?
- Pablo...

430
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,829
For Tata.

431
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,625
Right?

432
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,328
To make her happier.

433
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,576
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

434
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,440
Have you done that?

435
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:57,152
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that...

436
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:03,422
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

437
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,989
My wife and my children...

438
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,692
stay with me.

439
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,477
Hello.

440
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,182
Did you see this?

441
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,790
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

442
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,192
Gilberto Rodriguez's daughter's wedding?

443
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,025
I know of only one person in Colombia

444
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,293
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

445
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,062
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

446
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,864
He had to have had a damn good reason.

447
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,873
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellín to Cali.

448
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,965
Now's a bad time to deviate from Medellín.

449
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,478
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

450
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,072
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

451
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,412
But you're thinking about this
too logically.

452
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,518
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

453
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,320
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

454
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,086
Right. Escobar.

455
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,526
I'll see you at the party tonight.

456
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,038
We could all use a few hours break
from this shit.

457
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,105
I'll see you there.

458
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,716
Manuel.

459
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,184
Ma'am?

460
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,022
Take me to the church.

461
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,591
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

462
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,461
Besides, you work for me.

463
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:58,034
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

464
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:04,913
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

465
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:10,444
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

466
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:14,492
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

467
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,632
Welcome, Mr. President.

468
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,233
Welcome, Ma'am.

469
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,833
Yeah, Bogotá is beautiful. It's a lot more
like an American city than I thought.

470
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,432
I didn't know it'd be so cold.

471
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,069
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

472
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:42,644
It's shameful for the country
to stand by while a group of mercenaries

473
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:46,918
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

474
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,122
It makes all of us look bad.

475
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:54,325
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

476
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,767
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

477
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,430
which is his responsibility...

478
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,604
Colombia will never forgive him.

479
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,228
MERRY CHRISTMAS

480
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,186
Mr. President.

481
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,588
Lovely party, Ambassador.

482
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,886
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

483
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,257
Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

484
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,667
I can't wait to tell them
that he wants us to legalize drugs.

485
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,172
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

486
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,441
They're criminals.
Their activities cannot be condoned.

487
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:21,048
Even if one does approve of the results.

488
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,190
Mr. President, I'm not one to bullshit.

489
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,453
Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

490
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,086
Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

491
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,594
They're getting to Escobar.

492
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,529
That's all that matters at the present.

493
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,475
If I condemn them, I have to police them.

494
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:52,482
With politics and war
the trick is in the timing.

495
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:57,817
Watch how they evolve,
how their actions are received.

496
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:02,985
And up till then,
pretend they don't exist.

497
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,793
Well, we can if you can.

498
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,911
What are you up to in here?
Have a drink.

499
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,989
Thanks. Saved me a trip to the bar.

500
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,956
Call it inter-agency cooperation.

501
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:38,861
That's a joke. And it's funny.

502
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,196
Cheers. So where are you from, Bill?

503
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,498
Originally, Oregon.

504
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,498
You were in Afghanistan, right?

505
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,142
Well, I could tell you that
but then I'd have to...

506
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,173
Funny.

507
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,483
I know Bill Haler.
He was our guy in Afghanistan.

508
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:06,615
Oh, yeah. DEA Bill, we used to call him.

509
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,285
I liked him. Stayed in his lane.

510
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,165
So, as I'm sure you know,

511
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:19,636
I recently asked for a resource redirect
into some emerging players

512
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,138
in the trafficking world.

513
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,799
A group based in Cali. Ring a bell?

514
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,402
- We're not gonna talk about work, are we?
- My request was denied, Bill.

515
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:31,415
- We were just getting to know each other.
- So I spoke to DEA Bill.

516
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,416
- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

517
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:37,819
And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

518
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,987
Something about an ongoing operation.

519
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,394
He actually said...
That sounds like CIA Bill.

520
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,266
Look, I don't care what you do
with the commies and the paramilitaries.

521
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:57,869
But as soon as your ongoing operations
involve narcos, you're in my backyard.

522
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,134
Where were you?

523
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,898
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

524
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,374
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

525
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,706
How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

526
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,872
No one here is in danger.

527
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:40,248
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

528
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,945
Don't talk that way to my husband.

529
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:46,786
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is...

530
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,734
Take Tata and the kids!

531
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,998
You, cover my mother!

532
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,913
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

533
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,578
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

534
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,451
This way! Run!

535
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,991
Run! Run!

536
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:23,322
Run quickly!

537
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,763
Quickly!

538
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,495
- Pablo!
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

539
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,467
Carlos, let's go!

540
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,599
Run, Limón, run!

541
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,698
Let's go! Outside!

542
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,176
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

543
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,806
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

544
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,179
Give me the girl.

545
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:49,015
Get in, Tata, get in.

546
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,179
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

547
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,484
Move!

548
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,881
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

549
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,360
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

550
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,259
Carlos!

551
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,956
Come on, boss! Let's go.

552
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,554
- Pablo!
- Carlos!

553
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,536
No!

554
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,630
Come on! Come on!

555
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,903
Boss, come on!

556
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,035
Let's go, boss!

557
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,715
Come on!

558
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,377
- Let's go!
- Carlos!

559
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,990
No!

560
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,171
Los Pepes...

561
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,780
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

562
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,689
the Castaños, the government, the gringos.

563
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,557
Let the bastards come.

564
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:48,997
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

565
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,731
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

566
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,302
Yes, boss.

567
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,799
Go for food and you go for firewood.

568
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:08,342
Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

569
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,714
I promise you.

570
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:26,436
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

571
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:38,838
Santa...

572
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:47,715
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

573
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,528
Wherever you are in this world.

574
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:57,932
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

575
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:11,207
Go to Envigado for wood and food.

576
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,718
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

577
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,911
Got it.

578
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,783
This is all I could find, boss.

579
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,419
How do you open that shit?

580
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,225
I'll go look, boss.

581
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:45,974
This just came in.

582
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,115
Shit's getting real, Peña.

583
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:50,845
Mommy, I'm cold.

584
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,207
She's freezing.

585
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,223
Put this on.

586
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:43,066
You and the children
need to leave Colombia.

587
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:51,739
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

588
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:02,953
It won't be long.

589
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,252
Soon we'll be together again.

590
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,254
Forever.
