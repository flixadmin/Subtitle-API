1
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:50,078
They didn't come back

2
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,775
Arthur Shelby is still alive

3
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:06,059
Wire his village and tell them

4
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:42,602
You walk around this little place
dressed like big city hoodlums

5
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:56,621
None of my clothes fit anymore

6
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:59,967
I can't eat anything,
it's all shit

7
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:02,403
It's inedible, it's disgusting!

8
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:05,932
Spotted Dick? What is that?

9
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:08,112
I don't want to eat that. Why would I?

10
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,646
with all due respect...

11
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
You're right

12
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,875
Let's get this business finished

13
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,953
then we can all go home

14
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,420
then we can eat some decent food

15
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,222
We found another enemy.

16
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,324
This family has lots of enemies

17
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:38,145
She lives inside their territory

18
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:45,582
She says he's crazy in the head

19
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:48,668
To compensate her, they look
after her and her other kids

20
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,340
She thinks if she asks one of
the brothers to come to her house

21
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,324
They would come

22
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:00,652
So she says

23
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:04,365
People in this place hate forever

24
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:05,662
Like Sicilians
