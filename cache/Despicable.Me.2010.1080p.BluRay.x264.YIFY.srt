1
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,430
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

2
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,110
Justin!

3
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,230
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

4
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,540
Justin, you get back here right now!

5
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,000
No, stop!

6
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,500
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

7
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,300
Wait, wait.

8
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,420
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,050
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!

10
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,310
No, no, no! There he goes.

11
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,030
Justin!

12
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
I've got him! I've got him!

13
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,880
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

14
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,720
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

15
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,640
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.

16
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,890
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens

17
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,060
try to protect their beloved landmarks.

18
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,150
Law enforcement still has no leads,

19
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,610
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

20
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,240
is responsible for this heinous crime?

21
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,320
And where will he strike next?

22
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,670
I'm having a bad, bad day

23
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,790
It's about time that I get my way

24
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,460
Steamrolling whatever I see

25
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,800
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!

26
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,010
I'm having a bad, bad day

27
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,140
If you take it personal, that's okay

28
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,810
Watch, this is so fun to see

29
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,520
Despicable me

30
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,550
Morning, Gru!

31
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,050
How you doing?

32
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,130
Hello, Fred.

33
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,270
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

34
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,430
and I don't appreciate it.

35
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,150
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

36
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,980
Unless they're dead.

37
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,690
I'm joking!

38
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,700
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

39
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay. Yeah.

40
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,200
Steamrolling whatever I see

41
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,540
Despicable me

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm having a bad, bad day

43
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,130
If you take it personal, that's okay

44
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,140
Despicable me

45
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,690
You've got to be pulling on my leg!

46
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,570
Hello!

47
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,480
Cookies for sale.

48
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,820
Go away. I'm not home.

49
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,660
Yes, you are. I heard you.

50
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,580
No, you didn't. This

51
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,580
is a recording.

52
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,920
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

53
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,590
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.

54
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,180
Goodbye, recorded message.

55
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,100
Agnes, come on.

56
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,900
Kyle!

57
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,950
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.

58
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,150
Gru!

59
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,780
Dr Nefario.

60
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,530
I know how you must be feelíng.

61
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,080
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

62
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,580
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.

63
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,710
What? What happened?

64
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,210
It's all over the news!

65
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Some fella just stole a pyramid.

66
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,630
They're saying he makes
all other villains look

67
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,970
lame.

68
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,350
Assemble the minions!

69
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,840
Minions, assemble!

70
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,340
Okay. Okay.

71
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,520
Hey!

72
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,610
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

73
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,900
All right.

74
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,990
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?

75
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,080
Hello, everybody!

76
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,040
Yeah, all right!

77
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,450
Simmer down. Simmer down!

78
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,410
Thank you, okay.

79
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,420
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard

80
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,250
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

81
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,670
Apparently, it's a big deal.

82
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,180
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.

83
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,430
But am I upset? No, I am not!

84
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,350
A little,

85
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,350
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
and you guys are all right in my book.

87
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,690
No, no raises!

88
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,950
You're not going to get any raises.

89
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,450
What did we do?

90
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,540
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
Nice!

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,960
That's how I roll.

93
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,050
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?

94
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,260
But that's not all.

95
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,640
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

96
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,720
the small one from Las Vegas.

97
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,900
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.

98
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,770
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

99
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,530
but I have been working
on something very big!

100
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,830
Something that will blow this pyramid thing
out of the water!

101
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,790
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...

102
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,630
Thank you!

103
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,000
There he is.

104
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,540
He's styling.

105
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,510
Now, we have located a shrink ray

106
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,220
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

107
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,720
we will have the capability

108
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,770
to pull off the true crime of the century.

109
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,980
We are going to steal...

110
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,900
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.

111
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,330
Hey.

112
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,540
Dave, listen up, please.

113
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,590
Next, we are going to steal,

114
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,000
pause for effect,

115
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,970
the moon!

116
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,010
And once the moon is mine,

117
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,810
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

118
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,230
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!

119
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,450
That's what I'm talking about.

120
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,160
Yes?

121
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

122
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,250
and I really don't see how we can afford this.

123
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,130
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.

124
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,210
Hey, chillax.

125
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,920
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!

126
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,320
Edith, stop it!

127
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
What? I'm just walking.

128
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,420
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

129
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,800
Hello, girls!

130
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,720
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

131
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,640
Let me think.

132
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,220
No!

133
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,520
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

134
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,600
A mud pie.

135
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,270
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

136
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,650
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

137
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,320
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

138
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,490
Sort of.

139
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,830
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

140
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,920
Okay.

141
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,170
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.

142
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,420
Look at my face!

143
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,760
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

144
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Eighteen coco-nutties.

145
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,770
I think we can do a little better than that,
don't you?

146
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
Yeah.

147
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,110
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

148
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,690
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

149
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,490
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

150
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,780
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

151
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,030
Hi, guys.

152
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,210
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

153
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,840
I iust wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

154
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,300
That was you, wasn't it?

155
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,180
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?

156
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,060
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

157
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,890
that's very, very big, very important.

158
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,060
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

159
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,770
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.

160
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,220
Gru to see Mr Perkins.

161
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,720
Yes, please have a seat.

162
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,700
That's one small step for man,

163
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,320
one giant leap for mankind.

164
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,200
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

165
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

166
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,960
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.

167
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,760
Hey.

168
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,350
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

169
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,490
It's a mathematical term,

170
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,070
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

171
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,080
Vector! That's me,

172
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,420
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

173
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,170
Oh, yeah!

174
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,920
Check out my new weapon.

175
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,260
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

176
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,100
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

177
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,350
Do you want a demonstration?

178
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,560
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

179
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,110
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.

180
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,320
So, all I need

181
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,450
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

182
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,490
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

183
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,240
Well, very nice presentation.

184
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,620
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

185
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,790
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.

186
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,840
You don't have it?

187
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,590
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

188
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,180
Apparently.

189
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,600
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?

190
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,270
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

191
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,940
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.

192
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,990
If we don't start getting our money back...

193
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,530
Get the picture?

194
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,540
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,

195
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,660
younger than you, hungrier than you,

196
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,790
younger than you.

197
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,170
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

198
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,840
He just stole a pyramid!

199
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,470
I've got it. I've got it.

200
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,470
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...

201
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

202
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,610
Suckers!

203
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,990
Suckers!

204
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,210
We got it!

205
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,380
What?

206
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,260
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

207
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,010
No, no, no!

208
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,720
You!

209
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!

210
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,360
So long, Gru!

211
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,360
Quick! We can't let him get away!

212
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,870
Up ahead! Up ahead!

213
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,710
Fire! Fire, now!

214
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,380
You missed me!

215
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,510
Come to papa!

216
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,070
Take that.

217
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,740
How adorable.

218
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,530
Got you in our sights!

219
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,580
Like taking candy from a...

220
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,740
What?

221
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,750
Hey, Gru!

222
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,960
Try this on for size!

223
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,130
That's weird. What is going...

224
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,100
This is claustrophobic!

225
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,890
No, no, no!

226
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,150
Too small! This is too small for me!

227
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,280
I hate that guy!

228
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,130
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

229
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,250
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

230
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,590
and lay eggs in our brains.

231
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,590
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.

232
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,970
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

233
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,970
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice

234
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,980
and have a pet unicorn.

235
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,600
Amen.

236
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,440
- Amen.
- Amen.

237
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,610
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them

238
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,410
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them

239
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,120
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one

240
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,580
If they were really real

241
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,790
And they are

242
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,420
So, I bought one so I could pet it

243
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,710
Now it loves me
Now I love it

244
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,880
Don't you... What the...

245
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,570
Good luck, little girls!

246
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,960
Whoa! Cool.

247
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,090
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

248
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,090
- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!

249
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,470
We're selling cookies
so, you know, we can have a better future.

250
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,390
- Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
- Yeah.

251
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,660
Light bulb.

252
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,080
Dr Nefario!

253
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

254
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,460
- What?
- Cookie robots!

255
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,970
- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.

256
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,390
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

257
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,690
Dr Gru.

258
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,110
And I see you have made a list

259
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,940
of some of your personal achievements.

260
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,820
Thank you for that. I love reading.

261
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,080
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

262
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,290
and a knighthood.

263
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,170
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

264
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,510
Kevin?

265
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,340
You had your own cooking show

266
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,350
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

267
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,140
It's not that impressive.

268
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,600
Idiot!

269
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,440
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

270
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
What in the name of... What?

271
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,160
Well, here's the dealio.

272
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,160
Things have been so lonely since my wife,

273
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,540
Debbie, passed on.

274
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,710
It's like my heart is a tooth,

275
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,260
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

276
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,840
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,390
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

278
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,310
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

279
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,740
You have a face como un burro.

280
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,740
Well, thank you!

281
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,960
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?

282
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,620
So, so excited!

283
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,920
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

284
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,680
I bet the mom is beautiful!

285
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,890
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

286
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,760
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.

287
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

288
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,440
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.

289
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,150
That's a Cheeto.

290
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,780
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

291
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,620
Who's Debbie?

292
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,120
Your wife.

293
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,080
Hi, girls!

294
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,920
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.

295
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,340
He's going to adopt you.

296
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,970
And he's a dentist!

297
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,640
Yeah!

298
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,780
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

299
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,150
And that's Agnes.

300
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,200
I got your leg, I got your leg!

301
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,370
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

302
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,790
- Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
- Higher!

303
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,160
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

304
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,630
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

305
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,670
Some nonstick spray?

306
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,840
Crowbar?

307
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,300
Okay, girls, let's go.

308
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,580
Oh, yeah!

309
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,960
Pretty impressive!

310
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,210
What are you looking at?

311
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,540
Boo-ya!

312
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,760
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

313
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,420
Take that!

314
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,340
You done been shrunk!

315
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,390
Yello?

316
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
I got the shrink ray, all right.

317
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,940
No, I'm not playing with it.

318
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,520
Gru?

319
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,150
Don't make me laugh! No.

320
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,190
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

321
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,320
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,

322
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,950
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

323
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,240
Okay, bye.

324
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,330
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

325
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,590
Curse you, tiny toilet!

326
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,340
Okay, here we are.

327
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,970
Home sweet home.

328
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,350
So, this is, like, your house?

329
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,440
Wait a sec...

330
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,270
You're the guy
who pretended he was a recorded message!

331
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
No, that was someone else.

332
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,210
Can I hold your hand?

333
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,040
No.

334
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,180
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

335
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,400
No, hey!

336
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,660
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.

337
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,370
Girls, this is Kyle, my

338
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,490
dog.

339
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,410
Fluffy doggy!

340
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,000
What kind of dog is that?

341
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,720
He is a... I don't know.

342
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,800
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

343
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,970
'Cause it's not.

344
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,390
No! No! Stay away from there!

345
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,020
It's fragile.

346
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,070
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.

347
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,940
Hey! It's dark in here.

348
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,160
It poked a hole in my juice box.

349
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,370
As you can see,

350
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,960
I have provided everything
a child might need.

351
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,920
All right.

352
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,420
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

353
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,680
Somebody broke that.

354
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,810
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

355
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,720
Rule number one.

356
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,390
You will not touch anything.

357
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,310
What about the floor?

358
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,770
Yes, you may touch the floor.

359
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,230
What about the air?

360
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,400
Yes, you may touch the air!

361
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,530
What about this?

362
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,660
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

363
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,540
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.

364
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,500
Rule number three.

365
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,040
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle

366
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,750
or sneeze or burp or fart!

367
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,760
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?

368
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,090
Does this count as annoying?

369
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,810
Very!

370
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,690
I will see you in six hours.

371
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,690
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

372
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,700
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

373
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,270
Question. What are these?

374
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,230
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

375
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,780
Look at this. Watch me!

376
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,330
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.

377
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,500
Why are you so old?

378
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,670
Okay. I'm on it.

379
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,840
Hello?

380
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,770
TV!

381
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,830
What is that?

382
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,460
- Look at that!
- That is cool!

383
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,590
Come on!

384
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't think he's a dentist.

385
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,070
We've been working on this for a while.

386
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,900
It's a anti-gravity serum.

387
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,040
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

388
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,160
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far

389
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,250
no. No, they don't.

390
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,880
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

391
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,590
No, no.

392
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,510
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

393
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,850
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

394
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,560
under what circumstances
would we use this?

395
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,100
But, anyway.

396
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,610
What I really wanted to show you was this.

397
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,490
Now those are cookie robots!

398
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,870
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

399
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,620
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

400
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,380
We got bored. What is this place?

401
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,210
Can I drink this?

402
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,750
Do you want to explode?

403
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,420
Gru!

404
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,470
Get back in the kitchen!

405
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,680
- Will you play with us?
- No.

406
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,310
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

407
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,970
Doing what?

408
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,980
Okay, okay, you got me.

409
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,810
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

410
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,820
In real life, I am a spy.

411
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,490
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

412
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,660
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

413
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,660
Hey!

414
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,950
My unicorn!

415
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,960
You have to fix it.

416
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,340
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

417
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,800
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?

418
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,060
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

419
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,810
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

420
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,230
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

421
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,610
Tim! Mark! Phil!

422
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,530
This is very important.

423
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,120
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

424
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,040
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

425
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,340
Go, and hurry!

426
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,590
What are those?

427
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,840
They are my cousins.

428
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,220
Jerry! Stuart!

429
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,310
Watch them,
and keep them away from me, please.

430
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,950
- Wow!
- Wow!

431
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,180
It was your cousin's idea.

432
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,680
What?

433
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,560
Okay, bedtime.

434
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,320
Not you two!

435
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,570
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

436
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,330
Just so you know,

437
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,370
you're never gonna be my dad.

438
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,040
I think I can live with that.

439
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,540
Are these beds made out of bombs?

440
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,260
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

441
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,220
But try not to toss and turn.

442
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,430
Cool.

443
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,560
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.

444
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,730
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

445
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,400
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

446
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,860
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

447
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,820
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

448
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,030
And there's probably
something in your closet.

449
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,790
He's just kidding, Agnes.

450
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,940
It's beautiful.

451
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,800
Girls, let's go.

452
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,720
Time to deliver the cookies!

453
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,350
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.

454
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,350
Actually, we're going to have to skip
the dance class today.

455
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,980
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.

456
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,070
We have a big recital coming up.

457
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,400
- We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
- Yeah, Swan Lake!

458
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,240
That's fantastic. Wonderful.

459
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,410
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!

460
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,620
No.

461
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,540
No?

462
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,840
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

463
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,040
Really?

464
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,840
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.

465
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,300
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.

466
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,690
What are you doing?

467
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,520
Walking to dance class.

468
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,570
Ya? Okay, fine.

469
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,530
You iust keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

470
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,820
Okay.

471
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,780
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

472
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,290
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

473
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,330
And you had better be in this car!

474
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,040
Here we go! One! Two!

475
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,710
...three, four and five.

476
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,710
And lift, and stretch.

477
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,380
And one, and two...

478
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,590
- Here you go.
- What is it?

479
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,220
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

480
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,970
Of course, of course.

481
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,140
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.

482
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,100
Pinkie promise?

483
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,530
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

484
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,420
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.

485
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,250
But he's a V.

486
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,300
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

487
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,300
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

488
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:01,300
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

489
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,600
I was just thinking

490
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,440
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr Vector's first.

491
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,150
That is all.

492
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,950
Almost over. It's almost over.

493
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,290
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

494
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,790
Do you have my cookies for me?

495
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,470
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes,

496
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,260
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

497
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,930
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

498
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,100
Not likely.

499
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,350
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

500
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,980
That'll be $52.

501
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,860
Right.

502
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,160
Seven, eight, nine...

503
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,620
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

504
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,910
Seven, eight, nine...

505
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,790
Why are you wearing pyjamas?

506
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,170
These aren't pyiamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

507
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,190
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

508
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,320
What sort of stuff?

509
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,820
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

510
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,320
Like sleeping?

511
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,280
They are not pyjamas!

512
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,340
Here you go, 52 big ones.

513
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,900
Bye!

514
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,200
Come on!

515
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,100
What the...

516
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,610
Quiet down, fish!

517
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,740
Down, boy!

518
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,140
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!

519
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,150
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

520
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,950
Life is full of disappointments

521
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,780
for some people.

522
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,040
Don't do that!

523
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,130
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?

524
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,630
No.

525
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,210
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

526
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,340
Don't care.

527
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,550
- Please?
- Please?

528
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,260
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

529
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,390
- Pretty please?
- Please?

530
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,480
- Come on!
- Come on!

531
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,360
Light bulb.

532
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,910
Come on!

533
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,950
Goodbye, have fun.

534
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,920
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

535
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,420
What?

536
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,310
Oh, my gosh!

537
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,810
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

538
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,860
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

539
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,400
You've gotta let us play for it!

540
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,190
No, no, no.

541
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,570
Come on!

542
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,660
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

543
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,790
Well, it is not for sale.

544
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,830
But all you gotta do to win it
is knock down that little spaceship there.

545
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,840
It's easy!

546
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,510
Yay!

547
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,690
Again!

548
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,860
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

549
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,110
Just one more.

550
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,530
I accidentally closed my eyes.

551
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,880
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

552
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

553
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,060
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.

554
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,900
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

555
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,530
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

556
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,450
Do you know what that means, professor?

557
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,070
It means you don't get the unicorn!

558
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,080
Somebody's got a frowny face.

559
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,580
Boo! Better luck next time!

560
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,500
Okay, my turn.

561
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,440
Knocked over!

562
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,700
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

563
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,450
That was awesome!

564
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,160
You blew up the whole thing!

565
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,620
Let's go. Let's try another game!

566
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,090
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?

567
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,090
Okay, girls, go play.

568
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,940
I got the shrink ray!

569
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,780
Cotton candy!

570
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,740
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

571
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,950
We can't afford any distractions!

572
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,950
Get me Perkins.

573
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,130
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins,

574
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,180
but I figured that you would want to see this!

575
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,090
What?

576
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,110
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.

577
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,200
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.

578
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,570
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.

579
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,370
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.

580
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,080
What?

581
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,290
Sorry. Sorry!

582
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,500
Could you excuse me for just one second?

583
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,000
I told you not to touch my things.

584
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,090
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

585
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,880
Hey, can we order pizza?

586
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,890
Pizza? You just had lunch.

587
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,140
Not now, for dinner.

588
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,760
Dinner?

589
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,680
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

590
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,560
Can we get stuffed crust?

591
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,060
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

592
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,730
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

593
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,110
You're funny!

594
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,950
Just don't come out of that room again!

595
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,530
All right.

596
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,870
Sorry about that. Where were we?

597
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,540
You were sitting on the toilet.

598
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,170
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.

599
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,040
I know how much you like to laugh

600
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,340
inside. Now, I was saying...

601
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,890
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

602
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,350
Believe me, I am completely focused.

603
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,430
- Hello!
- What?

604
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,690
That guy is huge!

605
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,190
- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?

606
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,070
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

607
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,530
No, no, no!

608
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:26,660
Freeze ray!

609
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,370
Mr Gru?

610
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,410
Okay.

611
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,170
As I was saying...

612
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,090
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.

613
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,550
- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.

614
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,800
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.

615
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,010
You.

616
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,850
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

617
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,980
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket
out of macaroni!

618
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,990
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

619
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't understand.

620
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,630
Let's face reality, Gru.

621
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,470
You've been at this for far too long
with Far too little success.

622
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,890
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

623
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,350
Well, a younger villain.

624
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,940
But I...

625
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,110
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

626
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,840
Now, I know there have been
some rumours going around

627
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,220
that the bank is no longer funding us.

628
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,890
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.

629
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,980
They are true.

630
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,110
In terms of money,

631
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,440
we have no money.

632
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,110
So how will we get to the moon?

633
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,110
The answer is clear.

634
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,780
We won't.

635
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,120
We are doomed.

636
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:44,250
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

637
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,010
I know.

638
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:52,300
I have fired up my resume
as I suggest that all of you do, as well.

639
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,890
What is it?

640
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,100
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

641
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,130
Yes!

642
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,140
Yes, we will build our own rocket

643
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,310
using this and whatever else we can find!

644
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,390
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!

645
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,770
Who needs the bank?

646
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,610
Let's go. Let's go!

647
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,870
Mom! What are you doing here?

648
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,790
And here he is in the bathtub.

649
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,160
Look at his little buns.

650
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,000
Mom.

651
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,460
Not cool.

652
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,010
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

653
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,890
He looks like a girl!

654
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,140
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

655
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,540
You're funny!

656
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,010
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

657
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,660
Mr Perkins, your son is here.

658
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,580
Send him in.

659
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,410
Hey, Dad.

660
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,710
You wanted to see me?

661
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:12,750
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.

662
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,300
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!

663
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,720
Sit down!

664
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,760
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

665
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,140
Duh! Back at my place.

666
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,100
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.

667
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,440
I guess Gru must iust have one
that looks exactly like it!

668
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,280
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!

669
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:41,320
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

670
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,200
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

671
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,120
and you just blow it!

672
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,290
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

673
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,580
You iust wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.

674
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,670
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

675
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,800
There's a squid on my face!

676
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,640
Don't worry.

677
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,970
The moon is as good as ours.

678
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,310
Come on now, it's bedtime.

679
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,560
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

680
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,570
You did not!

681
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,740
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!

682
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,330
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

683
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,160
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

684
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,460
Will you read us a bedtime story?

685
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,710
No.

686
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,050
Pretty please!

687
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,970
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

688
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,130
It is still no, so go to sleep.

689
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,350
But we can't. We're all hyper!

690
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,930
And without a bedtime story,
we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.

691
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,100
All night long.

692
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,520
Fine.

693
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,570
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.

694
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,360
Sleepy Kittens?

695
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,200
- What are these?
- Puppets.

696
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,950
You use them when you tell the story.

697
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,580
Okay, let's get this over with.

698
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,340
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

699
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,840
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'

700
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,800
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

701
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,350
Keep reading!

702
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,520
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

703
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,190
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

704
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,610
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all#

705
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,230
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,

706
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,990
"'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."'

707
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,240
Now you brush the fur.

708
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,700
This is literature?

709
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:53,040
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

710
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,580
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed

711
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,090
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed! '

712
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,260
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,

713
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,260
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'

714
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,680
Now make them drink the milk.

715
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,900
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

716
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:23,320
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone,
rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.

717
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:35,500
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

718
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:41,340
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

719
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,130
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,

720
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,970
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'

721
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,310
The end. Okay, good night.

722
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,560
- Wait!
- What?

723
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,520
What about good night kisses?

724
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,240
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging
or kissing.

725
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,740
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.

726
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,410
I like him. He's nice.

727
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,830
But scary.

728
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,370
Like Santa!

729
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:42,110
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

730
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,030
About that,

731
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:50,780
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.

732
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:56,450
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

733
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,750
No, no, no!

734
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:01,880
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

735
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,880
I iust think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

736
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,550
I was thinking,
maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?

737
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,890
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

738
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:19,060
It's everything we've dreamed of.

739
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,060
Your chance to make history,

740
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:24,360
become the man who stole the moon!

741
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,230
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

742
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,650
They need to go.

743
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,410
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

744
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,740
I understand.

745
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,750
Good.

746
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,040
Butt.

747
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,470
Butt.

748
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,190
Butt.

749
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,820
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,

750
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,570
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.

751
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,820
Ready? Edith?

752
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:14,950
- Clink.
- Clink.

753
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,030
There we go. And now we drink.

754
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,830
And Agnes?

755
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,990
- Clink.
- Clink.

756
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,450
Very good!

757
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,540
Excuse me, girls.

758
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,040
Come on!

759
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,670
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.

760
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,260
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

761
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,510
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

762
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:39,510
I'm here for the girls. I received a call
that you wanted to return them.

763
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,350
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

764
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:50,980
I didn't like what you said.

765
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,440
But...

766
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,330
I will get the girls ready.

767
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,670
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!

768
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,800
Tell her you wanna keep us.

769
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,890
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

770
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,470
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.

771
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,660
I did it for your own good.

772
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,120
Come on, let's go get that moon.

773
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,040
Right.

774
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,740
What is this for?

775
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,700
The recital?

776
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,040
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

777
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,210
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!

778
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:39,990
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

779
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:45,070
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

780
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,620
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

781
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,750
six...

782
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,070
Oh, yeah!

783
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,570
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

784
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,070
Boo-ya!

785
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,920
My flight suit.

786
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,840
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

787
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,390
I've got it!

788
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:13,720
I've got the moon!

789
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,600
I've got the moon!

790
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,200
I can make it!

791
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,790
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

792
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,510
Come on, come on!

793
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,350
He's still not here.

794
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:59,850
Why would he come? He gave us up.

795
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,480
But he pinkie promised!

796
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,320
Girls, girls, places!

797
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,190
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

798
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,650
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

799
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,910
All right. But just a few more minutes.

800
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,080
He's not coming, guys.

801
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,540
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

802
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,420
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

803
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,420
Okay, okay. There's the library.

804
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,210
That's Third Street. The dance studio...

805
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,720
There! There! There it is!

806
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,590
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

807
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,550
Over?

808
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,010
Vector, open up!

809
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,260
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.

810
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,320
- Mr Gru!
- Lip it, Happy Meal.

811
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,900
Now, the girls.

812
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:58,360
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

813
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

814
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,240
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

815
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,450
Listen close, you little punk.

816
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,870
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

817
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,000
I'm really scared!

818
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,300
He is gonna kick your butt.

819
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,470
What? He punched my shark!

820
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,330
There he is!

821
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,500
Hang on, Gru.

822
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,130
Oh, no!

823
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,270
Vector has the girls. Go!

824
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,940
What happened to the ship? It's big again!

825
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,780
- Not as big as the moon is going to be!
- What?

826
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:05,950
The larger the mass of an obiect, the quicker
the effects of the shrink ray wear off!

827
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,950
I call it the Nefario Principle.

828
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,960
I just came up with it now, actually.

829
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,290
Oh, no!

830
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,670
Did you see that?

831
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,510
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

832
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,800
- Over here!
- Hey!

833
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,510
What are you girls doing back there?

834
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,640
The moon!

835
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,820
Watch out!

836
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,450
Get as close in as you can.

837
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:52,580
You got it.

838
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,140
- Mr Gru, up here!
- Mr Gru!

839
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,270
Okay, girls! Girls!

840
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,060
- You're going to have to iump.
- Jump?

841
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,060
Are you insane?

842
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,570
Don't worry, I will catch you.

843
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,900
You gave us back!

844
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:26,160
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

845
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,660
But you have to jump now.

846
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,330
It'll be okay.

847
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,330
Okay, girls.

848
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,920
Jump now!

849
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:48,220
Margo, I will catch you.

850
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,930
And I will never let you go again.

851
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,570
- Not so fast!
- No!

852
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,900
Let me go!

853
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:09,950
Margo!

854
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,960
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!

855
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,400
I got you.

856
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,670
No!

857
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,110
Oh, poop.

858
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,030
This time, good triumphs,

859
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,240
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

860
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,250
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,

861
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:39,120
who is this mysterious hero?

862
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,170
And what will he do next?

863
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:43,500
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

864
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:47,300
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

865
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:51,630
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

866
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:56,260
Tonight we are going to read a new book.

867
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,560
This one is called

868
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,310
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?

869
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,820
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!

870
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,320
Here, watch this.

871
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,320
That's the horn!

872
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,410
This is gonna be the best book ever!

873
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,290
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

874
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,460
Here we go.

875
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,550
"One big unicorn, strong and free

876
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:30,340
"thought he was happy as he could be.

877
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:35,140
"Then three little kittens came around

878
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:39,220
"and turned his whole life upside down."

879
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,060
Hey, that one looks like me!

880
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,270
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

881
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:47,110
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

882
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:53,030
"They made him laugh.

883
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,320
"They made him cry.

884
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,040
"He never should have said goodbye.

885
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:05,460
"And now he knows he could never part

886
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,130
"from those three little kittens

887
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:11,550
"that changed his heart.

888
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,720
"The end."

889
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,140
Okay, all right. Good night.

890
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,080
I love you.

891
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,330
I love you, too.

892
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,510
No, no!

893
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,840
All right.

894
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:05,020
Didn't I get you already?

895
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,850
They're very good!

896
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,890
I'm so proud of you, Son.

897
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,890
You've turned out to be a great parent!

898
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,520
Just like me.

899
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,360
Maybe even better.

900
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,390
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

901
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,600
No, no, no!

902
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,820
Hey, Carl! Hey.

903
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,160
No, no, no.

904
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,460
Me, me, me.

905
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,830
John?

906
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,380
No, no. Me, me, me.

907
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,150
Oh, poop.

908
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,070
Oh, no!

909
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,370
Stop! Stop!

910
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,970
Hello, I am Gru.

911
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:37,060
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
