1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,590
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,854
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
- Previously on The Flash:
-What did you say your name was again?

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,747
- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,749
How's Barry doing?

12
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,877
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,922
- The kind I have to keep.
- I just have a little experience...

14
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,092
with liking someone
who doesn't see you the same way.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,344
- Dad, the thing is...
- You two are dating.

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,221
- So you're not mad?
- Oh, I'm mad.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,561
What does the fastest man alive do
on his day off?

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,729
Before the lightning...

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,607
If wasn't still at the lab,
I'd be at home chilling.

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,276
Now my days off are different.

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,986
Now they aren't so lonely.

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,113
The lightning didn't just give me speed...

23
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,907
It also gave me friends.

24
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,829
- This isn't remotely anatomically correct.
- That's not the point, Dr. Snow.

25
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,999
Then what is the point?

26
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,208
To have fun.

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,544
And to continue your ongoing training.

28
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,007
We're testing the speed of your mind
by pushing your ability to multitask.

29
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,598
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

30
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,696
One hundred
eighty-two seconds, gentlemen.

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,373
Heads up. I think we got something.

32
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,059
Two-eleven. Two-eleven.
We're being robbed.

33
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,280
Hey, cool it.

34
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,117
A hundred fifty-eight seconds to go.

35
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,997
Checkmate.

36
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,375
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

37
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,795
I guess we still have a few things left
to learn, don't we, Mr. Allen?

38
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,298
Armed robbery at Fourth and Kolins.

39
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,678
For the record, I crushed it
in Operation and Ping-Pong.

40
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,019
It's not as easy as it looks.

41
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,672
Where's the nearest hospital?

42
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,966
St. Andrews.
Seven blocks north, two east.

43
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,136
Call the ER,
tell them they have an incoming GSW.

44
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,689
I want this locked up
all the way to the end of the block.

45
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,817
Tow truck was stolen.

46
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,238
The armored car driver is in stable condition,
though no one's sure how he got there.

47
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,073
Did you check the security cameras?

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,577
Camera storage drive was stolen.
Guys are pros.

49
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,704
Everything's still here.

50
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,040
Including what I think they're after.
The Kahndaq Dynasty diamond.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,793
It was on its way to Central City Museum
for exhibition.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,588
Right. Iris was trying
to talk me into going.

53
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:19,634
I'm not much of a museum guy,
but she really wants to do something...

54
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,722
I'm just gonna walk away now.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,310
Sorry, captain,
I was at the hospital visiting a friend.

56
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,813
There's nothing missing. It looks
like someone interrupted the robbery.

57
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,733
- Guard says there was three of them.
- Actually, it was four.

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,779
I mean that's how many I would bring
if I were doing a robbery of this nature.

59
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,822
That's definitely a four-guy truck.

60
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,909
A driver, two more to cover the guards...

61
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,829
and somebody used liquid nitrogen
to open this door, so four bad guys.

62
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,373
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

63
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,337
For somebody so fast,
you're slow on the improvising.

64
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,215
Did you see anything
that can help us catch these guys?

65
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,258
Yeah.

66
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,469
One of them lost his mask.

67
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,845
I saw his face.

68
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,353
Look at these mug shots of Central City's
most wanted. See if you can find...

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,562
That's him.

70
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,481
Damn.

71
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,857
Leonard Snart.

72
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,276
"Leonard"?
That's almost as bad as "Bartholomew."

73
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,736
Snart ain't sexy either.

74
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,739
Snart's father was a cop. A bad cop.

75
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,617
Took his anger out on his kids,
till he went to prison.

76
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,037
Snart's dad is in prison too?
We should start a club.

77
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,914
He shows up, like, every six months.

78
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,625
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,836
Then he does a job, gets away.

80
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,046
That's before the Streak was around.

81
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,715
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

82
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,844
I referred to the Streak.
I've been thinking of a new name.

83
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,429
- What do you think about the Flash...?
- Coffee break.

84
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,100
Thought I'd bring Central City's
finest java over to Central City's finest.

85
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,269
Thanks, I'm off caffeine.

86
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,524
My dad's been mad ever since
I told him about me and Eddie.

87
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,943
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,447
Uh, that sounds like you're taking his side.
You know his "I'm not talking to you...

89
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,742
but I have a bag full of
judgmental looks I'll try on you later"?

90
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,328
I've been on the receiving end of those
a few times.

91
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,998
Speaking of communications,
or lack thereof...

92
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,750
after all these journalism classes,
I got an idea.

93
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,586
- Huh.
- I started a blog.

94
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,006
What's it about? Your brownie obsession?
You shouldn't broadcast that.

95
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,801
No. Something important. Something
Central City needs to know about:

96
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,761
The Streak.

97
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,889
He's out there, Barry.

98
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,725
Rumor has it he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

99
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,436
- Heh.
- I was hoping I could take a look at the file...

100
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,106
I'm not at liberty to discuss an ongoing
police investigation with you.

101
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,775
Since when, Mr. Blabbermouth?

102
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,696
Take it from someone who's been studying
the impossible since they were 11.

103
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,866
Blogging about this,
it's gonna bring the crazies to your door.

104
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,453
- My blog is anonymous.
- Anonymous or not, it's not safe.

105
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,706
You never know what kind of weirdoes
are out there on the Internet.

106
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,416
I can vouch for that.

107
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,128
The Internet is full of weirdoes,
and nerd rage.

108
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,172
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

109
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,427
Hi. Felicity Smoak.

110
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,012
Iris West.

111
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,182
Barry Allen.
But you both already knew that.

112
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,018
- Uh, Felicity is...
- The girl that you met in Starling City.

113
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,478
The computer-er, right?

114
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,481
You two worked on one of Barry's
unexplainable cases.

115
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,693
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

116
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,949
So the lightning came through here?

117
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,202
Yeah.

118
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,957
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

119
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,043
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

120
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,461
What the hell is it, man?

121
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,088
Maybe it was a drone.

122
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,466
Some top-secret army thing.

123
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,762
When I was a kid...

124
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,100
my grandfather used to take my sister
and me to this diner, The Motor Car.

125
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,395
Food was for crap, but the view was great.

126
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,398
Right across from the
Central City precinct.

127
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:06,861
I still go there. I listen to their radios,
I learn their response times.

128
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,780
There are 40 banks in Central City...

129
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,700
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

130
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,328
That's the advantage of hitting
a moving target.

131
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,455
Once the armored car called 911...

132
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,876
we had 182 seconds
before any cop could be on the scene.

133
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,839
No one could've gotten there fast enough
to stop us.

134
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,300
But something did.

135
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,220
And you lost your cool.

136
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,014
You know the rules.

137
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,142
We don't shoot guards or cops,
unless it's the only option.

138
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,601
We don't need the heat.

139
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,438
The heat?

140
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,109
What the hell do you think the blur is,
Snart?

141
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,570
You're right.

142
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,865
Screw this, screw you. I'm out.

143
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,787
Well, if you're out, you're out.

144
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,499
This blur...

145
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,501
IS a man.

146
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,922
We're gonna have to up our game.

147
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,886
Iris seems very nice.

148
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,389
And really pretty, like super pretty.

149
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,599
Congratulations.

150
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,185
Iris isn't my girlfriend.

151
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,353
She's just a friend...

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,938
who actually has a boyfriend.

153
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh. That's interesting.

154
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,277
I guess.

155
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,573
What are you really doing here?
I mean, it's good to see you...

156
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,868
- but do you and Oliver need something...?
- No.

157
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,245
No, I came because I wanted to see you.

158
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,165
I... Heh. I heard you're out of the coma.

159
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,709
Didn't call. Didn't write.

160
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,713
Didn't race over...

161
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,886
Oliver told you?

162
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,808
Honestly, I heard you two talking on
that rooftop in Starling City that night.

163
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,562
I wanna see it.

164
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,398
And by "it" I mean your speed.

165
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,402
In case you thought I was talking
about something else, which I was not.

166
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,740
- Uh, okay, you see that building?
- Uh-huh.

167
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,910
Keep your eyes on it.

168
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,083
Whoo-hoo!

169
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,754
You took a picture of me?

170
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,133
- From the top of that building?
- Yeah. Don't Instagram that.

171
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,301
- Unbelievable.
- Heh.

172
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,428
Your shoes are smoking!

173
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:45,436
That's fine, it happens sometimes.
That's why I have a friction-proof suit.

174
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,438
Where did you get that?

175
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,774
I'll show you.

176
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,704
This is where my team monitors
the police bands for activity.

177
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,456
We can track anything that's happening.
Check this out:

178
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,792
- We've got our own satellite.
- I know.

179
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,461
- I've hacked into it from time to time.
- Rude.

180
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,840
It is, of course, so wonderful
to see you again, Felicity.

181
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,636
I'm just wondering how much of
our operation she needs to know about.

182
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

183
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,016
- Felicity works for the Arrow.
- Sweet.

184
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,517
And you, apparently, are not.

185
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,146
Now it's all making sense.
You know who the Arrow is.

186
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,480
Wait.

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,316
Do you know who the Arrow is?

188
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,484
Uh...

189
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,489
Let's just say that my team has a similar
setup but with more pointy objects.

190
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,824
Welcome, Miss Smoak.

191
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,328
Dr. Wells?

192
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,746
The Dr. Wells?

193
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,665
Please call me Harrison, Felicity.

194
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,000
You know who I am?

195
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,338
Ranked second in the National Informative
Technology competition at age 19.

196
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,966
Graduated MIT with master's degree
in cyber security and computer sciences.

197
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,843
I know who you are.

198
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,013
I keep an eye out for promising talent
in scientific fields.

199
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,349
That's what brought me Cisco and Caitlin.

200
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,558
And I foresaw...

201
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,686
great things from you.

202
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,190
Speaking of great things...

203
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,192
wanna see something cool?

204
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,031
- How fast can he run?
- He hasn't reached his top speed yet...

205
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,033
theoretically speaking.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,703
- So is he really okay?
- His heart rate is in normal range for him.

207
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,290
No, I mean,
the lightning bolt changed him.

208
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,209
Do any of you really know how much?

209
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,378
We know a fair amount.

210
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,756
If everything about him is sped up,
is he gonna age faster?

211
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,926
What would happen if he ran too fast?
Would he just be running...

212
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,054
and then poof, he's dust
in a red costume?

213
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,227
Everything we do here, at S.T.A.R. Labs,
is to protect Barry Allen.

214
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,147
Trust us, Felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

215
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,234
Wanna see how fast I can run backwards?

216
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,113
Don't worry. He heals quickly too.

217
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,579
Ah, I don't get it.
Why would Snart come here?

218
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,248
Snart's been deterred before...

219
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,252
but once he goes after something,
he doesn't stop until he gets it, ever.

220
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,300
Joe, I want you to know
that I'm really serious about Iris.

221
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,094
She's an amazing woman.
I can really see myself...

222
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,806
Did I ever tell you about that wild night
I had my last day of college?

223
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,225
I don't think so. No.

224
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,811
Not even after we kicked back a few beers
after work?

225
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,814
We've never done that.

226
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,860
Oh, right.
Those are things I do with my friends.

227
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,196
Since we've never done those things,
we ain't friends.

228
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,950
So there's absolutely no reason I need
to know about your dating life.

229
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:52,290
I just don't want my personal relationship
with your daughter to affect our...

230
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,626
- working relationship.
- It ain't about you, Eddie. It's about her.

231
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,963
So as long as we don't talk about
you and her...

232
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,465
we will be cool.

233
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,721
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

234
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,893
When a man loves a woman.

235
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,314
Let's get it on.

236
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,233
Quiet is good.

237
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,698
Hey, you two.

238
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,033
We're not a two.

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,827
- Oh. No. We're a one and one.
- Yeah.

240
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,664
Has Barry been showing you
some of the sights in Central City?

241
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,377
Yes. Um, I have seen
some pretty amazing things.

242
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,837
Really?

243
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,881
Well, if you got some time...

244
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,342
maybe we can show you
some of Central City's nightlife.

245
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,513
Oh. No. I get plenty
of nightlife in Starling City.

246
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,225
This is something that I don't think
that you're gonna wanna miss.

247
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,602
Trivia Night at Jitters.

248
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,356
Eddie's not really excited about it, I
admit, but could be our night, guys.

249
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,317
Our night to win $75 worth of cappuccinos.

250
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,194
Uh, yum.

251
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,031
I'm gonna go call work, check in,
make sure everything's okay.

252
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,534
- I'll be back in a second.
- Okay.

253
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,204
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

254
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,374
Trivia Night with you and Eddie,
forcing this double-date thing.

255
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,543
Because that girl is great.

256
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,631
And she happens to come from your
very rare species of adorable nerds.

257
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,260
- Why didn't you tell me more about her?
- There's nothing to tell.

258
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,886
She's just a friend.

259
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,223
Barry, girls don't just hop on trains
and travel hundreds of miles...

260
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,477
to see someone that they don't like.
See, this is why you need my help.

261
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,063
Bring her tonight. We'll have fun.

262
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,108
Yeah.

263
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,818
Fun.

264
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,909
You wanted state-of-the-art, Snart.
I bring you state-of-the-art, my good sir.

265
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,328
- What's this?
- It might not look like much...

266
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,747
but never judge a book by its cover,
you know?

267
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,750
Fires highly-concentrated
combustible liquid fuel...

268
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,003
that ignites on contact with the air.

269
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,921
I don't need to heat things up.

270
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,257
I need to slow them down.

271
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,095
That's the one then.
You're drawn right to it.

272
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,432
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident, heh...

273
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,852
with nothing but the skeleton
security crew to guard the tech inside.

274
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,107
Emits some sort of substance,
not sure what it is, like a white flame.

275
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,276
But it's not hot, it's cold.

276
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,779
Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech. What are they for?

277
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,449
Glare. You'll see.

278
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,618
Who else knows you took this?

279
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,453
Just us.

280
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,623
No, just me.

281
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,167
Sorry, pal.

282
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,512
Party people,
who's ready to get their trivia on?

283
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,724
Everybody, welcome.
We got some new challengers.

284
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,977
Please welcome E = MC Hammer.

285
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,318
I did it because E = MC squared is
Einstein's formula for kinetic energy, right?

286
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,445
And, you know, "Can't touch this."

287
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,364
That's great, Barry.

288
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,449
So where is Felicity?

289
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,825
I'm not sure.

290
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,536
I told her it started at...

291
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,209
Feel free to buy yourself that dress.

292
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,340
- Heh. Totally overdressed for Trivia Night.
- No, you look amazing.

293
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,591
Yeah, you do.

294
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,553
"E = MC Hammer."

295
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,056
- It's funny. Ha, ha.
- See?

296
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,854
It wasn't until 1852
when the transcontinental railroad...

297
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,649
laid their tracks
through this thriving cattle town...

298
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,776
that we became officially incorporated.

299
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,405
That same year the worst flood this area
has ever seen hit.

300
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,534
But from that disaster rose Central City's
greatest hero:

301
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,829
Cattle rancher Bobby "Bovine" McFeely.

302
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,000
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

303
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,795
Hey, kid. Gum?

304
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,807
And now for the exhibit
I'm sure you've all come here to see...

305
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,936
the historic Kahndaq Dynasty diamond.

306
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,940
Be careful. Get too close and
you'll set off the proximity alarms.

307
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,318
Wouldn't want to do that.

308
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,165
- Three is Pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

309
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,917
- Three is Erdel, and four is Pasteur.
- Right.

310
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,502
Five?

311
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,879
- Descartes.
- Descartes.

312
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,286
Are they even speaking English?

313
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,551
And the points go to E = MC Hammer.

314
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,198
- Yeah. All right. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

315
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,513
I knew you two would make a good team.

316
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,934
- So, Felicity, what do you do?
- I work in computer sciences...

317
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
- at Queen Consolidated.
- Really?

318
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,148
Do you have a boyfriend in Starling City?

319
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,151
Um, no. No, there is no one.

320
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,987
I'll get us more drinks.

321
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,033
And I had too many of those first ones,
so I will be right back.

322
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,876
- What?
- Dude.

323
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,795
"Dude"? What...?

324
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,840
Are you still gonna tell me
she's not into you? Look at that dress?

325
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,927
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question, she froze.

326
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,471
Yeah, you're particularly
sly with that one.

327
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,599
Felicity is smart, nice and pretty.

328
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,645
And most importantly she is the first girl
that I have seen you with...

329
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,107
that understands and appreciates you
for the amazing person...

330
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,526
that I am always
telling you that you are.

331
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,112
She's perfect for you.

332
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,197
So, what are you waiting for, Barry?

333
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,869
How long has it been missing?

334
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,205
I don't know.

335
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,334
I'm gonna ask you again, Cisco.

336
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,461
And when I do...

337
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,715
I expect a more specific answer
than "I don't know."

338
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,136
Now, how long has this weapon been gone?

339
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,847
A day.

340
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,517
Maybe two. One janitor didn't show up
for work this morning.

341
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,770
He was probably the one who took it.
I didn't think that...

342
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,566
You didn't think.

343
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,445
Because if you had,
you would've discussed with me first...

344
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,240
your desire to build something that
could hurt anyone, and in particular...

345
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,159
Barry Allen.

346
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,869
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,204
If you just let me explain...

348
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,709
You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco,
they do not belong in S.T.A.R. Labs.

349
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,670
Now, you're gonna figure out a way
to locate this gun...

350
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,299
and you're gonna do it right now.

351
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,098
This thing you built...

352
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,516
what can it do?

353
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,480
Bad stuff.

354
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,816
You said to call
if there was anything suspicious.

355
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,987
This guy went through the tour twice.
Nobody does that.

356
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,331
This is Detective West, I have a visual
on Leonard Snart at the museum.

357
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,374
Requesting immediate backup.

358
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,965
I'm sorry. I thought I knew it.
I got excited, and I just hit it.

359
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,718
Maybe they'll get it wrong too.

360
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,846
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that the team
named Pride and Padawans...

361
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,098
doesn't know the
name of Han Solo's ship.

362
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,934
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

363
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,606
Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

364
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,323
Someone spotted Snart. I gotta go.

365
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,411
- I'll cover for you.
- What will you say?

366
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,498
I tell people Oliver's at a night club
or nursing a hangover.

367
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,501
- None of which will work for me.
- Bad stomach ache. Diarrhea.

368
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,087
- I'm not comfortable with that excuse.
- Just go.

369
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,964
Stay safe.

370
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,842
And I'm talking to air now, which is odd.

371
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,844
I'm still doing it.

372
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,695
Snart!

373
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,719
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

374
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,437
- You okay?
- Aah!

375
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,397
It burns.

376
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,738
Time for a test run.

377
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,075
Let's see how fast you are.

378
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,848
No!

379
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,694
No.

380
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,249
- It's still numb.
- It's like third-degree frostbite.

381
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,794
- I thought he had hyper-healing.
- It's been slowed.

382
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,630
If your cells weren't regenerating
at the rate they are...

383
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,799
your blood vessels would've
frozen solid.

384
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,511
The nerve damage would've been
permanent. You're lucky to be alive.

385
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,179
Snart wasn't another metahuman.

386
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,517
He has some kind of gun. It froze things.
It slowed me down.

387
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,353
Enough that I wasn't able to save someone.

388
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,439
According to his records,
Snart didn't even finish high school.

389
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,859
So how did he build
a handheld, high-tech snow machine?

390
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,278
S.T.A.R. Labs built the cold gun.

391
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,782
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

392
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,368
I built the gun.

393
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,455
You did?

394
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:03,293
- Why?
- Because speed and cold are opposites.

395
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,214
Temperature is measured by how quickly
the atoms of something are oscillating.

396
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:11,719
Faster they are, the hotter it is. When things
are cold, they're slower on the atomic level.

397
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:16,098
- When there's no movement, it's called...
- Absolute zero.

398
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,349
Yeah.

399
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,021
I designed a compact cryo-engine
to achieve absolute zero.

400
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,190
I built it to stop you.

401
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,236
I didn't know who you were then, Barry.

402
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,365
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho, like Martin or Nimbus?

403
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,826
But I didn't, did I?

404
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:40,914
We built the entire structure you're
standing in to do good, and it blew up.

405
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,377
You can understand why Cisco
would wanna be prepared for the worst.

406
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,130
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand is...

407
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,466
why you didn't tell me what you did.

408
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,428
After all we've been through, I thought
you trusted me. I thought we were friends.

409
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,014
- We are, Barry.
- If you had just told me...

410
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,515
I could've been prepared.

411
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,560
But instead someone died tonight.

412
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,898
And I have to live with that.

413
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,651
No, Cisco, we all do.

414
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:20,245
Theater-goers remain shaken
after surviving tonight's bizarre attack...

415
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,290
The news, are you okay?

416
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,666
I'm fine.

417
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,920
How long is this gonna go on?

418
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,964
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

419
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,343
- Not now, Iris, please?
- Yes, now.

420
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,472
You did the same thing when I signed up
for the police academy without telling you.

421
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:42,684
You didn't speak to me for weeks,
not until I withdrew my application.

422
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,812
Well, I am not withdrawing this time, Dad.

423
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,231
I am dating Eddie,
whether you like it or not.

424
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,191
- Eddie is my partner.
- I know.

425
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:53,403
But you don't know. You're not a cop. You
don't know what having a partner means.

426
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,697
Wherever I go, he goes.

427
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,201
And where I go isn't always safe, Iris.

428
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,996
I need to be 100 percent focused.

429
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,500
Now there's a part of me
that isn't focused...

430
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,586
that doesn't see Eddie as my partner,
but as your boyfriend.

431
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,756
So if he gets hurt...

432
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,717
or worse, and I'm there...

433
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,262
now am I gonna look at you?

434
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,972
How are you gonna look at me?

435
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,433
Now, I'm not mad at you.

436
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,854
But that's why this is so hard for me.

437
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,857
Do you understand?

438
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,822
- We're going back tonight.
- Back where?

439
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,783
To the museum.
That diamond isn't gonna steal itself.

440
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,618
Super-gun freeze your brain, Snart?

441
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,329
The museum will be crawling with police
and the Streak.

442
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,290
This can stop the Streak. It hurt him.

443
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,501
And I know his real weakness, so we go.

444
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,006
- Unless you want out.
- We both want out. Alive.

445
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,634
So you thought I hadn't made a plan.

446
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,220
At least I taught you something.

447
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,849
So, what are you waiting for? Shoot me.

448
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,105
You better put a bullet in my brain
right now because if you don't...

449
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,608
ilf I ever see either
one of you again...

450
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,403
You don't get it, do you?
This blur is out there.

451
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,531
Central City ain't your playground anymore.

452
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,789
Sure it is.

453
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,297
Barry.

454
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,467
Barry.

455
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,263
What are you doing?

456
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,307
You should get back to your hotel.

457
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,935
- Get some sleep.
- You should too.

458
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,104
Not go back to my hotel,
I meant get some sleep.

459
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,818
I can't.

460
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,696
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

461
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,576
I watched him die.

462
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,206
I have to go faster.

463
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,042
Barry, it's not your fault.

464
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,337
And it's not Cisco's either.

465
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,633
I know you're upset, but you have
to look at this from his point of view.

466
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,053
No, I get it. He didn't trust me.

467
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,597
Barry, when you met us...

468
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,810
me, Oliver and Dig,
we were this well-oiled archery machine...

469
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,272
but it didn't start out that way.
And unlike you guys...

470
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,775
we weren't tossed together overnight,
we came together one at a time.

471
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:41,947
It took much more than watching Oliver
do the salmon ladder to make me trust him.

472
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,753
I've seen firsthand what this life
can do to people.

473
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,591
It's a lonely path.

474
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,553
Don't make it any
lonelier than it has to be.

475
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,233
Freeze!

476
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,069
Wanna end up like that door?

477
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,329
Hi there.

478
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,250
I figured out a way to track Captain Cold.

479
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,169
You gotta stop naming these guys.

480
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,920
Barry, listen to him.

481
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,048
How?

482
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,884
The cold gun
is powered by an engine-control unit.

483
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,386
A microcomputer that regulates
air to fuel ratio...

484
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,556
So the sub-cooled fluid in the chambers
don't overflow and...

485
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:50,891
- Explode.
- Right.

486
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,644
This ECU was receiving updates wirelessly
from my tablet.

487
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,314
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network...

488
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,317
and send a false update,
we'll get a ping back and then...

489
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,486
We can locate Snart.

490
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,862
How long will it take?

491
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,574
Uh, first, I have to hack into the
city's network, so 30 minutes maybe?

492
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,242
I can do it in less than one.

493
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,912
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

494
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,290
Ah! That was not as badass as I pictured.

495
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,337
- All right, I'm in.
- Are you kidding?

496
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,173
All right, I'm sending the updates.

497
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,343
- We're connected.
- Network is triangulating the location.

498
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,305
We got him. He's heading west on Nelson
toward the train station.

499
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,184
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten what he came for.

500
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:40,107
When we put our minds to it, dude,
nothing can stop us.

501
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,777
Oh, you turned your earpiece off.
How are we gonna talk to each other?

502
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,988
I don't feel talking right now.

503
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,455
Suspect spotted at
Central City train station.

504
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,500
We got Snart.

505
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,336
- Wait here for backup.
- Wait for backup? No way.

506
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,130
That's an order.

507
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,551
You should go after Barry.

508
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,137
- You heard him, Felicity.
- He wants to do this alone.

509
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,514
Of course he said that. He's hurt.

510
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,558
You're his team and his friends.

511
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,687
If I had a nickel for every time the Arrow
told me to back off, I'd be as rich as Oliver.

512
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,649
Who I mention because he's
the richest person I know, or used to be.

513
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,860
The point is...

514
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,239
you have your partner's back.
No matter what.

515
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,536
I have something that might help.

516
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,799
I'm your partner, not your assistant.

517
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,027
There's nowhere to run.

518
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,446
I didn't see you before.

519
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,781
Your mom know you're out
past your bedtime?

520
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,453
If you wanted to get away, you should've
taken something faster than a train.

521
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,872
That's if I wanted to get away.

522
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,707
I've seen your weakness.

523
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,710
At the armored car, then at the theater.

524
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,131
So while you're busy saving everybody,
I'll be saving myself.

525
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,481
Good luck with that.

526
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,857
Pretty fast, kid.

527
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,027
But not fast enough.

528
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,867
Thank you.

529
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,329
- For what?
- You forced me to up my game.

530
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,958
Not only with this gun,
but with how I think about a job.

531
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,543
It's been educational.

532
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,752
Drop it.

533
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,801
This is a prototype cold gun,
four times the size, four times the power.

534
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,930
I was wondering who you were talking to.

535
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,435
Hey, unless you wanna taste
your own medicine, I'd back the hell up.

536
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,979
Your hands are shaking.
You've never killed anyone.

537
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,190
There's a first time for everything,
Captain Cold.

538
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,402
I will shoot you.

539
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,284
You win, Kid.

540
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,829
I'll see you around.

541
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,960
Hey, leave the diamond.

542
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,172
Don't push your luck.

543
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,096
I couldn't shoot him if I wanted to.

544
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,557
This is actually the S.T.A.R. Labs
vacuum cleaner.

545
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,101
With a lot of LEDs.

546
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,896
Let's get you warm.

547
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,608
Thank you.

548
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,163
We've been trying to track Snart...

549
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,375
but he must've disconnected
the signal somehow.

550
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,211
We'll find him, Cisco.

551
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,129
Together.

552
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,510
You have a great team here, Barry.

553
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,470
Speaking of teams...

554
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,555
I should probably get back to mine.

555
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,518
It's nice meeting you, Miss Smoak.

556
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,062
Please extend a hello to the Arrow for us.

557
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,438
I will.

558
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,152
Bye, Felicity.

559
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,947
Bye, Barry.

560
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,421
Remarkable young woman.

561
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,548
She's special.

562
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,259
Yeah, she is.

563
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,724
Cisco...

564
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,062
don't you ever...

565
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:15,108
do anything like that again.
Do you understand me?

566
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,944
Yes, sir.

567
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,378
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

568
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,509
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in Evidence.

569
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,845
I am looking for you.

570
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,890
I came to apologize again.

571
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,644
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

572
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,563
Look, Dad...

573
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,733
I just want you to know
there is nothing that you could do...

574
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,152
that would ever change
the way I look at you.

575
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,114
And I'm sorry. I should've thought
how it would affect you if Eddie and I...

576
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,908
Listen.

577
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,328
Chasing down this
Snart character tonight...

578
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,580
he had the draw on me.

579
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,957
Eddie saved my life.

580
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,337
Maybe I underestimated him.

581
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,340
From now on, no more secrets.

582
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,847
No more secrets.

583
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,270
- Well, go see Eddie.
- Heh, okay.

584
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,106
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

585
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,379
- Did I just yelp?
- Ha, ha. Yeah.

586
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,840
- I yelped.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

587
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,177
- Don't tell me you're here to save me.
- This is still one of the safest ways to travel.

588
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,054
I thought that was airplanes.

589
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,271
Remember you told me you had
a little experience...

590
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,940
liking somebody who didn't see you
the same way?

591
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,861
That was Iris, right?

592
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,365
How did you know?

593
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,492
It's the little things.

594
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,245
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking.

595
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,832
The smile you fake to play the part.

596
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,377
Quiet dreams you keep to yourself.

597
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,506
Like you and Oliver.

598
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,510
Takes one to know one.

599
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm afraid it'll change everything.

600
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,271
It will.

601
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,482
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

602
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,990
What is wrong with us?
We are perfectly perfect for each other.

603
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,702
Yet we're sitting here
pining for people we can't have.

604
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,371
Guess what they say is true.

605
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,291
Opposites do attract.

606
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,631
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

607
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,216
Same. Well, as fast as I can run.

608
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,761
Which may take me a while,
but I will still come.

609
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,562
Bye, Felicity.

610
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,918
Bye, Barry.

611
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,253
Whoo-hoo!

612
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,429
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

613
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,641
I know it didn't go so well for you.

614
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,936
And I know I said we were finished,
but things have changed.

615
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:24,399
If I wanna keep working in Central City,
I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

616
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,943
I'm gonna need someone like you.

617
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,364
You're tolerant of extremes,
you have certain skills.

618
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,367
You just need some direction.

619
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,037
And I can give that to you.

620
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,290
You still like playing with fire?

621
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,376
You're gonna love this.

622
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,962
