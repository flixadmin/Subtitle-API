1
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:33,707
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,399
...on those accused.

3
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,176
On this...

4
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:43,511
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

5
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:46,050
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:48,583
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,287
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:56,355
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:00,295
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,698
Chief architect of this
intended revolution...

11
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,933
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:11,836
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,248
The decision of the
council will now be heard.

14
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,713
Guilty.

15
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:18,912
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

16
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,480
Guilty.

17
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,726
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

18
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:30,162
It has therefore now become your decision.

19
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:32,663
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,769
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:48,815
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

22
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,177
I swear it.

23
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:55,345
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,615
Both you...

25
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:57,983
...and then one day...

26
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,059
...your heirs!

27
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:33,018
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,362
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,657
Forgive me!

30
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:16,226
Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.

31
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:20,072
Their protection
will ensure your strength.

32
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:33,613
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:43,348
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:45,958
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,563
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,664
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,036
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:33,000
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,301
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,275
Stand aside, now.

41
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,468
Free!

42
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,006
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:10,041
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:14,337
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:17,951
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,245
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,618
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,951
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,093
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,456
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,531
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:37,033
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,035
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:40,571
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:45,078
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,770
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,438
Poor guy.

58
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,252
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,695
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,007
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,673
Hi.

62
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,446
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,449
Now, see, Jimmy, you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,783
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:05,956
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:09,922
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,758
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,299
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,733
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,668
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,298
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:26,105
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,044
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:33,209
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.

75
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:37,084
Some of those hotels are bilking those
poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:40,488
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,787
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:47,593
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:52,262
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,703
No, Superman?

81
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,072
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:00,711
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:05,318
- ...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,009
Darn.

85
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:10,856
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:14,858
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:17,997
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,433
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:23,832
Let me just turn on
the lights for you then.

90
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,502
Get the picture?

91
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,004
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,479
...because a good reporter isn't
supposed to let anything slip by her.

93
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,084
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,719
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:45,290
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:49,621
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,055
...dark hair.

98
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:55,167
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,929
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,468
...Superman.

101
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:02,272
Superman?

102
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:06,606
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,375
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,542
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,822
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:01,461
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,666
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,700
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,643
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,380
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:38,794
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,236
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,933
How do they choose to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,045
...the greatest genius in this world?

115
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:50,115
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:54,379
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,320
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,328
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,295
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:09,663
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:13,067
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,303
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:22,509
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:25,651
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,184
- Where?
- North.

126
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:29,184
Why?

127
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,653
To ski?

128
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:34,225
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:37,625
Some, like you, Otis, have more than one.

130
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:39,732
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,529
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:47,665
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:51,072
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,140
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,585
...what's it for?

136
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:06,556
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:09,388
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:14,560
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,464
I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?

140
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:21,266
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:22,840
Boy.

142
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:31,575
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:36,484
And when I have his
secret, I'll have Superman.

144
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,123
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:50,702
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:58,110
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:01,103
Too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:04,216
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:06,151
Hey.

150
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:11,251
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:14,518
Anyway, somebody's gotta
check up on those guys.

152
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:17,527
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:20,461
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:23,569
The whole world's forgotten about it.

155
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:27,966
Houston calling Artemis II.

156
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:31,608
Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.

157
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:34,338
Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.

158
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,448
- Yo.
- How are things going?

159
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:39,685
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,754
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:45,221
More rocks. Nice.

162
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:48,486
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:51,222
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:54,859
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,333
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,495
Surface conditions unchanged?

167
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:02,699
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,903
- ...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.

169
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:09,240
Right.

170
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,481
Look, Nate?

171
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,243
Nate, wake up, will you?

172
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,980
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,420
Artemis, come in.

174
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,686
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,261
Unidentified?

176
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,559
- What does it look like?
- Well...

177
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,430
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,555
You.

179
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:57,786
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,658
A man?

181
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:00,154
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:28,180
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,095
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,891
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,328
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,632
Houston!

187
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:45,763
Come on.

188
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:50,438
Come on, Houston!

189
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,745
Oh, no. No!

190
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,145
Somebody help me!

191
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:05,714
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?

192
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:09,328
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:11,191
Well, we really...

194
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,629
Artemis, come in, please.

195
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:19,666
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:26,843
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,949
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:35,554
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:41,955
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,959
...a yellow sun...

201
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,089
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:50,065
They come from there.

203
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:52,227
A place called Houston.

204
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,805
Then we will go there too...

205
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,908
...to rule.

206
00:24:57,377 --> 00:25:00,039
Finally, to rule.

207
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:12,252
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,525
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,560
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,830
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,537
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:30,337
I said, lights out.

213
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:36,609
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:40,743
I told you to...

215
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:58,397
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:33,171
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,998
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,370
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:42,878
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:48,415
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:51,751
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:55,657
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,830
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,499
Go out there and find it.

225
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:12,667
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:26,552
I think I found it.

227
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,596
What is it?

228
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,467
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:39,670
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:49,808
Come on.

231
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:54,245
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:57,051
Come on, hurry.

233
00:27:58,057 --> 00:28:00,423
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:04,427
- Yard line, touchdown!
- Oh, what a beautiful play.

235
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:07,327
But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...

236
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:13,963
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,734
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:19,671
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,177
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,361
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,232
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,306
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,203
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,604
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:54,770
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,676
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,551
Hot air rises.

248
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:03,150
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:05,586
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:29:05,758 --> 00:29:08,625
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:11,195
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:13,863
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:17,298
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,597
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:22,002
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:24,232
That's possible.

257
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:29,844
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,210
Due north.

259
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:34,076
Lex, north.

260
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,750
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:40,589
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,523
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:45,061
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,392
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:49,831
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:19,127
Excuse me.

267
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,865
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:27,801
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:30,807
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:34,504
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,079
Certainly, dear.

272
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,324
Mush! Mush!

273
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:50,519
I am mushing.

274
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,801
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:30:55,968 --> 00:31:00,064
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:30,731
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:32,598
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:36,333
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:39,410
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:44,380
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:47,886
Right.

282
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,521
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,561
Move out of the way.

284
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,429
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,331
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:06,403
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:09,934
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:15,171
Come on.

289
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:29,084
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:32,262
It's fantastic!

291
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:39,868
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,407
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,310
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,175
No, me.

295
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:54,886
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:32:57,289 --> 00:32:58,950
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,559
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:07,125
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,295
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:16,471
Get!

301
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:21,310
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,778
Why doesn't the guy put up some pictures?

303
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:26,474
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,923
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,520
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,630
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:08,824
The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...

308
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:11,189
- What the...?
- ...owning a certain conviction...

309
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:14,196
...that what has been done is right.

310
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,527
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,569
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,173
Develop such conviction in yourself.

313
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:23,669
Are you here?

314
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:27,869
- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.

315
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:32,381
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,542
Lies, monstrous deceptions.

317
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:40,391
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,424
Give me another crystal.

319
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:55,831
Education crystal 108. Earth culture.

320
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:00,636
A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-El.

321
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:03,407
Trees by Joyce Kilmer.

322
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:05,814
I think that I shall never see.

323
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:08,886
A poem as lovely as a tree.

324
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:12,313
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,925
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,789
Cute.

327
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,395
My son...

328
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:26,568
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:31,870
...the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.

330
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:34,774
- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...

331
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:38,246
...even on our peaceful planet...

332
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,781
...there have appeared
once in a great while...

333
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:44,218
...certain antisocial elements.

334
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:45,956
Deviants...

335
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,059
...what you call on Earth "criminals."

336
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:49,555
Criminals.

337
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:52,219
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:55,367
Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...

339
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:59,095
...and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...

340
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:02,172
- ...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?

341
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,674
There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.

342
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:08,541
Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.

343
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:10,373
There's hope.

344
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,710
Non, the destroyer.

345
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:17,185
Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.

346
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,924
Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...

347
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:24,119
...which could never be determined.

348
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:26,264
And the one force
that could unite them...

349
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:30,994
...the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:

350
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,432
General Zod.

351
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:35,472
- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...

352
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,974
...was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.

353
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,471
But after a long and terrible battle...

354
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,744
...peace and harmony
were once again restored.

355
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:47,442
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,987
We had, of course, no death penalty.

357
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,948
Sensible enough.

358
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:56,518
And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...

359
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,528
...to be imprisoned for all eternity.

360
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,467
I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.

361
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,401
On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.

362
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:15,309
On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...

363
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:17,978
...that you have.

364
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,846
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:25,923
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:30,255
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:35,065
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:38,065
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:42,674
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:45,636
Too true to be good.

371
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,244
Right?

372
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,518
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,787
I think.

374
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,424
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:06,462
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:07,927
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,935
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:16,199
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:19,602
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:22,713
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:25,748
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:28,284
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,313
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,320
- No, I've got it. No, I...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:35,585
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,422
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:38,756
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:41,798
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,903
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,599
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,766
Get down! Get down!

392
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:56,937
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:02,809
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,681
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:09,191
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:13,195
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:16,334
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:19,938
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,596
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,538
Him again, huh?

401
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:27,044
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:29,510
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,878
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:34,144
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,718
Hot dog.

406
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:37,446
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:39,682
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,990
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:51,159
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:57,237
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,670
Oh, my God!

412
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:05,340
Help!

413
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,280
Help!

414
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:10,717
Somebody help!

415
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:13,989
Do something!

416
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,530
Good.

417
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,163
Hey, Superman!

418
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:25,699
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:30,166
We got a great shot.

420
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:33,334
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:38,472
Incredible.

422
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:48,322
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:51,725
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:55,856
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,229
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:40:58,403 --> 00:41:01,839
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:04,168
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:07,303
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:36,070
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:40,438
A very strange surface.

431
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,536
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,701
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:17,371
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:20,177
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:22,445
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:25,250
Well, anyway...

437
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:28,655
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:31,489
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:34,063
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,553
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:42:36,702 --> 00:42:38,465
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:41,596
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:46,267
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:49,710
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,940
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:54,847
...I'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,615
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,417
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,720
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of girls who'd...

450
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,026
Well, a few girls anyway.

451
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:08,189
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:13,828
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:19,708
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:22,711
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:26,942
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,420
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:31,188
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:37,321
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,494
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:44,295
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:47,131
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:49,331
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:43:49,508 --> 00:43:51,976
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:53,736
There, that's better.

465
00:43:53,912 --> 00:43:57,370
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:01,349
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,114
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:06,553
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:10,161
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,897
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:18,098
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,137
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:23,866
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,407
Him who?

475
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:29,104
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:32,478
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:36,314
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:40,016
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:43,525
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:46,095
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:48,528
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,703
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:56,739
...all around the world, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:58,307
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:02,311
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:05,939
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:09,849
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,717
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:14,119
...and you were gone.

490
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:15,486
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,996
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:22,061
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:25,726
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:45:25,904 --> 00:45:27,701
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:30,137
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:45:30,308 --> 00:45:32,538
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:36,647
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:40,508
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:42,744
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:46,118
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,350
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:02,433
It is you.

503
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,706
I guess I've known
this for the longest time.

504
00:46:14,586 --> 00:46:16,383
You realize, of course...

505
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:19,547
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,688
With a blank?

507
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:28,259
Gotcha.

508
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:55,287
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:05,664
Did you see that?

510
00:47:06,972 --> 00:47:09,167
Did you see what I did?

511
00:47:09,341 --> 00:47:11,901
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,041
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:59,582
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:02,818
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:06,628
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:09,096
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:11,696
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:15,030
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,833
Good.

520
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:19,169
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:39,323
I don't know.

522
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:43,462
From the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

523
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:56,679
Hey, you hippies, get
your butts off the road!

524
00:48:57,048 --> 00:49:00,142
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:02,747
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:05,252
Make way.

527
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:07,887
Did I hear right?

528
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:09,856
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:49:10,395 --> 00:49:12,386
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:49:17,435 --> 00:49:20,199
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:22,397
What is this symbol?

532
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:24,371
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,874
Follow the leader?

534
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:30,412
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,777
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:44,356
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:53,436
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:59,375
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:03,439
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:50:10,822 --> 00:50:13,484
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:20,890
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:23,996
No. No, I really...

543
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:26,330
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:28,665
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

545
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:34,812
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:40,151
But he is you.

547
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:44,252
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:48,124
Everything's clear.

549
00:50:52,797 --> 00:50:56,563
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:50:56,735 --> 00:51:01,138
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:02,739
Has increased by three.

552
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,933
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,807
As I look west into East
Houston this morning...

554
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,177
- ...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?

555
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,318
Get that guy. Follow the guy.

556
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:16,113
Who's the big guy?

557
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:18,821
Okay, yeah, we've got a...

558
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:20,852
- You got that?
- No.

559
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:26,960
- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.

560
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,066
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:33,102
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:35,466
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,007
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:51:41,312 --> 00:51:43,371
You may continue.

565
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:47,211
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:50,278
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:53,891
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:51:54,058 --> 00:51:56,788
Throw down your arms and surrender!

569
00:51:57,362 --> 00:51:59,830
This is an order.

570
00:52:01,866 --> 00:52:05,427
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:30,818
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:33,259
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,894
Yes? Yes.

574
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:40,800
The Newsbeat control room has informed me
that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...

575
00:52:40,972 --> 00:52:44,499
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:52:44,676 --> 00:52:46,974
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:48,578
Where's Superman?

578
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:51,806
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:05,423
Fire again.

580
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:09,199
Fire again.

581
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:15,895
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:19,370
- Banking now.
- What bravery.

583
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:23,670
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,280
Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.

585
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:32,616
We're out of control.

586
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:38,025
We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!

587
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:39,458
We're coming down.

588
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,370
I win.

589
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:50,866
I always win.

590
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,343
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,800
Come forward.

592
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:19,035
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:54:19,304 --> 00:54:23,536
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:54:24,876 --> 00:54:28,903
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,648
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:36,776
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:39,483
In return for your obedience...

598
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:42,319
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:46,361
In other words, you
will be allowed to live.

600
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:51,858
So you are a general?

601
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:55,065
And who is your superior?

602
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,971
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:06,046
Or all of his cities will
end up like this one.

604
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:15,685
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,988
Imagine what they'll do
to the world if we resist.

606
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,233
The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-El.

607
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:30,135
You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.

608
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:37,071
And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.

609
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,519
My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.

610
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:44,518
This was one I'd...

611
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:47,891
I'd hoped you would not ask.

612
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:53,030
My attachment...

613
00:55:55,066 --> 00:56:00,368
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:03,003
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:56:03,174 --> 00:56:07,634
You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...

616
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,939
...at the expense of the rest.

617
00:56:10,148 --> 00:56:14,949
- The concepts are mutually exclusive.
- And...

618
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:20,952
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:25,329
Is this how you repay their gratitude?

620
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:29,296
By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...

621
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:32,095
...for the sake of your selfish pursuits?

622
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:35,739
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:56:35,907 --> 00:56:38,501
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:56:38,676 --> 00:56:41,236
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:56:41,412 --> 00:56:44,040
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:47,478
Yours is a higher happiness.

627
00:56:47,652 --> 00:56:52,021
The fulfillment of your mission,
an inspiration you must have felt.

628
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:55,558
You must have felt
that happiness within you.

629
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,988
My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.

630
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:02,696
No, I cannot...

631
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:07,235
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:09,901
So much stronger.

633
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:18,040
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:57:18,683 --> 00:57:22,642
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:27,120
If you will not be Kal-El...

636
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,426
...if you will live as one of them...

637
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,985
...love their kind as one of them...

638
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:34,758
...then it follows that you must...

639
00:57:35,466 --> 00:57:37,559
...become one of them.

640
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:11,899
This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.

641
00:58:12,403 --> 00:58:13,802
Once exposed to them...

642
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:17,498
...all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.

643
00:58:18,442 --> 00:58:19,932
Forever.

644
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:22,636
Once this is done, there's no going back.

645
00:58:24,115 --> 00:58:26,515
You will feel like an ordinary man.

646
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:30,612
And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.

647
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,688
Think, Kal-El.

648
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:37,788
I beg you.

649
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:40,490
Father...

650
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:42,960
...I love her.

651
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:02,508
Think, Kal-El.

652
01:00:59,337 --> 01:01:00,998
Come on. Come on.

653
01:01:11,882 --> 01:01:13,076
Look out!

654
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:06,201
You are the one they call president?

655
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:08,598
I am.

656
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:14,542
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
01:02:15,913 --> 01:02:17,608
Good.

658
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:20,643
Rise before Zod.

659
01:02:24,622 --> 01:02:27,591
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:43,330
You are not the president.

661
01:02:43,641 --> 01:02:48,408
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:50,376
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:53,580
I am the president.

664
01:02:54,518 --> 01:02:56,748
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:02:57,188 --> 01:02:58,917
It will.

666
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:01,649
Starting with your own.

667
01:03:05,362 --> 01:03:08,559
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:11,832
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:13,996
...and the jewelry.

670
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:29,351
What I do now...

671
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,717
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

672
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:36,883
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:40,459
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:42,622
I wish I knew.

675
01:03:46,971 --> 01:03:48,336
Oh, God.

676
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:50,363
Zod.

677
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,443
Hey.

678
01:03:54,612 --> 01:03:57,137
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:02,148
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,846
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:04:06,657 --> 01:04:10,184
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:13,854
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:04:14,031 --> 01:04:17,967
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:04:18,135 --> 01:04:19,864
Hurry up.

685
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:21,937
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:04:25,142 --> 01:04:27,474
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:33,581
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,483
Thank you.

689
01:04:39,723 --> 01:04:42,453
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,151
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,621
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,394
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,233
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:04:57,274 --> 01:05:00,266
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:05:00,444 --> 01:05:01,968
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:04,874
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:06,812
Coming right up.

698
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:10,676
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:13,790
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,153
No, thank you.

701
01:05:17,061 --> 01:05:19,359
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:22,688
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:29,571
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,199
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:35,868
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,581
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:05:39,783 --> 01:05:42,513
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:48,519
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:05:49,093 --> 01:05:52,859
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:05:54,098 --> 01:05:55,656
After you.

711
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,198
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:02,597
Clark!

713
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:06,241
You all right, fella?

714
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:09,174
He's gonna be fine, just give me that.

715
01:06:09,513 --> 01:06:13,040
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:18,082
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:21,713
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:06:21,892 --> 01:06:24,019
I know that, Lois.

719
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:26,424
I wish he were here.

720
01:06:32,102 --> 01:06:33,831
Clark.

721
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:38,436
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:49,614
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:52,549
Settle down!

724
01:06:53,123 --> 01:06:55,557
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:06:57,728 --> 01:06:59,593
Oh, God.

726
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,639
Clark? Clark?

727
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,604
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:14,471
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:16,441
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:07:18,282 --> 01:07:20,944
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:25,981
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:28,454
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:32,126
We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...

734
01:07:32,296 --> 01:07:35,197
...from the President
of the United States.

735
01:07:35,432 --> 01:07:37,764
This is your president.

736
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:42,870
On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the world...

737
01:07:43,373 --> 01:07:46,103
...with whom I have today consulted...

738
01:07:46,643 --> 01:07:49,407
...I hereby abdicate...

739
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:53,912
...all authority and
control over this planet...

740
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:55,975
...to General Zod.

741
01:07:56,787 --> 01:07:57,981
Zod.

742
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:01,682
Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...

743
01:08:02,493 --> 01:08:06,452
...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.

744
01:08:06,997 --> 01:08:08,589
Superman, can you hear me?

745
01:08:08,766 --> 01:08:12,532
- Superman, where?
- Who is this Superman?

746
01:08:12,703 --> 01:08:18,767
- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.

747
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:20,534
I defy you.

748
01:08:20,711 --> 01:08:24,169
Come! Come and kneel before Zod.

749
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:28,050
Zod!

750
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,383
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:35,321
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:39,790
I have to go back.

753
01:08:39,963 --> 01:08:41,931
You can't go back.

754
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:44,624
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:08:44,802 --> 01:08:47,999
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:51,039
It's not your fault.

757
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:54,609
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:08:56,013 --> 01:08:57,844
He knew.

759
01:08:58,015 --> 01:09:00,279
I heard him.

760
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,714
I just didn't listen.

761
01:09:19,369 --> 01:09:21,963
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,106
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:26,765
And the day before.

764
01:09:40,724 --> 01:09:41,918
Hello, there.

765
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:45,393
Lex Luthor.

766
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:49,925
Lex Luthor.

767
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,301
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:56,465
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,267
Wait just a moment.

770
01:09:58,442 --> 01:10:01,570
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:10:01,745 --> 01:10:05,442
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:07,607
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:12,517
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:10:13,023 --> 01:10:17,619
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:22,128
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:26,502
We have all of this without you.

777
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:29,465
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:32,334
Magnificent One...

779
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,711
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,245
The son of Jor-El.

781
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:44,350
The son of Jor-El?

782
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:46,211
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:10:46,723 --> 01:10:49,385
Jor-El, our jailer?

784
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:51,787
No, Jor-El, the baseball player.

785
01:10:51,962 --> 01:10:53,953
Yes, Jor-El, your jailer.

786
01:10:54,264 --> 01:10:57,756
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:10:57,935 --> 01:11:00,529
Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...

788
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:03,798
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:11:03,974 --> 01:11:05,771
Superman.

790
01:11:08,078 --> 01:11:09,739
So this is Superman.

791
01:11:11,081 --> 01:11:12,378
How do you know of Jor-El?

792
01:11:12,549 --> 01:11:16,986
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:19,545
...I'm about the best there is.

794
01:11:19,723 --> 01:11:21,020
Revenge.

795
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:23,182
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,329
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,521
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:30,724
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:35,235
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:38,238
...he's just one...

801
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,968
...where you are three.

802
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:45,113
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:11:45,382 --> 01:11:47,043
Wait!

804
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:49,880
First, you must find him.

805
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:53,486
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:57,516
What do you want?

807
01:11:57,728 --> 01:11:59,855
Well, general...

808
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,590
...the world is a big place.

809
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,200
Thank goodness...

810
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:07,337
...my needs are small.

811
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:14,608
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:12:16,346 --> 01:12:18,837
What do you want?

813
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:20,779
Australia.

814
01:12:52,315 --> 01:12:53,839
Hey.

815
01:12:56,586 --> 01:13:01,046
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:13:38,628 --> 01:13:40,220
Father?

817
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,892
If you can hear me...

818
01:13:46,603 --> 01:13:48,503
...I failed.

819
01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:52,807
I failed you...

820
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:54,873
...I failed myself...

821
01:13:56,746 --> 01:13:58,839
...and all humanity.

822
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:03,912
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:09,822
...for a life of submission in a world
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:14:11,528 --> 01:14:14,019
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,765
...the people of the world.

826
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:19,859
Not since I...

827
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:23,898
Father!

828
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:39,557
Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.

829
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:44,028
If you hear me now...

830
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:47,229
...then you have made use
of the only means left to you:

831
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:52,077
The crystal source through which
our communications begun.

832
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:55,446
The circle is now complete.

833
01:15:55,815 --> 01:15:59,012
You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El.

834
01:16:02,422 --> 01:16:05,949
You did this of your own free will...

835
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:09,290
...in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.

836
01:16:11,597 --> 01:16:13,189
I...

837
01:16:13,366 --> 01:16:17,860
Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.

838
01:16:18,037 --> 01:16:22,940
This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.

839
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:27,772
Look at me, Kal-El.

840
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:34,812
Once before when you were small,
I died...

841
01:16:36,055 --> 01:16:39,024
...while giving you a chance for life.

842
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,118
And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...

843
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:46,662
Father, no.

844
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:50,635
Look at me, Kal-El.

845
01:16:53,373 --> 01:16:58,174
The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.

846
01:16:58,478 --> 01:17:04,007
The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.

847
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:12,423
Farewell forever, Kal-El.

848
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:18,163
Remember me, my son.

849
01:17:48,194 --> 01:17:49,786
My son.

850
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:07,073
Father!

851
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:24,184
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:18:24,363 --> 01:18:27,457
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:29,892
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:18:30,937 --> 01:18:33,667
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,970
...and a big truck with hair on it and a
broad that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:18:38,144 --> 01:18:42,877
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:45,647
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:47,843
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet, chief.

859
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,181
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:52,984
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:56,686
- If there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:18:59,232 --> 01:19:01,496
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:04,101
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:05,802
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:09,465
Oh, my!

866
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:18,243
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:21,716
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:19:33,299 --> 01:19:34,527
This is scary!

869
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:25,743
You all right, chief?

870
01:20:26,252 --> 01:20:27,651
Hi.

871
01:20:29,589 --> 01:20:32,490
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:20:32,658 --> 01:20:33,989
Lex Luthor.

873
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,788
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:20:36,429 --> 01:20:39,262
This is the son of Jor-El?

875
01:20:39,432 --> 01:20:41,332
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:20:42,568 --> 01:20:45,560
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

877
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:48,199
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:20:48,808 --> 01:20:52,403
But what I've given you
is the next best thing.

879
01:20:52,578 --> 01:20:55,604
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:20:55,781 --> 01:20:57,339
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:20:57,516 --> 01:21:01,850
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:04,683
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,255
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:21:08,694 --> 01:21:11,322
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:21:11,831 --> 01:21:13,423
Wait!

886
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:14,964
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:18,267
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:21:20,806 --> 01:21:23,297
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:25,034
Wait. Wait.

890
01:21:25,211 --> 01:21:29,307
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:21:29,882 --> 01:21:31,440
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:44,223
General...

893
01:21:45,131 --> 01:21:47,258
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:21:47,466 --> 01:21:49,491
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:51,834
I mean, get him!

896
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:54,069
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

897
01:21:54,573 --> 01:21:57,406
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:22:12,024 --> 01:22:14,015
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:35,170
Son of Jor-El.

900
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,208
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:39,846
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:43,179
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:22:43,356 --> 01:22:45,722
Like father, like son.

904
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:03,406
Look out!

905
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,243
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:23:19,392 --> 01:23:21,587
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:23:21,861 --> 01:23:23,920
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:01,524
Superman.

909
01:24:22,555 --> 01:24:24,921
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:24:33,632 --> 01:24:35,600
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:24:58,724 --> 01:25:01,887
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:04,695
Help my baby!

913
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:09,261
Thank you.

914
01:25:10,836 --> 01:25:14,397
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:25:14,607 --> 01:25:17,007
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:25:17,176 --> 01:25:18,575
He cares.

917
01:25:18,844 --> 01:25:22,109
He actually cares for these Earth people.

918
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:25,444
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:35,526
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:25:35,694 --> 01:25:37,628
...with some of my own.

921
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,851
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:26:10,296 --> 01:26:11,763
Get out of the way!

923
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:28,031
Superman.

924
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:14,984
Oh, thank you!

925
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:17,714
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:34,030
No! Don't do it!

927
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:36,134
The people!

928
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,576
Throw it!

929
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:07,101
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:14,100
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:29:15,748 --> 01:29:17,739
Superman is dead.

932
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:22,248
They've killed Superman.

933
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:25,987
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:28,752
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:29:29,294 --> 01:29:30,818
Come on!

936
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,888
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:06,462
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:30:11,436 --> 01:30:14,564
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:31:23,475 --> 01:31:25,943
You can't leave us!

940
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:34,949
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:36,878
He's gone.

942
01:31:37,055 --> 01:31:38,579
Come back, Superman!

943
01:31:43,662 --> 01:31:45,323
Don't leave us!

944
01:31:48,233 --> 01:31:50,224
He chickened out.

945
01:31:50,736 --> 01:31:51,794
Phony!

946
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:55,072
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,467
Come on, let's go.

948
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:08,283
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:32:17,296 --> 01:32:19,127
Our victory is complete.

950
01:32:19,298 --> 01:32:21,061
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:23,929
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:28,163
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:31,434
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:33,976
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:37,582
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:32:38,617 --> 01:32:40,676
The next time?

957
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,513
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:46,283
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,756
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:53,261
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:58,633
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:32:58,837 --> 01:33:02,637
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:33:03,075 --> 01:33:05,839
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:10,141
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:12,207
Superman's address?

966
01:33:16,088 --> 01:33:21,424
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:24,460
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:27,655
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:33:28,266 --> 01:33:29,460
What more?

970
01:33:30,435 --> 01:33:31,629
Cuba.

971
01:33:39,644 --> 01:33:45,879
I trust you are not wasting
my time, Lex Luthor.

972
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,314
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:34:34,499 --> 01:34:36,592
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:34:39,504 --> 01:34:41,699
Son of a coward!

975
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,377
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:52,807
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:54,952
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:56,649
Stop.

979
01:34:56,822 --> 01:34:58,813
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:02,221
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:35:02,527 --> 01:35:03,755
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:35:04,129 --> 01:35:06,290
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:10,199
But you are victim to
another fatal weakness...

984
01:35:10,635 --> 01:35:12,068
...your compassion.

985
01:35:12,237 --> 01:35:14,705
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:35:14,873 --> 01:35:16,340
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:35:16,775 --> 01:35:22,304
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:24,640
You will live, Kal-El, forever...

989
01:35:24,816 --> 01:35:29,810
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:35,517
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:37,321
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:43,763
All right, Zod.

993
01:35:44,436 --> 01:35:45,869
It's over.

994
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:52,473
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:56,874
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:00,749
We will destroy this place.

997
01:36:01,253 --> 01:36:02,652
And then kill him.

998
01:36:04,956 --> 01:36:06,821
Him.

999
01:36:07,993 --> 01:36:10,928
Him? Me?

1000
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:14,264
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:36:14,933 --> 01:36:18,494
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,535
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:36:21,072 --> 01:36:25,133
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,777
Silence!

1005
01:36:26,945 --> 01:36:28,537
Well, look...

1006
01:36:31,049 --> 01:36:32,573
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:36:33,185 --> 01:36:35,244
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:36:35,854 --> 01:36:38,982
Promises were made, gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:36:39,157 --> 01:36:42,558
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:45,559
A guy always knew where he stood with you.

1011
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:50,533
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:36:50,702 --> 01:36:52,829
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:36:53,004 --> 01:36:55,598
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:56,968
Now, if you could...

1015
01:37:00,145 --> 01:37:03,342
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:37:03,715 --> 01:37:05,205
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:09,251
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,883
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:14,683
Seize him.

1020
01:37:16,361 --> 01:37:18,488
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:37:18,663 --> 01:37:20,790
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,994
You win.

1023
01:37:26,204 --> 01:37:30,766
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:37:30,942 --> 01:37:33,775
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:37:33,945 --> 01:37:35,640
...activate the machine.

1026
01:37:46,825 --> 01:37:48,816
With your permission.

1027
01:39:01,966 --> 01:39:04,833
And now, finally...

1028
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:10,701
Kneel.

1029
01:39:15,213 --> 01:39:17,613
Take my hand...

1030
01:39:17,816 --> 01:39:23,584
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:05,026
He switched it.

1032
01:40:05,663 --> 01:40:07,597
He did it to them.

1033
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:13,737
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:40:15,106 --> 01:40:17,097
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:40:17,442 --> 01:40:19,569
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:31,318
Are you all right?

1037
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,221
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:38,559
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:42,791
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:40:42,967 --> 01:40:45,128
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:47,804
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:40:48,072 --> 01:40:51,269
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:40:51,709 --> 01:40:53,677
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:40:53,845 --> 01:40:56,177
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:40:56,347 --> 01:40:59,612
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:42:16,828 --> 01:42:18,386
Look, Lois...

1047
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:21,829
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,594
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:42:27,505 --> 01:42:31,168
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:42:33,344 --> 01:42:36,074
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:42:36,247 --> 01:42:38,647
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:47,524
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:42:49,894 --> 01:42:52,158
But it just can't be...

1054
01:43:14,619 --> 01:43:16,849
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:19,054
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:43:43,548 --> 01:43:46,711
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:43:47,919 --> 01:43:51,377
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:43:51,556 --> 01:43:55,458
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:01,288
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:44:08,973 --> 01:44:10,235
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:44:10,808 --> 01:44:12,400
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:44:13,678 --> 01:44:17,239
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:44:42,473 --> 01:44:44,873
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:47,778
Up, up and away.

1065
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:16,029
- No!
- No!

1066
01:46:43,394 --> 01:46:45,521
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:46:45,696 --> 01:46:49,632
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:47:05,983 --> 01:47:08,178
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:47:08,352 --> 01:47:10,684
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:47:10,855 --> 01:47:12,584
That's what they said.

1071
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:16,593
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:47:22,266 --> 01:47:23,893
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:47:29,607 --> 01:47:31,438
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:47:31,609 --> 01:47:34,339
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:47:34,512 --> 01:47:37,743
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:47:38,716 --> 01:47:40,911
The North Pole.

1077
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:43,711
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:47:44,689 --> 01:47:50,286
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:47:50,628 --> 01:47:52,459
No, you never did.

1080
01:47:53,264 --> 01:47:58,964
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the
single most important story of my career...

1081
01:47:59,136 --> 01:48:01,229
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:48:01,772 --> 01:48:05,367
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:48:05,543 --> 01:48:08,808
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the world or saved the universe.

1084
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:12,916
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:48:13,084 --> 01:48:15,780
Now, there's some
things that you can do too.

1086
01:48:16,787 --> 01:48:18,379
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:48:18,556 --> 01:48:21,320
Really? Like what?

1088
01:48:22,827 --> 01:48:24,021
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:48:24,795 --> 01:48:28,526
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,525
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:48:31,702 --> 01:48:33,636
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:48:33,804 --> 01:48:35,237
I'm going.

1093
01:48:40,411 --> 01:48:41,844
Lois?

1094
01:48:42,313 --> 01:48:43,610
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:48:44,882 --> 01:48:48,318
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:52,512
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:49:14,211 --> 01:49:16,611
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:49:16,781 --> 01:49:18,578
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1099
01:49:18,749 --> 01:49:21,513
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:25,348
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:49:26,657 --> 01:49:30,991
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:49:39,036 --> 01:49:42,938
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:49:43,107 --> 01:49:44,438
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1104
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,843
Now cool it, Rocky.

01:49:52,016 --> 01:49:53,142
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:49:53,317 --> 01:49:56,753
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:50:13,371 --> 01:50:15,464
Oh, God!

1108
01:50:27,184 --> 01:50:29,311
This order's to go.

1109
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:40,929
I'm terribly sorry about
all the damage, sir.

1110
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:47,202
I've been working out.
