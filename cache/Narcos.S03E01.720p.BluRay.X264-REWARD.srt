1
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:24,233
'Thank you for being here
with us, with the groom and the bride.

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,278
'Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,741
'As they say, here we have
the most beautiful women in Laredo.'

4
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,993
- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:34,910
Congratulations.

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,015
The last time I saw Danny, he was riding
a big wheel down the sidewalk.

7
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,601
It means a lot to your <i>tía</i>
that you're here.

8
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

9
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,479
How are you, sir?

10
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,355
- Javi.
- Hey, Luis.

11
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,400
We heard about what you did in Colombia.
We sure are proud of you.

12
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,070
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

13
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,571
Hello, Paco.

14
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,119
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

15
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,412
Hey!

16
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,295
Be right back, Pops.

17
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,217
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- Yummy!

18
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,177
Hey, Lorraine.

19
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,890
Javi. Heard you were back.

20
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,184
I mean, the whole town's talking about it.

21
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,146
- I had some time off.
- Decided to spend it here?

22
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,236
Actually, I'm...

23
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,072
trying to quit.

24
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,199
Doing the Nicorette thing.

25
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,910
Look at you. A whole new man.

26
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,294
Listen, Lorraine...

27
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,842
I just wanted to say
I've thought about things...

28
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,719
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

29
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,805
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

30
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,849
I know what I did.

31
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,394
I was... um...

32
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,357
It was wrong.

33
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,778
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

34
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,072
The truth is, I'm grateful.

35
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,033
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

36
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,161
Maybe we both did.

37
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,539
If you hadn't come into my life
and disappeared from it,

38
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,291
none of that would have
ever happened.

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,711
Can you imagine
if we were actually married?

40
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,258
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,635
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

42
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,470
- How are you?
- Good.

43
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,265
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,391
Yeah.

45
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,352
You hungry?

46
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,647
Oh, you are getting so big.

47
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,622
I know you didn't like it tonight,
all the attention, but...

48
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,833
folks want to pay their respects.

49
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,585
You're a hero to them.

50
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,714
I'm not a hero.

51
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,531
Will you tell me something?

52
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,079
What happened to you over there?

53
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,540
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

54
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,720
When you were a kid, a little guy,

55
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,517
all you wanted to do was get out of here,
out into the world.

56
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,561
But you didn't like what you found.

57
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,522
A lot of people don't.

58
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,066
But don't try to change it.

59
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,404
More likely, it'll change you.

60
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,032
It was right here, wasn't it?

61
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,869
The last time we had this conversation.

62
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,455
You didn't listen to me then, either.

63
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,833
Nope.

64
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,215
So, Cali.

65
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,679
Cali.

66
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,945
Sir, here you are.

67
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,780
Thank you.

68
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,124
'I'm not a hero.

69
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,377
'There were some
in the hunt for Escobar.

70
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,337
'A lot, actually.

71
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,631
'But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.

72
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,261
'To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.

73
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,389
'If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.

74
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:11,890
'It's what we do.

75
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,438
'The enemy of my enemy is my friend,
until he becomes my enemy again.

76
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,399
'When that happens, God help them.

77
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,821
'The day Pablo went down, the Cali cartel
became Public Enemy Number One.

78
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,324
'And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.'

79
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,537
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

80
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,873
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

81
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,291
'And that's exactly
what happened.

82
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,334
'While the whole world
was focused on Escobar,

83
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,130
'Cali's operations
had grown exponentially,

84
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,591
'differing from their rival
in every possible way.

85
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,970
'Where Pablo sought the love and
protection of the masses of Medellín,

86
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,306
'these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite

87
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,100
'and called themselves
"The Gentlemen of Cali".

88
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,605
'And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,

know it was Cali coke they were moving.

Yes. What's up?

'Chepe Santacruz-Londoño.'

102

'He actually lived there,
under an assumed name, of course.

107

Miguel Rodríguez.'

108
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,295
Palmira's police superintendent.

109
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,547
Didn't we just take care of him?

110
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,633
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

111
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,385
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

112
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,471
Put 17.

113

- Seventeen?
- Yes.

evolution. Apex drug dealers.

Move all that over to the left.

127

The tables are too close together.

128
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,403
Are you planning on saying
anything tonight?

129
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,989
No.

130
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,825
I'll speak for the both of us.

131
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,453
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

132
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,914
And?

133
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,542
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

134
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,962
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

135
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,676
You're more superstitious
than Aunt Luz.

136
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,955
- Hey, boss.
- Is everything ready?

137
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,248
Yes, sir.

138
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,252
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

139
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,630
You can handle it, you're young.

140
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,890
We're meeting Córdova.
He wants to go over the game plan.

141
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,101
Big night tonight, right?

142
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Lots of company.

143
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,664
Gentlemen.
Let's start with the obvious.

144
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,333
Tonight is fucking important.

145
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,877
The Rodríguez brothers never

146
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,630
gather members of their organisation
in one place.

147
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,843
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

148
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,929
So we have to be sharp.

149
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,641
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,686
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

151
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,188
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

152
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,566
Tonight is his last operation.

153
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,612
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

154
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,451
Let's leave a good impression.
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

155
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,245
Let's go.

156
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,756
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

157
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,217
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

158
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,138
I have no idea.
After Friday, it's not my problem.

159
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,058
- Are you really leaving?
- I promised Paola.

160
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,397
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

161
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,234
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

162
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,987
I hope so, buddy.

163
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,948
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

164
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,503
'Congratulations on the promotion, sir.'

165
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,755
Tell me what you do again.

166
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,591
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

167
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,760
I drive myself.

168
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,140
You know, you're kind of a big deal
around here. Since Escobar.

169
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,726
- Katie.
- Good morning.

170
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,606
Sir, can I ask?

171
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,775
What was Escobar like?

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,194
Never met him.

173
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,907
'Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years

174
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,785
'didn't mean we were completely
ignoring the Cali godfathers.'

175
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,121
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

176
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,248
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,927
Those are our intelligence summaries
on the Cali cartel.

178
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,596
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

179
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,516
'We had agents on them
the whole time.

180
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,268
'Good agents.

181
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,771
'And recently, we had gotten lucky.'

182
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,942
You got some kind of medical condition?

183
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,279
No, I got one.

184
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,239
'The latest break
in the case against Cali

185
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,909
'came from a joint Customs-DEA
operation called Cornerstone.

186
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,665
'And it put a lot of mid-level Cali guys
behind bars in the States.

187
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,086
'And while they weren't eager to help us,

188
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,006
'you could always count
on some poor relative in Colombia...'

189
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,344
'...who would do whatever it takes
to get their brother or son back home.'

190
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,430
Who am I speaking with?

191
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,432
'And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.'

192
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,183
This is Andres, his brother.

193
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,102
'The DEA doesn't fuck around.'

194
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,104
And how can I help him?

195
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,951
Here we go.

196
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,372
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

197
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,169
Something to drink?

198
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,258
You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

199
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,093
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

200
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,387
Relax. You're safe here.

201
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,222
Lay it on him.

202
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,642
Let's talk about tonight's party.

203
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,353
We need info on the people attending.

204
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,480
Cops, politicians.

205
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,357
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

206
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,569
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

207
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,113
And the why. Tell him.

208
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:53,370
Look, the thing is, these people
never get together in one place.

209
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,164
We need to know why now.

210
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,583
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

211
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,461
is making some kind
of important announcement.

212
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,797
Understand?

213
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,385
If no... bye-bye,<i>hermano.</i>

214
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,395
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

215
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,316
How's the family? You know,
you had a few more weeks off coming.

216
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,068
You could've spent more time at home.

217
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,529
Yeah, well, I guess they couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

218
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,452
Sir, this operation in Miami,
Cornerstone, shook some leads loose.

219
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,121
Could be a break on Cali.

220
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,750
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

221
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,921
Could shed some light
on their next move.

222
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,595
Things won't be like Escobar,
Agent Peña.

223
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,974
It can't be.
Things have changed down here.

224
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,434
New President coming in.

225
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,228
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

226
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,566
Just take it a little slowly.

227
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,444
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

228
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,949
Sir, the CIA station chief...

229
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,952
he and I have history.

230
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,663
I'm hoping it won't be an issue
moving forward.

231
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,665
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

232
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,376
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

233
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,587
Stechner signed off
on your appointment.

234
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,339
In fact, he wanted you back.

235
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,886
The CIA and the DEA need
to work together on this one.

236
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,512
We have the same goal.

237
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,531
Come in.

238
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,287
<i>Hola,</i> brother.

239
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,457
We were starting to worry.
Everything cool?

240
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,710
We were getting worried.
Everything okay?

241
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,129
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

242
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,174
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

243
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,384
I had to make sure I was alone.

244
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,137
Let's get you suited up, my man.
Run through the plan again.

245
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,681
Take off your shirt. Sit.

246
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,689
Okay. Ready. We're good to go.

247
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:20,952
Look, don't you think you
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

248
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,706
He's a boss.

249
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,750
We're in their territory, right?

250
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,048
Yes. Yes.

251
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,967
I'll fix it tonight.

252
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,260
María.

253
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,470
María.

254
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,102
For our children,
and our children's children.

255
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,688
That sounded great, brother.

256
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,900
Let me do it from the top.

257
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,279
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

258
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,990
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

259
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,201
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

260
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,038
What's up?

261
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,790
Look at you. How's New York?

262
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,170
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

263
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,506
I brought you something, baby-face.

264
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,802
Lovely. Thanks.

265
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,683
It's been too long
since we were all together.

266
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,023
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

267
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,110
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

268
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,280
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

269
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,117
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

270
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,663
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

271
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,624
- But I work harder than him.
- Cheers, then!

272
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,626
To the Pope!

273
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,586
Cheers.

274
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,296
Welcome, Chepe.

275
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:04,472
Look, Gilberto...
you know I have a personal issue

276
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,892
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

277
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,563
And he's downstairs.
I would like to solve it.

278
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,068
Okay, Pacho.

279
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:22,740
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

280
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,201
There's too much at stake.

281
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,790
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

282
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,794
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

283
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,171
Chepe, you motherfucker.

284
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,777
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

285
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,698
I pay him money every month.

286
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,868
I pay all these people.

287
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:11,247
Well done, big shot.
It's not your money.

288
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,166
But I'm the one who controls it.

289
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,752
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

290
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,962
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

291
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,260
Watch it.

292
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,277
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

293
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,321
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

294
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,657
Yes.

295
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,243
Nice to see you.

296
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,246
Don Gilberto, good evening.

297
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,957
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

298
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,920
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

299
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,595
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

300
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,776
Hello.

301
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,820
- Good evening.
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

302
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,072
- Of course.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,009
Are you...

304
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,304
...enjoying yourself?

305
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,932
Yes. Very much, thank you.

306
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,191
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

307
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,693
María Salazar.

308
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,279
Thank you for having us.

309
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,968
Good evening.

310
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,803
Mister Rodríguez would like
for his associates

311
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,930
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

312
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,849
Please, go right ahead.

313
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,853
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables.

314
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,771
Thank you.

315
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,777
Stop there.

316
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,072
You must be using
some high-end equipment

317
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,325
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

318
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,952
Who are you?

319
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,538
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

320
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,459
See that man over there?
His name is Navegante.

321
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,629
Guess what he does?

322
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,051
Either you come with me,
or you go with him. You understand?

323
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,846
Follow me.

324
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,949
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

325
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,034
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

326
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,621
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

327
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,333
Your brother is Lucho.

328
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,294
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

329
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,214
That's why you agreed
to work for the DEA.

330
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,966
Don't lie to me.

331
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,969
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

332
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,514
But I think you're smart enough
to realise that.

333
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,060
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

334
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,271
Leave Cali.

335
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,067
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

336
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,153
I need you to disappear.

337
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,994
Associates, friends.

338
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,955
Our enemy is dead!

339
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,626
Our business is strong!

340
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,838
Together we have taken this business

341
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,466
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

342
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:39,265
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

343
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,608
- Stoddard!
- 'Listen to me.

344
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:55,781
'The law enforcement spotlight will shine
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.

345
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,994
'And so, while we celebrate,

346
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,957
'they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.

347
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:13,174
An American named Joseph Kennedy
made his fortune selling bootlegged liquor,

348
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,968
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

349
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,220
His children, great politicians.

350
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,932
And one of them was
even elected president.

351
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,396
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

352
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,273
and soon we will reach an agreement.

353
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,493
Our organisation, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

354
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,747
We will surrender our labs,

355
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,124
our safe houses,

356
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,710
and our trafficking routes.

357
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:56,175
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

358
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,970
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

359
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,306
Our money will remain ours.

360
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,810
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

361
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:10,481
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

362
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,151
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

363
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,532
we'll give each of you a juicy share

364
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,660
of the final profits from this year.

365
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,920
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

366
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,049
For our children...
and our children's children!

367
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,554
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

368
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,390
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

369
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,643
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

370
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,189
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

371
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,195
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

372
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,882
What would you like?

373
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,300
Whiskey. Dry.

374
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,723
Hey, sir!

375
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,977
We were wondering
if we could get you a drink.

376
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,188
I'm good. Thanks.

377
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,066
Okay.

378
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,447
Six months.

379
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,241
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

380
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,704
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

381
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,128
And then what?

382
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,175
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

383
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,060
Hello.

384
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,650
I love you, brother.

385
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,696
I'll see you on the dance floor.

386
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,760
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

387
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,220
Because it's time, okay?

388
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,266
- Why are you treating me like this?
- That's enough! Get in the car.

389
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,795
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

390
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,171
Very good, sir.

391
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,844
Do you think we surprised them?

392
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,264
Yes. I think you surprised
many people.

393
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,729
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

394
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,151
Don't be modest.

395
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,570
Córdova told me.

396
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,072
It's your talent.

397
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,743
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

398
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,121
It's priceless.

399
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,544
I'm told you want to leave.

400
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,635
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

401
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,348
I'm starting my own security firm.

402
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:18,354
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

403
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,942
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

404
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,528
You have done great things for us
over the years.

405
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,490
For my family. For me.

406
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,453
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

407
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,884
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

408
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,511
Arrangements can change.

409
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:56,392
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

410
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,230
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

411
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,817
It's only six months.

412
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,405
Can I count on you, Jorge?

413
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,158
Yes?

414
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,205
Of course, boss.

415
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,666
Miguel.

416
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,230
Pretty girl.

417
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,401
Displays some shaky judgment
in men, though.

418
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,990
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

419
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,367
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

420
00:33:55,492 --> 00:34:00,205
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

421
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,041
The same.

422
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,751
So?

423
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,878
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

424
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:10,174
Did indeed.
Because you know how things work.

425
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,259
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

426
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,432
To the folks back in D.C.,
Escobar was a win.

427
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,641
Thanks.

428
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:24,480
But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

429
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,317
Medellín was a failure.
Thousands of Colombians dead.

430
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,236
And coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

431
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:35,115
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

432
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,207
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

433
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
We do Cali differently.

434
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,548
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

435
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,384
America's got plans for Colombia.

436
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,846
Another bloodbath complicates them.

437
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,268
So...

438
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,396
what's the play?

439
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,318
Surrender.
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

440
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,738
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

441
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,534
As far as I'm concerned,
the DEA can even take the credit.

442
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,327
And these fucking guys walk?

443
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,625
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,
but it has backing from Washington.

444
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,381
So what the fuck do you need me for?

445
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,551
Well, you're the dashing DEA agent
that took down Escobar.

446
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,971
Always helps to have a hero on board.

447
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,766
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

448
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,394
Technically speaking.

449
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,606
And that's enough for you?

450
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:54,862
If there were any justice in this world,
Javier, you'd be in jail.

451
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,787
I know your guys are running
an operation on Cali tonight.

452
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,623
Please.

453
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,004
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

454
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,092
These guys don't make mistakes.

455
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,596
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

456
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,579
I don't know, man.

457
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,748
I met him at an embassy thing
about a year ago.

458
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,665
Yeah?

459
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,834
Couldn't drink it or fuck it,
dude wasn't interested.

460
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,548
I hear you.
I mean, he's not a bad guy.

461
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,469
He was in my class at the Academy.

462
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,646
Kid's been gone eight hours.
He better have something good.

463
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,326
Fucking retard.

464
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,587
Something's up.

465
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,572
Maybe he got made.
Or just spooked.

466
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,198
Either way, we stay here tonight.

467
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,951
- Head out when it's light.
- Yeah.

468
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,840
Does Andrés have this number?

469
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,594
We don't know the phone number.
How could he?

470
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,224
Answer it.

471
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:18,982
Hello? Hello?
Who is this?

472
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,569
Hang up!
And get away from the fucking window!

473
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,657
They're fucking watching us.

474
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,704
'Turns out that break from
Cornerstone wasn't much of a break.

475
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,832
'Cali spent a billion dollars a year
on payoffs.

476

He asked me not to leave.

540
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,262
Just for a little while.

541
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,847
How long?

542
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,018
I'm asking you how long.

543
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,562
- Six months.
- Six months?

544
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,316
What did you tell him?

545
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,113
What could I tell him? It's six months.

546

We've talked about this
for a long time.

547

You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

548
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,959
You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

549
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,378
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

550
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:18,133
You like working for them.
It's become your life, Jorge.

551
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:22,053
You are my life. The girls are my life.

552
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,265
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

553
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,059
- It's six months, not six years.
- Not another word.

554
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,996
- She owns a spa.
- Let's go. We should go!

555
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,456
What can I get you?

556
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,543

You know what, Pacho?

00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:57,166
I think our differences
are in the past.

564
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:06,426
I'll be right back to share it with you.
Excuse me.

Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

Please, let's talk. Pacho!

575

Motherfucker.
He didn't do anything to you.
