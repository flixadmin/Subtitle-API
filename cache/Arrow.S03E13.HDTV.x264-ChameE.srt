325
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,001
I will, if you answer
one question.

326
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:44,504
Where are the Yamashiros?

327
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:58,018
The ferry to Shanghai.

328
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,893
[Knock on door]
Knock knock.

329
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,063
Hey.

330
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,932
You know, half
the department

331
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,001
is still talking about
the way you clocked that marshal.

332
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,870
[Chuckles] Those boxing lessons
look like they're paying off.

333
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,740
Yeah, I guess so.
Uh, are those the cargo manifests

334
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,608
for the whole city?
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,510
Although, you know, I got to ask, what
do you need these for?

336
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,046
Just a RICO case that
I'm second chairing.

337
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:28,682
Right.

338
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,585
Dad?
Yeah, sorry.

339
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,053
I just...[Sighs]

340
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,222
Have you heard
from Sara lately?

341
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:37,324
No. Why?

342
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,894
I ran into her
a few weeks back.

343
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:45,332
And something just felt
a little...off.

344
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:48,226
Then I ran into
that friend of hers.

345
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,395
You know, the one
with the, uh, the boy hair?

346
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,663
Sin.

347
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,764
Yeah, Sin, that's it.

348
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,334
She said something strange.

349
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,373
She said that the woman
in black isn't Sara.

350
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,778
That doesn't
make any sense.

351
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,747
No.

352
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,484
I mean, look, I just
want to talk to her,

353
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,252
you know, Sara or not.

354
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,090
But look, don't worry,
I said I'd start taking it easy,

355
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,092
I meant it.

356
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,561
I'll get out of your hair.

357
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,043
Now I've been
wondering,

358
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,745
how do you decide between
the red hoodie

359
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,814
and the one
with the mask?

360
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,992
I'm glad you know.

361
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,951
I feel pretty lame

362
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,685
for not recognizing
my own brother

363
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,186
just because he's
wearing a hood.

364
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,722
I can't believe you
knew before I did.

365
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,891
He saved my life, Thea.

366
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,695
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

367
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,632
He thinks we need
Merlyn's help.

368
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,833
Hmm.

369
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,601
And what do you think?

370
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,072
I think I want
to get as far away

371
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,774
from Malcolm Merlyn
as I possibly can.

372
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,443
Well, there's your answer
right there.

373
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,145
Hey.

374
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,547
Sorry.

375
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,815
May I borrow him
for a second?

376
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,783
[Scoffs] Apparently,

377
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,586
he's been more yours
than mine lately, so...

378
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,062
What happened?

379
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,565
One of our trackers sent a signal from
the Starling City docks.

380
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,701
Except we don't have
any tracking devices in the field.

381
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,037
Unless we do.

382
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,306
It's Laurel.

383
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,608
You tagged Laurel
with a tracer?

384
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,211
If she's going to be reckless,
I need to know what she's doing.

385
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,279
Well, she's definitely
doing something.

386
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,583
I'm just not exactly sure how
reckless it is.

387
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,986
I ran the manifests on all these shipping
containers that you see here.

388
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,656
One of these leads back
to Zytle's old supplier.

00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,624
Looks like Vertigo's
back in business.

to get herself killed.

No. We need this.
Oliver, you were gone.

Dead. At least
we thought you were,

and we had to go on
with our lives.

Fine! I'm back now.

that we can go back.

Oliver.

Are you all right?

488
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,945
I told them
you were on the ferry.

489

I'm sorry.

490

They tortured you.

491
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,684
I sold you out.

492
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,553
No, you didn't.

493
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,788
Because we were
never going to Shanghai.

494
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,291
I lied.

A precaution just in case
you were captured.

496
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,762
Then how'd they find you?

497
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,331
They didn't.
When I found out you'd been taken,

498
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,396
I came back.

499

You're an idiot.

Maybe.

But I will not let you face Waller
alone for my actions.

502
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:14,840
So now we're both going
to get tortured, or worse.

503
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,042
Great plan.

504
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:22,147
I must speak
with Agent Waller.

When Zytle hit me
with Vertigo, I--

512
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,808
I saw Sara.

513
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,979
She was alive.

514
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:58,417
And she was
calling me a fraud.

515
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,019
I was crazy to think
that I was fit

516
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,156
to wear Sara's jacket.

517

Much less follow
in her footsteps.

You're right.

I hope I'm not
out of line here,

520

but...

521
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:20,372
I think Sara wore her mask
just as much to hide her demons

522
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,408
as she did to help people.

523
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,145
And I don't see that with you.

You have a light
inside of you

that Sara never had.

526

So...

527
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:40,325
Maybe you should
stop trying to be Sara...

528

00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:33,985
is about Sara.

651
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,758
No.

652
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,261
Dad...

653
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,897
No.

654
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,733
No.
Dad...

655
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,035
Daddy, I'm sorry.

656
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:53,037
Not my baby, not again.

657
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,473
[Both sobbing]

658
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,842
I'm so sorry.

659
00:37:57,844 --> 00:37:59,677
I can't do this.

660
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, God, please.

661
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,652
[Door opens]

662
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,355
Oliver: Thea?

663
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,059
It's ok. You're ok.

664
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:19,397
I thought that
I was stronger.

665
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:23,401
I thought that I could
keep myself safe.

666
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,972
Who was he?

667
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:30,708
Malcolm:
One of Ra's agents.

668
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,577
Roy...

669
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,979
Could you give us a minute?

670
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,788
Really hope you're not
expecting a thank you.

671
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,458
No parent needs gratitude for
saving their child.

672
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:51,529
I didn't ask
to be a part of this.

673
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:55,600
I didn't ask for any of this.

674
00:38:55,602 --> 00:39:00,204
[Sighs] Maybe you're right.

675
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,941
Maybe we can't do this
without him.

676
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:10,982
But I am never going
to forget the things you've done.

677
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,551
Or the person that you are.

678
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:15,053
Understood.

679
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:17,655
But before
we can begin,

680
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:21,926
there's something
that only the two of you can do.

681
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,529
Ra's al Ghul preys
upon the fears of his enemies.

682
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,365
Conquer your own fear,

683
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,868
and you eliminate that
critical advantage.

684
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,672
For you, there is
only one place

685
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:39,110
on earth uniquely
suited to doing that.

686
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:40,711
So you're leaving again?

687
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,513
She's got a point, man.
You just got back.

688
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,549
It's just
for a few days.

689
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,784
Ordinarily,
I wouldn't do this.

690
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,921
But it's for Thea.

691
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:51,622
And if you've
shown me anything,

692
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:56,694
it's that the city
is more than safe in your hands.

693
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:59,197
All of your hands.

694
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,701
Thank you.

695
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,951
Ollie told you we're heading
out for a bit?

696
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,887
You cool with it all?

697
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,257
[Exhales]
After the whole chase thing,

698
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,692
I think it's going
to be a little while

699
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:30,128
before I'm cool
with anything.

700
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,101
[Chuckles]

701
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,036
What was that for?

702
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:41,873
Take your pick.
Saving my life,

703
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,842
or standing up to Oliver
about Malcolm.

704
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:50,414
I should get going.

705
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:53,151
[Exhales]

706
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,824
Oliver: Come on, Speedy,
we have four more miles

707
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:02,460
to make
before night fall.

708
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,562
Ah, God.

709
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,064
I get that Malcolm
wants to whip us into shape

710
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,700
so we can face the League,
but don't you think

711
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:11,969
it's a little bit excessive?

712
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,805
We've been here for two hours.
Are you complaining already?

713
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:19,177
I--I started thinking it
after the first ten minutes.

714
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:22,346
Well, give it time.

715
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:24,682
Eventually this place
will feel like home.

716
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:27,185
It does not look like home.

717
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:30,321
It was for me.
For other people,

718
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:33,691
this is Purgatory.

719
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,697
You're not dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

720
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:42,600
Once again, you have
the good fortune

721
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:45,203
of being uniquely
qualified to help me.

722
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,305
Me? Why?

723
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:51,242
Chen Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
We've tracked here here.

724
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:55,346
Here? Where are we--

725
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,617
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.
