1
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,643
Stay down!

2
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,090
Don't move!

3
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:50,563
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,303 --> 00:00:58,969
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the <i>Sawyer-Two.</i>

5
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,839
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:02,570
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,374
<i>They say everybody's</i>
<i>good at something.</i>

8
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,546
<i>Me? I talk to fish.</i>

9
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,145
<i>That's how I met</i>
<i>my friend, Storm.</i>

10
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,887
<i>He's always there</i>
<i>when I need a lift.</i>

11
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,633
<i>Some people</i>
<i>think that makes me a joke.</i>

12
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:34,438
<i>But I don't care.</i>
<i>You know why?</i>

13
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,136
<i>'Cause I'm also good</i>
<i>at something else.</i>

14
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,179
<i>And that's breaking heads.</i>

15
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,019
Pow! Papa took on
all the pirates.

16
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:53,937
I was like,
"Well, the pirates think that..."

17
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,617
Hi-ya!

18
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:56,824
Papa kicked their butts.

19
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,846
Those chum lickers
didn't stand a chance.

20
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,799
Ooh!

21
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,005
<i>Papa kicked their asses</i>
<i>and took their names.</i>

22
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,275
Yeah! Come on!

23
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,833
Watch out.

24
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,343
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

25
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,554
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>this is my son, Arthur Jr.</i>

26
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,120
<i>See, four years ago,</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>

27
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:30,692
<i>I met a woman, fell in love,</i>
<i>and the next thing I know,</i>

28
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:32,347
<i>we're getting married</i>
<i>and having a kid.</i>

29
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,598
<i>This little guy's the best thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to me.</i>

30
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:43,242
<i>But this kid, he doesn't sleep.</i>

31
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,377
What you got in there, huh?

32
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:49,043
Okay...

33
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:51,622
<i>And he never misses.</i>

34
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,011
What the...

35
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,950
<i>And then,</i>
<i>I'm up at the crack of dawn</i>

36
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,894
<i>because on top of getting</i>
<i>married and having a kid...</i>

37
00:02:56,918 --> 00:03:00,187
<i>I finally got a job.</i>

38
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:03,423
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>I'm the king of freaking Atlantis.</i>

39
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:08,596
<i>How did I score that, you asked?</i>

40
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,433
<i>Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,</i>

41
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:12,998
<i>from attacking the surface world.</i>

42
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,934
<i>And in doing so,</i>
<i>I claimed the throne from him.</i>

43
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:18,340
<i>At first I was all like...</i>

44
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,809
Yeah!

45
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,954
The territorial waters
are long held...

46
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,647
<i>But then, as it turned out,</i>

47
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:26,583
<i>being king wasn't all</i>
<i>it was cracked up to be.</i>

48
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,615
<i>It's just meetings all day and politics.</i>

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,030
<i>I'm so bored, I don't even know</i>
<i>which end of the Brine King</i>

50
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,790
<i>I'm supposed to be looking at</i>
<i>half the time.</i>

51
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:37,895
Whoo!

52
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,364
Yeah! That was awesome!

53
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,099
<i>And if that's not bad enough,</i>

54
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,331
<i>turns out there's this whole</i>
<i>Council of Houses thing</i>

55
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,166
<i>that nobody told me about.</i>

56
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,066
<i>Which basically gets to shoot</i>
<i>down everything I want to do.</i>

57
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,881
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that makes all the hard work</i>

58
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,978
<i>and sleepless nights worthwhile</i>
<i>is hanging with my little man.</i>

59
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,944
Hey!
You missed me!

60
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,378
<i>But of course,</i>
<i>there are fun parts of the job.</i>

61
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,924
Whoa!

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
<i>I get to keep the sea safe</i>
<i>the best way I know how.</i>

63
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:14,762
<i>Especially when I get to</i>
<i>take down an illegal cage fight or two.</i>

64
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,535
<i>But for everything I get right,</i>

65
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,469
<i>something else gets screwed up.</i>

66
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:35,854
Ah, fu...

67
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,398
<i>♪ Born to be wild ♪</i>

68
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:03,778
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.

69
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,515
<i>Cheers.</i>

70
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,894
So...

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,931
he's gonna need a little brother
or sister to play with.

72
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,070
He's got a dog.

73
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,738
Hey, I'm serious.

74
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:33,075
I saw how lonely it was
for you growing up.

75
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,677
An only child.

76
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:39,077
I always regretted
I couldn't give you that.

77
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:42,511
Yeah, well,
don't be too hard on yourself.

78
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,151
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dick bag.

79
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,624
Come on.

80
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,790
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

81
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:54,498
Sure, siblings bicker
and fight...

82
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,931
but at the end of the day,
they're family.

83
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,805
You should be able
to count on them for help.

84
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:05,404
Yeah, well, I'll still take
the dog over him any day.

85
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:13,518
Hey, look at that.

86
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,431
Holy crap.

87
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:35,199
Hi, baby boy.
Are you talking to the fishies?

88
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:42,375
Oh, man.
Pops, this is blowing my mind.

89
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:45,714
My whole life I've wanted
to share this gift with someone.

90
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,982
Yeah, but you and me, son,
we're different.

91
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:51,752
We're special.

92
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,850
We're connected
to the land and the sea.

93
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:58,793
I can't wait to introduce you to all the
majestic creatures on our planet.

94
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:02,165
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

95
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,634
Yeah, you and me.

96
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,892
I cross-referenced
the coordinates from Dr. Shin.

97
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,355
Nothing.

98
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,796
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants
under the ice.

99
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,534
Looks like he's led us
on another wild goose chase.

100
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,948
Every day I don't fix
my power suit

101
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,084
is another day Aquaman
gets to live.

102
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,957
Check again.

103
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,829
We're close this time.
I can feel it.

104
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:51,438
Expedition log day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

105
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,139
My quest for Atlantis has brought
me to the ends of the earth.

106
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,116
David Kane
is losing his patience.

107
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:01,783
If I don't turn up the Atlantean technology
he's looking for soon,

108
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,349
they're probably going to...
um...

109
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,132
You know what,
let's not even go there.

110
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,657
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

111
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,971
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

112
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,543
Please tell me
you found something.

113
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,445
Seismic array is going crazy.

114
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,979
Where's the epicenter?

115
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:32,948
We're standing on it.

116
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,808
Run!

117
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:48,124
What just happened?
An earthquake?

118
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,697
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

119
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:30,901
Come on. Get up.

120
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,873
I think I broke my ankle!
Come on. Let's go!

121
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,369
Come on, get up.
Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

122
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,505
Come on, we gotta move!
Come on!

123
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:05,397
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

124
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,133
What the hell happened to you?

125
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,565
There's something back there.

126
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:58,151
Astounding.

127
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,288
My readings show
something's down here.

128
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:03,088
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

129
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:07,425
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

130
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,461
How is this place
even possible?

131
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,079
This was all probably solid ice

132
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:15,204
until we started
heating the planet.

133
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,407
Well, thank God
for global warming, am I right?

134
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:21,946
Uh, yeah,
that's not exactly a good thing.

135
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,361
The tracks lead down there.

136
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,563
Suit up.

137
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,704
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

138
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,876
the monster's down there.

139
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:58,477
Okay. I guess
we're going down there.

140
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,339
I don't believe this.

141
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,781
It's a structure of some kind.

142
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,413
And there's more buried
in the ice.

143
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,617
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

144
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:39,287
Everyone, fan out and search.
Yes, sir.

145
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:42,488
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

146
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:48,432
This has to be
a few thousand years old.

147
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,166
Astounding.

148
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,009
Whoa.

149
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,044
Uh...

150
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:41,618
Ow...

151
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:00,135
What is this place?

152
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:07,441
<i>At last, you are here.</i>

153
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,009
Free me from my prison

154
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:42,147
and I will grant you
the strength

155
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:45,981
<i>to kill the man</i>
<i>who murdered your father.</i>

156
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,784
You can't leave him like this!

157
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,711
You ask the sea for mercy.

158
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:51,516
Get out of here!
You need to live

159
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,986
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

160
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:58,494
<i>You will take</i>
<i>from him what he stole from you.</i>

161
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,367
<i>His home will burn</i>

162
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:08,667
<i>and his kingdom will fall</i>
<i>before my legions.</i>

163
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,174
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

164
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,714
David. No, David.

165
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,210
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

166
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,718
David. David, it's okay.

167
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,220
You're all right.

168
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,289
What the hell is that thing?

169
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,933
<i>Just unbelievable footage</i>

170
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,857
<i>coming in from all around the world.</i>

171
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:45,917
<i>Good evening, folks.</i>

172
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,123
<i>In the past five months,</i>

173
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:49,147
<i>we've seen an extraordinary</i>
<i>rise in temperatures</i>

174
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,211
<i>reported around the world.</i>

175
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:54,912
<i>And that has resulted in some of the</i>
<i>wildest weather we've ever seen.</i>

176
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:58,587
<i>Yes, this is thunder snow in Dallas, Texas.</i>

177
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:00,534
<i>Visibility is near zero...</i>

178
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,458
<i>and there's more snow expected tonight</i>

179
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:05,693
<i>than Dallas usually sees</i>
<i>in an entire year.</i>

180
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:08,628
<i>It's only one part of</i>
<i>a worldwide weather phenomenon</i>

181
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,265
<i>unlike anything</i>
<i>we've ever seen before.</i>

182
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,466
Arthur.

183
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:24,345
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

184
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:27,748
There's been
another plague outbreak.

185
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:31,152
<i>Scientists are</i>
<i>at a loss to explain.</i>

186
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:33,187
<i>But the real question is,</i>

187
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:34,688
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

188
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,459
<i>And how much hotter</i>
<i>is it going to get?</i>

189
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,464
Where did it hit this time?

190
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,597
The Ninth Tride
of Atlantis,

191
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,432
and there are now reports
of outbreaks

192
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,702
in the Fishermen Kingdom
as well.

193
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,739
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

194
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:52,863
Why now?

195
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:56,112
Increased ocean acidity,
decreased oxygen levels,

196
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,543
toxic algal blooms.

197
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,184
Take your pick.

198
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:03,742
The surface has been poisoning our
atmosphere for over a century.

199
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,877
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

200
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,117
if they don't even know
we exist.

201
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,073
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

202
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,702
we have to take our seat
at the table.

203
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:21,307
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself
to the surface.

204
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:28,970
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

205
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,730
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

206
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:34,746
and combine our technologies to reverse
the damage that they've already done.

207
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,548
And I know this is
against our traditions,

208
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,082
but the world is shrinking,

209
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,655
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

210
00:19:42,896 --> 00:19:44,328
Times have changed.

211
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,626
Atlantis wants this.

212
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:48,161
There's a whole generation
out there

213
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,596
that don't want
to hide anymore.

214
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:53,070
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

215
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,064
killed your own beloved mentor,

216
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:59,305
and you want to negotiate
with them?

217
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:04,374
We gave your brother war powers and
made him Ocean Master for a reason.

218
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,683
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface-dwellers,

219
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:12,950
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

220
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,453
Hey, not bad.

221
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,787
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

222
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:49,683
I don't know
how you did it, Pops.

223
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,793
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

224
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:54,292
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

225
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,730
And you...

226
00:20:56,866 --> 00:21:00,371
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

227
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,674
You're the real superhero.

228
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:11,811
To single parents.
Mmm.

229
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,915
Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

230
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,525
Yeah, well,
I just plain suck at my job.

231
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,025
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

232
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:28,631
The problem is half of Atlantis still
wants to destroy the surface.

233
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,134
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

234
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,231
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

235
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,802
I know.

236
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,443
I miss him.

237
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:43,612
Hey.

238
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,113
You can't save them all, son.

239
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:52,390
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

240
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:56,394
I just kept going.

241
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:59,662
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

242
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:02,328
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

243
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,433
Sometimes not giving up

244
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:07,097
is the most heroic thing
you can do.

245
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,374
<i>Because you'll be there tomorrow morning...</i>

246
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,538
<i>and you're comrades will be there.</i>

247
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,664
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

248
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,666
Yeah, don't worry about that.

249
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:14,539
You just remember
who built this ship.

250
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:17,138
I'm more worried about
how long ago they built it.

251
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:21,974
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

252
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,059
Hey, doc.

253
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,864
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

254
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,173
Expedition log, day 613.

255
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,881
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

256
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:03,015
<i>A three man octobot infiltration team.</i>

257
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,459
<i>It's incredible</i>
<i>that these ancient machine we found</i>

258
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,616
<i>still function after all these years.</i>

259
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:11,656
<i>All I did was retrofit them to our needs.</i>

260
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:16,200
<i>But they require a very specialized fuel</i>
<i>to keep them running.</i>

261
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:18,228
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

262
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:20,100
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>he knows about this,</i>

263
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,874
<i>but it all started the day</i>
<i>he found that trident.</i>

264
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,875
<i>Suddenly, he knows secrets</i>
<i>that he couldn't possibly know,</i>

265
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,605
<i>including the only way</i>
<i>to obtain this orichalcum</i>

266
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,883
<i>is to steal it from highly-protected</i>
<i>storage vaults.</i>

267
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:34,981
<i>And we're about to hit the most</i>
<i>dangerous one of them all.</i>

268
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:23,634
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

269
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,670
<i>No margin for error.</i>

270
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,950
<i>Yeah, this should take you through.</i>

271
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:58,164
<i>We don't want any confrontation.</i>

272
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,100
<i>David, we can't fight their entire army.</i>

273
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,554
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

274
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:22,369
<i>We have no idea what kind of</i>
<i>security measures they have down there.</i>

275
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:50,382
<i>Commencing extraction.</i>

276
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,251
<i>Be careful.</i>
<i>It's highly volatile.</i>

277
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,733
<i>Loading barge now.</i>

278
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,518
Stingray, change of plans.

279
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:25,118
I need an extraction now!

280
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:28,852
All hands to battle stations.

281
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:34,251
<i>Go on!..</i>
<i>Everyone to there posts we are in combat.</i>

282
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:03,827
Astounding.

283
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:10,293
Attention,
unidentified vessel.

284
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:11,899
You are out
of the transit zone.

285
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:14,337
Doctor, power up
the sonic battery.

286
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:17,669
Illegal border crossing
will be met with deadly force.

287
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:18,804
Now!

288
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:22,780
Commencing charge.

289
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:31,654
Border Control,
intruder approaching.

290
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,719
Arm hydro cannon
and lock target.

291
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,320
Hydro cannon at front border gate
locking in on target.

292
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,191
Chargers set
to maximum power.

293
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,599
Intruder in sight.

294
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:44,164
Take them out!

295
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:51,842
What are you waiting for?
Fire!

296
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:25,439
Sir, Atlantean hostiles
are approaching.

297
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,815
Split up.
Make your way to the extraction point.

298
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,077
Roger.

299
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:30,812
They've raided
the storage vault.

300
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:31,979
We can't let them get away.

301
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:35,149
Don't worry, they won't.
I'm on this one.

302
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:50,460
Hold your fire!

303
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:52,426
They're cutting
through the Night Market.

304
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:54,498
Watch out for the civilians.

305
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:50,650
Warning. Warning.

306
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,455
Illegal entrance
into hypertube.

307
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:55,422
Exceeding maximum speed
of 600 knots.

308
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,401
Reduce speed immediately.

309
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,615
Oh, shit.

310
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,370
<i>David, we're here</i>
<i>at the extraction point.</i>

311
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:05,799
<i>The orichalcum is on board and secure.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

312
00:32:05,935 --> 00:32:07,035
Not yet!

313
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,007
I'm gonna kill me
a dead mermaid.

314
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,416
Get away from my wife!

315
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:26,318
Your wife?

316
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:28,790
First you steal
your brother's throne,

317
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:30,726
then you steal his woman?

318
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:34,187
Aquaman, shame on you.

319
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,403
Uh, David, we gotta go.

320
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:44,567
The entire Atlantean army
is headed this way.

321
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:47,044
If we don't leave now,
we're dead.

322
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,489
Twenty degrees port!

323
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,375
Fire the sonic cannon!

324
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,245
Come on, Shin!

325
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,327
<i>Lady Karshon has called</i>

326
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:13,490
<i>an emergency session of the High Council</i>

327
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:17,026
<i>to discuss a motion that would strip</i>
<i>the throne of its executive power.</i>

328
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:21,762
<i>The throne</i>
<i>is the heart of Atlantis.</i>

329
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:24,264
<i>Too often now it stands empty,</i>

330
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,810
<i>while our king spends half</i>
<i>his time on land.</i>

331
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:32,510
<i>And now his surface world enemies</i>
<i>have followed him home.</i>

332
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:35,317
<i>This tragedy is merely a taste</i>

333
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,617
<i>of the havoc that will be wrought,</i>

334
00:34:37,753 --> 00:34:41,424
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes known</i>
<i>to the surface.</i>

335
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,095
<i>Because if he cannot protect</i>
<i>his own family,</i>

336
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,528
<i>how is he supposed to protect us?</i>

337
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,802
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

338
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:00,838
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

339
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,308
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

340
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:04,708
The technology seems ancient,

341
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:06,977
but we've never seen
anything like it.

342
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:11,186
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

343
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,021
that disrupts
the nervous system.

344
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,455
Do we know what was stolen?

345
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:18,855
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

346
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:21,959
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

347
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:25,434
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

348
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:28,171
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

349
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:29,945
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

350
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,736
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

351
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:35,511
before we realized
what we were doing.

352
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,010
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

353
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:42,716
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

354
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,727
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

355
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,422
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

356
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:49,386
We think he's been
launching secret raids

357
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,292
for at least five months.

358
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:52,828
This is just the time
he got caught.

359
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,427
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

360
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:56,259
that's causing disasters
on the surface

361
00:35:56,395 --> 00:36:01,131
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

362
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:04,769
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

363
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,624
Why would he do that?

364
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,639
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

365
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,101
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

366
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,322
we don't have much time.

367
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,264
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

368
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:20,888
He must be stopped or a
global climate meltdown is imminent.

369
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:21,852
We need to find him,

370
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,898
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

371
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:26,522
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

372
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,166
But you're not gonna like it.

373
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,098
Your brother?

374
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,514
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

375
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,265
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past,

376
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,684
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

377
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:42,373
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

378
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:44,512
He killed their king.

379
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:46,879
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

380
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:51,448
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

381
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,950
It would be an act of war.

382
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,986
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

383
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,861
I'm gonna break him out myself.

384
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:03,556
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

385
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:06,369
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

386
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,876
My place is out there
where I belong,

387
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,340
where I'm actually good
at what I do.

388
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,704
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

389
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,904
I've got to do this.

390
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:18,775
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

391
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:21,351
it will tear
the kingdoms apart.

392
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:25,554
Then help me not get caught.

393
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,801
<i>Xebelian intelligence</i>
<i>has recently learned</i>

394
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,794

395

398
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:43,065
And here's a special outfit
for you.

399
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,305
What is that,
boy's extra medium?

400
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:47,606
It's supposed to be tight.

401
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:49,072
The chromatophores
change color

402
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,727
<i>and camouflage you for up to a minute,</i>

403
00:37:50,846 --> 00:37:53,446
<i>making you undetectable to most sensors.</i>

404
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:55,682
<i>They'll never see you coming.</i>

405
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,265
What are we doing for comms?

406
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:00,988
Open comms are too risky.

407
00:38:01,123 --> 00:38:04,592
I'll be sending a cephalopod with you
to act as a messenger.

408
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:07,562
That's an octopus.

Topo, for short.

Genetically
engineered intelligence

412

413
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,542
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

414
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:28,385
Just try and lay low
when we get in there, okay?

415
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,280
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

416
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,419
is starting to smell like
warm chum butter.

417
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,287
Aw, Topo, you dumb squid!

418
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:37,988
God, come on!

419
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,491
Is ink piss?

420
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:44,298
<i>The prison is guarded</i>
<i>by fearsome Deserter remnants.</i>

<i>he'll be weak.</i>

426
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:59,679
<i>They're limiting his water supply...</i>

427
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:02,419
<i>just enough to keep him alive.</i>

428
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:07,717
And if you do see Orm,

429
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:09,525
you tell him that I love him.

430
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,090
You tell him
that I think of him every day.

431
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:15,694
I will.

432
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,226
Look,
I know he's family,

433
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:19,762
but you can't forget
who you're dealing with here.

434
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,571
Once you've broken Orm out,

435
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,211
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

<i>You need him,</i>

What the hell

439
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,006
I'm here to break you out.

440
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:36,974
Have you lost your mind?

441
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,547
You're the one who put me here.

442
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,078
Eh, why you
bringing up old shit?

443
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:43,019
We'll talk about it later.

444
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:44,917
You cannot break me out.

445
00:40:45,053 --> 00:40:47,251
There's a treaty
with the Fishermen Kingdom.

446
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:49,921
Look, I gotta stop David Kane

Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

Come on. Let's go.

452

This changes nothing.

453
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,819
Wouldn't have it any other way,
little brother.

454
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:21,987

Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

457
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,263
Wake up and open the door.

Topo!

462
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,694
All right, come on.

463
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,802
Wait.

464
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:12,436
Did you... bring water?

465
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,571
Yeah.

466
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,411
Uh, no, sorry.

467
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,207
I drank it all
on the way here.

468
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:20,584
What?
Bro, it's hot up there.

469
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:44,537
Whoa! Easy.

470
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:47,842
Whoa!

471
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:53,280
You know how
to ride one of these?

472
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:54,540
Are you kidding?

473
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:55,988
I don't even know
what the hell it is.

474
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:57,148
Hyaah!
What?

475
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:04,122
Yeah!

476
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:15,265
Yeah!

477
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,741
Whoa.

478
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:37,694
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

479
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,925
All right,
the water's right there.

480
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,394
Let's go, skinny jeans.

481
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:11,110
Yeah. All right.

482
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:13,038
Good job, little brother.
High-five.

483
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:14,541
No.

484
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:16,886
All right.
Good job.

485
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,154
You know, I got a bunch
of king shit to do back in Atlantis

486
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,899
so we should go.

487
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:32,836
Ahh! Come on, Topo!

488
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,653
This is worse than
I could have possibly imagined.

489
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,362
The safety and security
of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

490
00:47:01,497 --> 00:47:04,098
No king has allowed the great city wall
to be breached

491
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:06,602
in a hundred generations.

492
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:08,366
A hundred generations? Really?

493
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,400
How many years is that?
I'm bad with geology.

494
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:13,008
What is that, like,
a million years?

495
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:15,945
Oh? You're calling me
one in a million?

496
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,980
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

497
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:21,082
It's undignified for a king
to jest.

498
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,348
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness,
if I use comedy

499
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:25,954
to mask my feelings
and deal with stress.

500
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,524
Otherwise,
I'd end up looking like you.

501
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:29,585
A very tight butthole.

502
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,252
Super tight.

503
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:36,861
You know, if the pressures of leadership
are too stressful,

504
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:38,563
perhaps you should leave

505
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:41,366
and let someone who knows
what they're doing be king.

506
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:44,967
You know what?

507
00:47:45,102 --> 00:47:47,822
I cannot wait to throw your ass
back in prison when this is all over.

508
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,841
You won't have to.

509
00:47:49,976 --> 00:47:52,056
Once I stop David Kane,
I'll surrender myself to the Fishermen.

510
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,379
That is my honor to Atlantis.

511
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:56,809
You're so dramatic.

512
00:47:56,945 --> 00:47:59,121
Whatever.
Just help me find this asshole.

513
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:01,991
Well, my contact will at least
know where to look.

514
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,522
What happened to him?

515
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:09,499
David Kane that I knew was
ruthless,

516
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,524
but he wasn't insane.

517
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:15,004
<i>This guy just put a gun to the world's head</i>
<i>and pulled the trigger.</i>

518
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:17,303
<i>Without even making any demands.</i>

519
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:22,701
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

520
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:25,206
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

521
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:27,634
Well, you found it.

522
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:30,874
All I did was figure out
how it worked.

523
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,376
I didn't think we'd ever actually have
to use it on anyone.

524
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:36,985
Yeah, well, what can I say?

525
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,919
Things don't always
go as planned.

526
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:40,518
But that's what I'm afraid of.

527
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:47,063
David, this stuff could reshape
the entire planet.

528
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:51,034
Hey, doc.

529
00:49:53,595 --> 00:50:00,671
We are this close to unlocking the
greatest power in human history.

530
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:04,212
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

531
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:10,086
If I said yes,
would you let me?

532
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:13,452
Sure.

533
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:17,676
You want to see how
long you last in that jungle?

534
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:20,829
Be my guest.

535
00:50:34,174 --> 00:50:35,606
Yeah, I'll stick around.

536
00:50:38,648 --> 00:50:39,841
Yeah.

537
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:57,030
<i>Welcome to the last frontier.</i>

538
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:01,203
<i>They scavenged ships from around the world</i>
<i>to build this place.</i>

539
00:51:02,203 --> 00:51:03,634
<i>The Sunken Citadel.</i>

540
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,340
<i>It is the one place in the world</i>

541
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,111
<i>where the scum of the land</i>
<i>and sea mingle.</i>

542
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:11,273
<i>It is where people come to disappear.</i>

543
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:12,577
<i>Wow.</i>

544
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:16,383
It's an impressive shithole.

545
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:18,515
How have I never
heard of this place before?

546
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:21,217
It is not meant
to be common knowledge.

547
00:51:21,353 --> 00:51:22,554
It's a pirate haven.

548
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:24,627
Pirates?

549
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:27,669
Listen, I don't know
if you know this about me,

550
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,995
but I'm not too popular
with pirates.

551
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:41,177
Oh, I'm well aware.

552
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:50,652
Relax. It was the only way
to get us both in.

553
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:55,525
You could've at least
given me a heads up.

554
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,993
Would you have
gone along with it?

555
00:51:57,128 --> 00:51:59,123
Hell, no.
Then put a hook in it.

556
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,495
There. That's Kingfish.

557
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,535
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

558
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,458
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

559
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,166
Cool.

560
00:52:41,302 --> 00:52:42,342
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

561
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:45,074
Just let me handle this.

562
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,740
He's our best shot
at finding Manta,

563
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,208
and he's not going to tell us
anything if you go in there

564
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:51,280
flexing your muscles at him.

565
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:56,318
You're so lucky we didn't grow
up together, little brother.

566
00:52:57,483 --> 00:53:00,118
Do not call me "brother."

567
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:01,454
Well...

568
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,725
This is a bit of a surprise,
isn't it?

569
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:09,129
I didn't realize you'd been released
from prison.

570
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:12,196
It is a recent development.

571
00:53:12,332 --> 00:53:16,338
Outlaws, aren't we all?

572
00:53:17,272 --> 00:53:19,468
We need to find David Kane.

573
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:22,441
Bad news, I'm afraid.

574
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:26,145
David Kane is no longer
on the market.

575
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:28,978
Not for sale at any price.

576
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:33,845
He's solely running
as an independent operator.

577
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,984
Where is he holed up now?

578
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:41,957
In exchange, I offer a favor...

579
00:53:43,034 --> 00:53:46,533
from the King of Atlantis.

580
00:53:48,297 --> 00:53:50,403
You seriously expect me
to play footsie with someone

581
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:52,368
with that kind of blood
on their hands?

582
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:54,972
I don't have hands!

583
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,372
Or feet!

584
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,482
Um...

585
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:05,983
Listen, if the information
checks out good,

586
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,320
I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

587
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:10,986
and tear this place apart.

588
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:15,527
That's too bad.

589
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,695
Traditionally,
the kings of Atlantis

590
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:22,368
have turned a blind eye
to the Sunken Citadel.

591
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:26,507
Now, we have to blind it
for you.

592
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,950
Fine. Flex your muscles.

593
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,960
Smash his stupid head in!

594
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,336
Boom!

595
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:10,419
Gotcha, fatback!

596
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:16,758
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

597
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:18,187
Talk.

598
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:20,759
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

599
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:23,394
A dormant volcano
in the South Pacific,

600
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,368
called "Devil's Deep."

601
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:27,102
Talk faster.

602
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,570
It's been barren for years.

603
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:30,730
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

604
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:33,542
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start to get close.

605
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,544
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

606
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:39,579
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

607
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,982
I'd say that's where Kane
is hiding out.

608
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:47,390
We got all we needed. Let's go!

609
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:02,735
<i>♪ Rise up, come ♪</i>
<i>♪ Rise up through the fire ♪</i>

610
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:11,145
Soon you'll be
more powerful than he is.

611
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,271
But you're not ready yet,

612
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:16,151
and you involved him
far too soon.

613
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:18,780
I sense them closing in on us.

614
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:20,588
Do I seem concerned?

615
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:22,390
Hmm?

616
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:25,418
If anything,
it's even easier now.

617
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:27,925
We couldn't have planned it
any better than...

618
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,005
Oh. Oh.

619
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,873
Hey.

620
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:40,835
Uh, I... I just wanted to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

621
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:42,940
is now running at peak output.

622
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:36,829
I win.

623
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:44,672
Topo, go back to Atlantis
and give them our coordinates.

624
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,256
You know
what'd be amazing right now?

625
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:55,783
Reinforcements?

626
00:57:55,918 --> 00:57:58,119
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

627
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:01,786
You gotta admit, the food
is so much better up here.

628
00:58:01,919 --> 00:58:03,352
I find that hard to believe.

629
00:58:03,488 --> 00:58:05,189
Hold up.

630
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:06,903
You telling me you never went topside
to have a cheeseburger?

631
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:10,289
What?
Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

632
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:12,765
Or a thick, juicy,
medium raw steak

633
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,500
with fries and a shake,
and you dip it...

634
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:17,369
Even the words that surface-dwellers
give their food

635
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:20,306
sound disgusting.

636
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:23,668
You've let your prejudices stop you
from enjoying half the world.

637
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:27,176
You should think about that.
It's your loss, dude.

638
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:36,985
Aw, yeah!

639
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,351
Bet you never had one of these.

640
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:42,158
What is it?
It's a cockroach.

641
00:58:42,293 --> 00:58:45,260
You eat it?
Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

642
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:02,812
Mmm. Mmm.
Eh?

643
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:04,851
That's good. Here, drink this.

644
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,186
Okay, you first.

645
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:45,056
Are you seeing this?

646
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:49,225
That's not normal?

647
00:59:53,932 --> 00:59:56,298
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

648
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:00,203
Let's get out of here.

649
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:02,275
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

650
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,709
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time,

651
01:00:05,845 --> 01:00:08,280
turning them... monstrous.

652
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:09,415
Whoa.

653
01:00:18,723 --> 01:00:19,959
Oh, shit...

654
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,174
Run!

655
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:37,003
Come on.

656
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:40,683
Faster!

657
01:00:47,183 --> 01:00:48,887
What the hell are you doing?

658
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,555
I don't know.
I'm not used to running.

659
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,991
Just do what I do.

660
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:53,807
Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

661
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,330
Like this?

662
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:58,530
Holy shit.
Yeah!

663
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,131
Wait up.
Yeah!

664
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:28,229
Whoa!

665
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,141
We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

666
01:01:34,165 --> 01:01:35,763
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

667
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:38,939
What do you wanna do, stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

668
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,744
What is that?
What does that say?

669
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,479
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

670
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,749
"A true king builds bridges."

671
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:52,550
What are you doing?

672
01:01:57,355 --> 01:01:59,354
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

673
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,552
See?
A true king builds bridges.

674
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:34,355
That's a metaphor!

675
01:02:34,491 --> 01:02:36,694
Hey!
I forgot to tell you.

676
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,029
Mom says she loves you.

677
01:02:38,165 --> 01:02:40,166
She thinks about you
all the time.

678
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:42,529
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

679
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:43,680
I don't know.

680
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,580
I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

681
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:53,145
Come on.

682
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:23,373
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

683
01:03:33,253 --> 01:03:34,746
Uh, David?
I just ran more tests,

684
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:36,319
and this data
is really disturbing.

685
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:39,862
We have to stop
burning the... orichalcum.

686
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,162
David?

687
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:50,037
Oh.

688
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:57,368
Okay, doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

689
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,375
Here it is.

690
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:05,312
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and
destroy everything he holds dear.

691
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:10,953
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

692
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:16,147
I will avenge my father.

693
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:19,489
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

694
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,394
David, you can't trust
the trident.

695
01:05:28,305 --> 01:05:33,837
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

696
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,476
Pray I never show it
to you again.

697
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:06,297
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

698
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,716
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

699
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,677
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

700
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:13,457
Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking for your advice on this.

701
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:15,361
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

702
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,818
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

703
01:06:17,953 --> 01:06:19,553
So, what's your plan?

704
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,567
I don't have one, yet.
But he came after my wife,

705
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,953
which means I'm gonna pull his tongue
out of his butt.

706
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:26,726
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

707
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:29,687
This coming from the guy who
turned the entire nation of Atlantis

708
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,431
into his own private ego trip?

709
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,693
My ego?

710
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,377
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

711
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:35,921
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

712
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,877
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

713
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:40,970
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

714
01:06:41,106 --> 01:06:42,577
Unbelievable.

715
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:43,871
Wait, wait! Wait!

716
01:06:44,006 --> 01:06:46,014
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

717
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:48,573
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

718
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:51,589
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

719
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:53,317
And I might even be
screwing that up.

720
01:06:53,452 --> 01:06:54,772
You really
had no ambition for it?

721
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:56,324
Absolutely not.

722
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,391
From the day my father found out
you existed,

723
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:00,303
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

724
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:01,629
and challenge me
for the throne.

725
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:03,155
Wow, that's really sad.

726
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:04,639
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

727
01:07:04,663 --> 01:07:07,064
with basically no prep time
whatsoever.

728
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,232
Roasted.

729
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:10,800
That is not how it happened.

730
01:07:10,936 --> 01:07:12,747
That's exactly how it happened.
Mera saved you.

731
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,609
No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

732
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:16,684
Nope. She made
the little water tornado. I fell in it.

733
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,468
Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

734
01:07:26,855 --> 01:07:28,383
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

735
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:29,881
Come on, let's do this.

736
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:31,369
Once this is over with,

737
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:32,766
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

738
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,470
Don't push it.
Tacos and tequila.

739
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,428
I don't even
know those words.

740
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:48,940
Huh?
Shh!

741
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:04,527
Hey!

742
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:40,162
Whoa, brother.

743
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:44,391
<i>Sleep Tight!</i>

744
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:52,306
It's an orichalcum furnace.

745
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:54,909
All that stolen orichalcum.

746
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:56,509
They're just burning it up.

747
01:08:56,644 --> 01:08:58,946
He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

748
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:00,547
This is catastrophic.

749
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:03,074
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

750
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,383
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

751
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:07,019
Question is,
how do we stop 'em?

752
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:08,420
To take out this reactor,

753
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:10,196
we would have to crater
the entire island.

754
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,827
Get away from there! Now!

755
01:09:13,962 --> 01:09:18,530
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

756
01:09:24,671 --> 01:09:26,741
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

757
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:29,706
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

758
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,577
Please take me with you.

759
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:36,477
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

760
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,776
No, no. Wait, please.

761
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:40,379
I didn't want any of this.

762
01:09:40,514 --> 01:09:43,490
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

763
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,626
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

764
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:49,757
I'm a scientist,
and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

765
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,328
David Kane said
he could help me,

766
01:09:51,464 --> 01:09:52,996
but now he won't let me leave.

767
01:09:53,131 --> 01:09:56,469
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

768
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,667
I know.

769
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:00,802
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

770
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:03,437
But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

771
01:10:03,573 --> 01:10:05,808
Knock him out.

772
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,248
No.

773
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,384
Then I'll knock him out.
No!

774
01:10:11,349 --> 01:10:12,984
What?
No.

775
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:15,686
Fine!

776
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:17,791
You can come with us.

777
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:19,553
Oh... thank you.

778
01:10:19,688 --> 01:10:22,697
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one <i>sasa!</i>

779
01:10:22,769 --> 01:10:24,106
<i>Sleep!...Okay..Okay.</i>

780
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:25,366
It's the black trident.

781
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,532
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

782
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,348
It gives Kane great powers
and in return...

783
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,152
I hate when that happens.

784
01:11:02,168 --> 01:11:03,399
Stop them!

785
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:06,764
<i>You and you take him away.</i>

786
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:08,091
Whoa!

787
01:13:08,227 --> 01:13:09,697
Ow!

788
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,466
Ow!

789
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:19,370
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the orichalcum!

790
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:20,571
You wanna blow us up?

791
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:22,404
This stuff blows up?
Yes!

792
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:25,106
My bad!

793
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:29,307
Then stop using it!

794
01:13:29,443 --> 01:13:31,453
Just shut up
and let me save your ass.

795
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,020
Again.

796
01:14:56,068 --> 01:14:58,668
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

797
01:14:58,804 --> 01:15:00,102
I told you he's stronger now.

798
01:15:00,237 --> 01:15:03,809
He's still just a surface-dweller.

799
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,116
Bro!
Bah!

800
01:15:18,459 --> 01:15:22,390
I never expected to see
you two fighting side by side.

801
01:15:22,526 --> 01:15:25,160
We're making a special exception
just for you.

802
01:15:30,506 --> 01:15:32,667
No one hits my brother but me.

803
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:37,474
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

804
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:39,207
You're making this easy.

805
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,956
Yeah!

806
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:56,664
Come at me,
the killer of kings.

807
01:16:56,887 --> 01:16:58,792
Take that island down!

808
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:23,245
Fire at will!

809
01:17:34,894 --> 01:17:36,698
We've got to get out of here.

810
01:17:46,976 --> 01:17:48,683
Malfunction.
Malfunction.

811
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:50,173
Warning. Warning.

812
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:17,838
Shin, let's go!

813
01:18:22,842 --> 01:18:24,344
What are you waiting for?

814
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,308
Fire the goddamn cannon!

815
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:31,774
I'm sorry
to drag you all into this.

816
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:34,293
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

817
01:19:34,446 --> 01:19:37,116
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel.

818
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,698
I do.

819
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:38,847
And the Brine Kingdom

820
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:40,917
has not forgotten
its debt to you.

821
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:43,380
You may count on us always.

822
01:19:43,516 --> 01:19:45,319
Something happened to me.

823
01:19:45,873 --> 01:19:48,285
When I touched
that black trident.

824
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:50,292
Why is he even here?

825
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:52,496
He should be
on his way back to prison.

826
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,193
We should hear
what he has to say.

827
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,878
I made that mistake once.

828
01:19:56,185 --> 01:19:58,031
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

829
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:01,304
And he cut off my claw.

830
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:03,977
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

831
01:20:04,112 --> 01:20:06,578
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

832
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,181
And just for the record,

833
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:10,610
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

834
01:20:12,852 --> 01:20:14,350
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

835
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:20,725
Mom, I don't know enough
about this.

836
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,561
Is that even possible?

837
01:20:22,696 --> 01:20:25,724
All anyone knows for sure is there once
was a seventh kingdom

838
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,598
and then one day,
just before the fall,

839
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:31,698
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

840
01:20:31,834 --> 01:20:34,470
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

841
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,708
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

842
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:39,408
It's called Necrus.

843
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:42,114
And I didn't just see it.

844
01:20:43,419 --> 01:20:44,419
I knew it.

845
01:20:45,648 --> 01:20:49,352
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

846
01:20:50,586 --> 01:20:54,225
Flashes
of someone else's memories.

847
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:56,526
During King Atlan's time,

848
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:01,001
there were seven united kingdoms
of Atlantis.

849
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:05,203
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

850
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,477
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

851
01:21:13,612 --> 01:21:16,916
<i>Necrus rapidly became</i>
<i>a superpower unlike any other.</i>

852
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,818
But it came
at a terrible price.

853
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:21,848
<i>Poisoning the land, the sea,</i>

854
01:21:21,984 --> 01:21:25,223
<i>even the mind of the tyrant</i>
<i>who ruled Necrus.</i>

855
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,628
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

856
01:21:30,763 --> 01:21:32,638
<i>Atlan pleaded with him</i>

857
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:34,859
<i>to stop using it before the world</i>

858
01:21:34,994 --> 01:21:36,529
<i>was irrevocably damaged.</i>

859
01:21:36,665 --> 01:21:39,273
<i>However, Kordax resented Atlan,</i>

860
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:41,972
<i>thinking his own brother</i>
<i>was trying to steal his power.</i>

861
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:47,680
<i>So, he resorted to dark magic</i>
<i>and crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

862
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:49,240
<i>That black trident.</i>

863
01:21:59,023 --> 01:22:01,990
<i>He transformed his people</i>
<i>and himself into monsters...</i>

864
01:22:06,164 --> 01:22:08,132
to fight Atlantis.

865
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:10,169
So, the two brothers
went to war.

866
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:21,081
<i>But Atlan defeated Kordax</i>

867
01:22:21,217 --> 01:22:24,118
<i>and imprisoned him and all of Necrus</i>

868
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:27,080
<i>with a spell cast with his own blood...</i>

869
01:22:30,809 --> 01:22:33,335
<i>to ensure that</i>
<i>Kordax's dark power</i>

870
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,359
<i>would never be found.</i>

871
01:22:35,555 --> 01:22:38,461
<i>And that is why Necrus is stricken</i>
<i>from the chronicles.</i>

872
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:53,047
This evil was supposed to
remain frozen for eternity.

873
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,150
But David Kane has found it.

874
01:22:58,744 --> 01:23:01,417
<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

875
01:23:01,553 --> 01:23:03,251
But even with the ice cap melting,

876
01:23:03,386 --> 01:23:05,324
Kordax still can't be freed.

877
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:08,028
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

878
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:09,996
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

879
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:11,698
Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

880
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:15,002
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

881
01:23:15,138 --> 01:23:16,864
Blood magic isn't really magic,
it's DNA.

882
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,265
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

883
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:26,080
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

884
01:23:28,247 --> 01:23:29,578
We're the end of the bloodline.

885
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:35,956
No, we're not.

886
01:23:36,092 --> 01:23:38,732
<i>Wildfires would have</i>
<i>made headlines across the world,</i>

887
01:23:38,756 --> 01:23:40,959
<i>but now, they're almost</i>
<i>a weekly occurrence.</i>

888
01:23:41,095 --> 01:23:44,262
<i>We're witnessing unprecedented</i>
<i>weather events across the globe,</i>

889
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:45,760
<i>and meteorologists are at a loss</i>

890
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,662
<i>to explain this rapid change</i>
<i>in climate.</i>

891
01:23:47,797 --> 01:23:49,533
<i>From sweltering heatwaves and droughts,</i>

892
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:51,567
<i>which are shattering temperature records,</i>

893
01:23:51,703 --> 01:23:53,273
<i>to torrential rains and floodings...</i>

894
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,248
What is going on?
<i>Hurricane bearing down</i>

895
01:23:55,372 --> 01:23:58,244
<i>on the East Coast,</i>
<i>leaving one million homes without power...</i>

896
01:24:00,377 --> 01:24:03,148
Make that a million and one.

897
01:24:03,283 --> 01:24:05,278
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

898
01:24:22,902 --> 01:24:26,538
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

899
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:36,244
Dad!

900
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,251
Tom!
Dad!

901
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:40,484
Tom!

902
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:43,053
No! Dad!

903
01:24:43,188 --> 01:24:44,488
Where's Junior?

904
01:24:47,786 --> 01:24:49,563
No!

905
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,092
I'm sorry, son.

906
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:52,997
Where's Junior?

907
01:24:53,132 --> 01:24:56,637
Manta... took Junior.

908
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:58,601
No!
No!

909
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:01,175
No!

910
01:25:56,597 --> 01:25:58,764
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

911
01:25:58,899 --> 01:26:00,299
He will be okay.

912
01:26:00,434 --> 01:26:01,998
We just picked up a signal.

913
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:03,736
It's faint,

914
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:06,433
but it's broadcasting on an old Atlantean
sonar frequency.

915
01:26:06,568 --> 01:26:08,506
Headed to Antarctica.

916
01:26:09,575 --> 01:26:11,971
Bring our little one back.
I will.

917
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:15,844
I've dreamed of this.

918
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:18,780
The two of you standing together
as brothers.

919
01:26:22,556 --> 01:26:24,786
Promise me
you will protect each other.

920
01:26:28,093 --> 01:26:29,956
Promise me, Orm.

921
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:44,938
Go.

922
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,672
Great waves, Nereus.

923
01:27:13,808 --> 01:27:18,074
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

924
01:27:18,209 --> 01:27:22,979
I say we ditch all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

925
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,579
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

926
01:27:25,715 --> 01:27:27,521
Our only chance is to hit him

927
01:27:27,656 --> 01:27:30,256
with total overwhelming force
from every direction.

928
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:32,254
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

929
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,590
What choice do we have?

930
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:35,389
We have no defense
against that cannon.

931
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:36,757
Well, wait a minute.

932
01:27:36,893 --> 01:27:38,562
So this cannon
sends out sound waves

933
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:40,662
that messes with
our nervous system, right?

934
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:43,665
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

935
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,328
Well, what if
we disrupt those echoes

936
01:27:45,464 --> 01:27:47,264
with another sound wave
on the same frequency,

937
01:27:47,373 --> 01:27:49,375
but just much, much louder?

938
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:51,871
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

939
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:53,710
Well, that's
gonna be the easy part.

940
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:56,812
Take your weapons.

941
01:27:58,218 --> 01:27:59,716
And ready your steeds.

942
01:28:08,854 --> 01:28:10,027
Hmm.

943
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:22,136
Really doesn't like you,
does he?

944
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,675
We made a lot of progress, doc.

945
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:58,109
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

946
01:28:58,245 --> 01:28:59,611
but we were damn close.

947
01:28:59,746 --> 01:29:02,416
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

948
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:07,388
My God, what did we do?

949
01:29:07,523 --> 01:29:09,952
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

950
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:12,755
All we did was fast forward things
a few years.

951
01:29:12,891 --> 01:29:14,505
The ice
hasn't fully melted yet,

952
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,661
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

953
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,563
Here.

954
01:29:18,699 --> 01:29:21,061
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

955
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:24,636
Power up the sonic cannon.

956
01:29:26,175 --> 01:29:27,639
Bag the child and suit up.

957
01:29:54,302 --> 01:29:57,198
Yah!

958
01:29:57,334 --> 01:29:59,836
Captain,
we have multiple incoming hostiles.

959
01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:02,872
You're too late.

960
01:30:12,547 --> 01:30:13,718
No.

961
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:41,179
Commence charge.

962
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:34,764
You've got to be kidding me.

963
01:32:10,798 --> 01:32:12,265
Astounding.

964
01:32:55,181 --> 01:32:57,411
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

965
01:32:57,547 --> 01:32:59,981
The throne of Necrus
is in the heart of the city.

966
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:01,598
I sense something
in the water.

967
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:02,902
Everyone, light it up.

968
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:12,461
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

969
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:14,334
Yes. I did.

970
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,230
Keep your eyes open.

971
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:19,267
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

972
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:22,368
Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

973
01:33:27,414 --> 01:33:29,643
Fire at will!

974
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,273
I think this goes
all the way through.

975
01:33:47,297 --> 01:33:50,403
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

976
01:33:50,538 --> 01:33:53,339
Go now and save the prince.

977
01:33:53,475 --> 01:33:54,972
Thank you, Your Highness.

978
01:33:57,073 --> 01:33:59,706
Come on, you spineless worms!

979
01:33:59,841 --> 01:34:01,275
Bring it on!

980
01:35:10,185 --> 01:35:11,279
Help me!

981
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:16,245
Give me the child.

982
01:37:10,328 --> 01:37:13,735
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, doc.

983
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,713
Get behind the portcullis!

984
01:37:19,848 --> 01:37:22,848
We need to close the gate!

985
01:37:59,918 --> 01:38:02,845
Get away from my son!

986
01:38:02,981 --> 01:38:06,157
Your blood
will do just fine.

987
01:38:07,894 --> 01:38:10,990
You want blood? Come get it!

988
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,476
Aquaman!

989
01:39:00,043 --> 01:39:01,608
Oh!

990
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:18,425
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident,

991
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:21,259
but you're only
half the man he was.

992
01:39:21,395 --> 01:39:24,131
How pathetic.

993
01:39:38,784 --> 01:39:39,849
Mera!

994
01:39:55,263 --> 01:39:56,531
Go!

995
01:40:11,018 --> 01:40:12,811
Mera...

996
01:40:13,983 --> 01:40:15,187
Run!

997
01:40:18,823 --> 01:40:20,888
Free me from my prison,

998
01:40:21,023 --> 01:40:26,796
and all my power will be yours
to wield as you desire.

999
01:41:02,396 --> 01:41:07,371
<i>Kill him,</i>
<i>and you will be Ocean Master again!</i>

1000
01:41:14,813 --> 01:41:17,607
Well,
now this is certainly an improvement.

1001
01:41:17,743 --> 01:41:20,286
Powerful, Atlantean body.

1002
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:23,616
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

1003
01:41:23,752 --> 01:41:25,234
It's not true.
Come on, little brother.

1004
01:41:25,258 --> 01:41:26,498
I know you're in there.

1005
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:29,052
Don't you see?
You can't win.

1006
01:41:29,187 --> 01:41:32,563
Either you kill your brother
or you die.

1007
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:52,145
By an Atlan's blood,
this magic is broken.

1008
01:42:05,464 --> 01:42:09,169
My eternal night is ending.

1009
01:42:15,936 --> 01:42:18,772
I'm done fighting your puppets,
Kordax.

1010
01:42:19,947 --> 01:42:22,215
I'm coming for you.

1011
01:42:25,086 --> 01:42:26,092
Give it to me!
No!

1012
01:42:26,116 --> 01:42:27,584
I can end this.

1013
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:31,422
Don't let him take it!
Hasn't he taken enough already?

1014
01:42:32,959 --> 01:42:34,126
Yield the throne.

1015
01:42:34,262 --> 01:42:37,561
It's time for me
to reclaim my destiny.

1016
01:42:37,697 --> 01:42:40,690
It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

1017
01:42:40,826 --> 01:42:42,428
I knew you would do this.

1018
01:42:42,564 --> 01:42:44,334
You are the one true king.

1019
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:47,937
Atlantis deserves
its one true king.

1020
01:42:50,307 --> 01:42:54,174
I am the one true king!

1021
01:43:01,653 --> 01:43:03,092
<i>You know, there was a time</i>

1022
01:43:03,116 --> 01:43:05,652
when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

1023
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:07,850
Let you know
that you weren't alone,

1024
01:43:07,985 --> 01:43:09,594
that we were in it together.

1025
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,825
<i>Promise me</i>
<i>you'll protect each other.</i>

1026
01:43:16,768 --> 01:43:20,438
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

1027
01:43:20,573 --> 01:43:23,736
I meant what I said
when I first met you.

1028
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:26,504
No matter what,
you are not alone.

1029
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,978
We're in this together.

1030
01:43:31,513 --> 01:43:32,978
You are my brother.

1031
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:39,660
Orm.

1032
01:43:42,664 --> 01:43:43,664
Let go.

1033
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,774
Orm, let it go.

1034
01:44:19,263 --> 01:44:22,227
I live again!

1035
01:44:22,363 --> 01:44:26,398
I have waited countless centuries
in the dark

1036
01:44:26,533 --> 01:44:28,440
for this moment.

1037
01:44:34,408 --> 01:44:35,777
Shit.

1038
01:44:43,318 --> 01:44:44,720
Arthur!

1039
01:44:49,584 --> 01:44:52,018
<i>Oh, I'll do I better this time.</i>

1040
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:12,478
Never.

1041
01:46:20,414 --> 01:46:23,522
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

1042
01:46:38,502 --> 01:46:39,769
Let's get outta here!

1043
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:53,876
Hurry!

1044
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:59,618
That's right!

1045
01:46:59,754 --> 01:47:01,560
Come on, baby! Yeah!

1046
01:47:17,476 --> 01:47:21,041
Yeah!

1047
01:47:38,966 --> 01:47:39,966
My love.

1048
01:47:41,701 --> 01:47:44,031
Hi, baby boy.

1049
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:54,646
Shin.

1050
01:47:55,247 --> 01:47:56,582
Thank you.

1051
01:48:03,057 --> 01:48:04,319
Astounding.

1052
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:12,591
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

1053
01:48:12,727 --> 01:48:13,727
Well, I'm not.

1054
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:16,033
My claw got cut off.

1055
01:48:16,168 --> 01:48:17,229
Again!

1056
01:48:19,138 --> 01:48:20,349
You're one tough crustacean,
Your Highness.

1057
01:48:20,373 --> 01:48:21,573
Bah!

1058
01:48:21,709 --> 01:48:24,137
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

1059
01:48:25,273 --> 01:48:27,547
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way though.

1060
01:48:32,053 --> 01:48:34,818
It's too bad you went and had
yourself killed back there.

1061
01:48:36,651 --> 01:48:37,651
Yes.

1062
01:48:37,752 --> 01:48:39,119
All this ice.

1063
01:48:40,595 --> 01:48:42,892
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

1064
01:48:44,522 --> 01:48:45,770
Just lay low for a while.

1065
01:48:45,794 --> 01:48:47,996
But don't go too far.

1066
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:49,933
I may need to call you up
for some advice.

1067
01:48:50,068 --> 01:48:53,166
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

1068
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:00,305
Thank you...

1069
01:49:01,976 --> 01:49:03,847
brother.

1070
01:49:18,766 --> 01:49:21,029
You're not as bad at this
as you think.

1071
01:49:22,496 --> 01:49:25,704
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1072
01:49:26,738 --> 01:49:28,503
You are everything I was not.

1073
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,809
You do the right thing when doing the wrong
thing is much easier.

1074
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:34,713
And you're willing
to ask for help

1075
01:49:35,647 --> 01:49:37,177
even from your worst enemy.

1076
01:49:39,046 --> 01:49:40,345
I know it may not feel like

1077
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,321
you know what you're
doing sometimes, but...

1078
01:49:42,457 --> 01:49:44,754
keep trusting your instincts.

1079
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:47,957
If you lead,
Atlantis will follow.

1080
01:49:51,096 --> 01:49:54,733
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

1081
01:49:55,802 --> 01:49:57,230
I thought that was just
a metaphor.

1082
01:50:00,065 --> 01:50:05,106
Well, your metaphor might have just saved
the world's ass.

1083
01:50:28,935 --> 01:50:30,455
<i>We've got breaking news.</i>

1084
01:50:30,571 --> 01:50:32,003
<i>We are witnessing history.</i>

1085
01:50:32,138 --> 01:50:34,306
<i>A moment the ramifications</i>
<i>of which simply...</i>

1086
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:35,442
<i>cannot be overstated.</i>

1087
01:50:38,412 --> 01:50:39,768
<i>A first contact...</i>

1088
01:50:39,903 --> 01:50:41,463
<i>with the undersea nation of Atlantis.</i>

1089
01:50:41,544 --> 01:50:43,584
<i>An entire civilization hidden</i>
<i>for thousands of years</i>

1090
01:50:43,649 --> 01:50:45,249
<i>about to be revealed.</i>

1091
01:50:51,716 --> 01:50:53,034
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>

1092
01:50:53,058 --> 01:50:54,364
<i>the world will never be the same.</i>

1093
01:50:54,388 --> 01:50:55,860
<i>The King of Atlantis</i>

1094
01:50:55,995 --> 01:50:57,435
<i>has reached out to the United Nations</i>

1095
01:50:57,459 --> 01:50:59,263
<i>and will be officially seeking membership.</i>

1096
01:50:59,398 --> 01:51:00,643
<i>And is expected</i>
<i>to propose a joint effort</i>

1097
01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:02,165
<i>to reverse the climate issues.</i>

1098
01:51:02,301 --> 01:51:04,104
<i>We are</i>
<i>told that this was the result</i>

1099
01:51:04,128 --> 01:51:06,398
<i>of weeks of secret negotiations</i>
<i>with the United Nations.</i>

1100
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:08,294
<i>We now go live</i>
<i>to Ellis Island,</i>

1101
01:51:08,373 --> 01:51:10,283
<i>where the first official</i>
<i>ambassador from Atlantis</i>

1102
01:51:10,307 --> 01:51:12,811
<i>is about to address the United Nations.</i>

1103
01:51:21,417 --> 01:51:24,917
I come here today as
a representative of two worlds.

1104
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:27,490
The land and the sea.

1105
01:51:31,056 --> 01:51:35,190
<i>And I stand here as proof</i>
<i>that change is coming to both.</i>

1106
01:51:35,326 --> 01:51:41,004
<i>And I'm calling for global unity</i>
<i>for a global crisis.</i>

1107
01:51:41,139 --> 01:51:43,105
<i>To finally bring harmony between us</i>

1108
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,208
<i>and the natural balance of our world.</i>

1109
01:51:46,343 --> 01:51:48,074

1113
