[Barry] <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,841
Photography was always my passion.

3
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,070
- I figured, why not make it my job?
- These are great.

4
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:11,763
Frost, you have always
been there for me.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,975
<i>It never occurred to me
that you might wanna live a life.</i>

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,435
Nice doing business with you.

7
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,481
This is a potential cure.
What's the bonding agent?

8
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,732
[Ramsey] <i>Dark matter.</i>

9
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:25,318
S.T.A.R. Labs has the dark matter
I need to take the next step.

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,695
<i>My cure will work.</i>

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,948
[Caitlin] <i>Or turn them into meta-humans
against their will.</i>

12
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,199
[screams]

13
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,992
You cannot avoid the coming Crisis.

14
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,323
Just tell me what I can do.

15
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,579
Flash must die.

16
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,004
I stared at that newspaper
for so many years.

17
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,175
[Cisco] "Flash missing.
Vanishes in Crisis."

18
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,486
[Barry] <i>At first, it felt like a guide.</i>

19
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,806
You know, like proof that things were...

20
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,850
headed in the right direction.

21
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,605
Then it became
a sword hanging over my head.

22
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,818
<i>A part of me always felt like...</i>

23
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,738
if I vanish...

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,323
in whatever Crisis is coming...

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,910
maybe I was still out there somewhere,

26
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,038
looking for a way to come back to you.

27
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,876
According to the Monitor,
that doesn't happen.

28
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,383
"To save the lives of billions,
the Flash must die."

29
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,135
- What kind of crap is that?
- [scoffs]

30
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,511
No, I'm serious.

31
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,615
I mean, the Monitor shows up here
out of nowhere and says

32
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,641
that you're supposed to die
on December 10th?

33
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,078
The last I remember, that article said
that you were in a fight with Thawne,

34
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,520
not some cosmic disaster.

35
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,981
- The article changed.
- If that article can change,

36
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,104
then that means that
we can still change the future.

37
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:52,989
So, what do we do first?

38
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,913
If a doctor told you you were dying,
you'd get a second opinion.

39
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,333
So, I'm gonna go see
this Crisis for myself.

40
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,343
Did you bring the cash?

41
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,721
- I thought Gat would be here.
- Gat's busy.

42
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,772
Change of plans. It's $5,000 now.

43
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,565
Gat said it was $500.

44
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,485
Okay, wait. Please.
I will get you the rest.

45
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,028
It's a matter of life and death.

46
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,030
[groans]

47
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,800
[gasps] Please.
I will get the rest of the money,

48
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,116
- I promise.
- Too late.

49
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,742
[Ramsey shouts]

50
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,997
[Ramsey gasping]

51
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,503
[Dibny] T-minus 30 seconds, people.

52
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,397
[Killer Frost sighs]
I knew this was a bad idea.

53
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,466
This was your idea. I'm just the guy
making dreams come true.

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,843
Twenty seconds, people.

55
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,095
[sighs] Okay. Fine.

56
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,305
Just do it.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,854
Did it work? I sound like Caity.

58
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,065
You sound like a non-meta,
thanks to Ray Palmer.

59
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,360
And as long as this
nanite camouflage cocktail is active,

60
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:16,489
your voice and eyes will allow you to
blend in with any group of regular Joes,

61
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,533
so you can, you know, live your life

62
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,660
without scaring
the ever-loving crap out of people.

63
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,537
- And what about my hair?
- Trust me.

64
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,871
You'll fit right in.

65
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,585
- [electronic song playing]
- Welcome.

66
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:34,424
Now, you two behave.
I'm gonna go find our star curator.

67
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,303
- What am I looking at here?
- Your next lesson, Frosty,

68
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,307
some of the very stuff
that makes life worth living.

69
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,225
Art.

70
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,186
[Cisco] Wowsers.

71
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:51,691
Is this photographer extraordinaire,
Kamilla Hwang?

72
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,902
- Hi.
- Hi.

73
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,696
- Thank you for coming.
- Mmm. Yeah, of course.

74
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,823
Mmm. Very classy shirt, by the way.

75
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,992
Oh, a very cute photographer
got it for me.

76
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,555
- She looks a lot like you, actually.
- I hope she doesn't mind

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,055
that you already got some schmutz on it.

78
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,583
I did not get schmutz...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely did.

79
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,627
You know, sometimes,
you just want your girlfriend

80
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,503
to have a good turnout for her show,

81
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,867
so, you make everybody clean up,

82
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,382
and who ends up with nanite juice
on their shirt?

83
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,884
Wait. Who'd you bring?

84
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,135
[scoffs]

85
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,013
You really do blend in here.

86
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,349
Except this place is so lame.

87
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,727
I mean, come on, this isn't art.
It's garbage.

88
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,605
Come on, Frost, it's not all that bad.

89
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,775
There are used tissues on this.

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,319
Okay? And this is just a plunger.

91
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,698
Oh, my God, look at the brushstrokes
on this one. All right. [scoffs]

92
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,535
Whatever guy made this
has some real issues.

93
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,579
Right, but, Frost,
that's kind of the whole point.

94
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,247
Art reflects how we feel,

95
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:52,293
so connecting to art can help us
plumb the depths of our soul.

96
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,754
[sighs] Okay.

97
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,174
What I am connecting to in these photos,

98
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,135
is that the photographer is afraid
to get a shot in focus.

99
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,262
Those are actually mine.

100
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,890
They're not all winners.

101
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,021
Look, I can take a note.

102
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,482
But if this is how Caitlin's other half
is gonna act...

103
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,735
maybe she should skip my next show.

104
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,161
Thank you for walking me
through this one, babe.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,412
No problem.
The suspect is Allegra Garcia.

106
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,748
She's 20 years old, she runs
a carjacking outfit out of Keystone.

107
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,293
"Thanks to her meta-human ability
to control radio waves..."

108
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,170
That's a new one, how is that possible?

109
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,589
Key fobs run on radio transmissions.

110
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,260
Anyway, Garcia has been
in and out of Iron Heights

111
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:43,511
and juvie since she was 13.

112
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,139
Last week,
she tried to hijack a car that belonged

113
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,808
to some guy named Salvador Traversoni.

114
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:52,103
He lost control of the car,
and as you can see,

115
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,730
he died in the crash.

116
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,774
It says here, an eyewitness
puts Garcia at the scene, so...

117
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,236
- open and shut.
- Should be with you working on it.

118
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,030
Mmm. High five.

119
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,577
Your Honor, due to
a preponderance of the evidence,

120
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,829
the State intends
to seek the maximum penalty

121
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,748
against the defendant, Allegra Garcia.

122
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,751
Which is why the defense
would like to plead out.

123
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,587
My client is aware
that a jury would put her away for life

124
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,255
and is willing to settle for, say,

125
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,716
- 15 years?
- Is that true, Ms. Garcia?

126
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,845
- I suppose.
- [judge] All right, then.

127
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,848
I guess we can
save the taxpayers some time.

128
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,684
Ms. Horton?

129
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,565
What the hell are you staring at?

130
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,815
Nothing.

131
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,485
Just, um...

132
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,406
Your Honor, the prosecution
requests bail for Ms. Garcia.

133
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,950
- What?
- The defendant is pleading guilty.

134
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:51,621
I know, Your Honor,
that it's a bit unorthodox, but...

135
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,332
we've discovered new evidence.

136
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:57,043
My office doesn't have the resources
to find anything.

137
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,353
We just need a little bit of time

138
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
to determine if the State
wants to pursue a lighter sentence.

139
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,465
In the meantime,

140
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,343
we request that meta-human dampeners
be placed on Ms. Garcia

141
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,178
while we continue discovery.

142
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,724
Counselor Horton, this court appreciates
your commitment to fair jurisprudence,

143
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,936
but are you sure
you want to go down this road?

144
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,021
Yes, Your Honor.

145
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,442
[sighs]

146
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,778
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

147
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,239
- Where will you go?
- December 11th, 2019.

148
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,574
It's the day after
I'm supposed to disappear.

149
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,469
Maybe we should loop in
the rest of Team Flash.

150
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:31,911
Not until we know the truth.

151
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,831
I just... I don't feel great about you
going in there alone.

152
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,667
I'm not gonna be alone. I have this.

153
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,086
[Gideon] Hello, Barry Allen.

154
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,256
Preparing for temporal
observational protocol.

155
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,258
- Is that Gideon?
- It's a mobile Gideon unit

156
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,981
I built from salvaged parts
of the plinth.

157
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,738
You'll come right back to this moment?

158
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,597
- Right to this second?
- I promise.

159
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,353
[door opens]

160
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,438
Okay.

161
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,321
[Gideon] Approaching Mach One.

162
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,031
Mach Two...

163
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,286
Now approaching November 30th, 2019.

164
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,580
December 1st, 2019.

165
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,457
Disruption barrier detected.

166
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,667
What the hell?

167
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,839
[grunting]

168
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,717
[gasps, groans]

169
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,854
- Your wound is still not healing.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,875
[Gideon] My readings indicate you were
exposed to an extra-universal material

171
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,484
that destroys positive matter
on contact,

172
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,879
a substance known as anti-matter.

173
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:47,904
Anti-matter? That's new.

174
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,823
There's a wall of this stuff
clogging up the Speed Force.

175
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,116
Gideon, how do I get past it?

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,880
[Gideon] Not without
additional assistance.

177
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,971
Fortunately, there is
an expert in the field,

178
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:59,415
Dr. Jay Garrick, formerly known
as The Flash of Earth-3.

179
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,887
- [Garrick] Good to see you again, Barry.
- You too, Jay.

180
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,515
You were right. You were hit
with a dose of pure anti-matter.

181
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,035
You're lucky you have speed healing,

182
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,436
or that scratch
could've wiped you out of existence.

183
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,356
So, is there a way that I can
time-travel past the barrier?

184
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,210
You want to tell me why the hell
you were time-traveling to begin with?

185
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,735
I needed to see for myself

186
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,047
if the Monitor was telling the truth
about what happened to me.

187
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,271
And I know what you're gonna say
about time-traveling...

188
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,742
Actually, I was gonna tell
you you made the right call.

189
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:41,207
For the past year, I've been detecting

190
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:45,294
anti-matter signatures
across the multi-verse.

191
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:49,840
Now, we don't know their origin,
but if my algorithm is correct,

192
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,134
all Earths could be in danger.

193
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,470
Then we have to find a way
to break through that wall.

194
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,138
Ah, your body never could.

195
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,684
But maybe your mind can.

196
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,771
I built this thing years ago,

197
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,107
the neural hyper-collider.

198
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,317
It harnesses neural electricity

199
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,195
and transfers it across
superluminal particles...

200
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,573
Therefore, projecting human
consciousness across space-time.

201
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,034
You could send someone's mind
past the anti-matter wall.

202
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,745
Not just anyone.
It's got to be a speedster...

203
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:20,912
in his prime.

204
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,163
- You in?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,668
Then let's hustle. I've already
had to postpone my dinner plans.

206
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,420
[Joan] Not any further, I hope.

207
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:33,718
Mom?

208
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,471
Barry, I'd like you to meet my wife,

209
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,558
Dr. Joan Williams.

210
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,727
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Barry Allen.

211
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,312
I've heard quite a bit about you.

212
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,609
[Cecile] Allegra Garcia.

213
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,213
Juvie offender from a criminal family.

214
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,988
In and out of the system
her entire life.

215
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,033
<i>The night of the particle accelerator
explosion,</i>

216
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,535
<i>Allegra was caught up in a fight.</i>

217
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,917
[screams]

218
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,254
[Cecile] <i>Next thing you know, she's got
the power to control radio waves.</i>

219
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,178
<i>Then she gets transferred
to the meta-human unit at Iron Heights.</i>

220
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,804
- At 15?
- [Cecile] Mmm.

221
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,265
Not exactly the justice system's
finest moment.

222
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,685
Now, here we are,
Allegra gets arrested again,

223
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,147
but my powers are telling me
that this time, she's innocent.

224
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,900
But the victim was
killed by a radio wave attack,

225
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,443
which is Allegra's meta-ability.

226
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,695
And an eyewitness
placed her at the scene,

227
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:35,988
even recognized her tattoo.

228
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,740
My powers have never been wrong before.

229
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,369
And I do not want this kid going down
for something she didn't do.

230
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's not guilty.

231
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,581
Dude, come on, those are mine.

232
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,041
[Dibny] Sorry, my bad.

233
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,399
You see these burn marks on the vic?

234
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,922
They don't match a typical
car explosion at all.

235
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,466
It's like he was burnt and toasty
before the car crash.

236
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,778
And we know that Allegra's powers
give her the ability

237
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,304
to control radio waves
and not heat waves, so...

238
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,973
Allegra might not have done this.

239
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,060
And I told Judge Hankerson there was
new evidence in Allegra's case.

240
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,979
Okay, guys.
All we have to do is find it.

241
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,733
But CCPD already interviewed this guy,

242
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,361
you really think the eyewitness is gonna
recant his story?

243
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,822
Well, eyewitness testimony
isn't always perfect.

244
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,907
Plus, environmental factors, stress,

245
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,077
even the order of lineup photos
can affect memory, so,

246
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,956
jogging his memory while he is at home
and relaxed might bring something up.

247
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,582
- Yeah.
- Okay.

248
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,877
Unit 37. Here it is. Uh-oh.

249
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,298
I always come prepared.

250
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,011
Oh, boy.

251
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,681
[Iris West] Allegra?

252
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,446
You're not going anywhere, okay?
We just want to talk for a second.

253
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,605
[screaming]

254
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,108
- [gasping]
- [Iris West] Wait! Wait!

255
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,241
- [device clicks]
- [grunts, gasps]

256
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:10,332
Allegra Garcia, you're under arrest
for parole violation.

257
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,425
I wouldn't touch that.

258
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,343
Sorry.

259
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,060
Jay told me he's a doppelganger
of your late father.

260
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,021
Mmm.

261
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,273
Do I remind you of anyone
from your Earth?

262
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,069
Yeah, you... You do.

263
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,528
Hmm.

264
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,364
Who is she?

265
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,950
Someone very special.

266
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,659
Ain't she?

267
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,706
I never thought I'd settle down,

268
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:55,753
but I needed a neurological specialist
to help with my depleting speed.

269
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,465
And something just felt right
between us. You ready?

270
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,092
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on.

271
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,178
Let's do it.

272
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,847
[clears throat]

273
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:10,601
Jay's helmet will help channel
the tachyons into your frontal cortex

274
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,603
and ignite your synaptic pathways.

275
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,691
[Garrick] I won't lie to you, kid.

276
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,111
Beaming your mind
past an anti-matter wall...

277
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,195
is risky.

278
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,864
I know.

279
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,659
But right now, it's a matter
of life and death. Let's do it.

280
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,409
All right.

281
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,418
[gasping]

282
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,053
[distorted screaming]

283
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,936
His biometrics are crashing.

284
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm also picking up
temporal energy readings.

285
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,819
[screams]

286
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,321
[Garrick] His mind has broken past
the barrier.

287
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:08,033
It's not just a new timeline he's found.

288
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,827
It's billions of them.

289
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,371
And Barry's mind
is experiencing them all.

290
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,797
[the Monitor] <i>In order for billions
to survive this coming Crisis,</i>

00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,842
<i>Flash must die.</i>

292
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,928
[yelling]

293
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,812
- [screaming]
- We have to get him out of there!

294
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,280
[Joan] "Oh, why should
the spirit of mortal be proud?

295
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,657
Like a fast-flittering meteor,

296
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,576
a fast-flying cloud,

297
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,830
a flash of the lightning,
a break of the wave,

298
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:59,793
he passes from life
to his rest in the grave."

299
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,631
Barry...

300
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,345
You're with us.

301
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:12,847
William Knox.

302
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,519
I've discovered that poetry
can stimulate collapsed neural pathways.

303
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,397
Lady Gaga usually works for me.

304
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,195
Ow. [gasps]

305
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,073
What's wrong with me?
[groans]

306
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,910
The device overloaded your neural
synapses, creating a near-shutdown.

307
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,537
What you're experiencing now
is called neural entropy.

308
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,290
- It feels like my nerves are on fire.
- [Joan] They are.

309
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,290
Because you're a speedster,

310
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,877
your synapses fire
ten times the normal rate.

311
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,170
So, you're feeling

312
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,547
ten times the amount of pain
a non-speedster would.

313
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,801
- You'll feel better in a day or two.
- Okay. Okay.

314
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,220
What'd you see in there, kid?

315
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,560
I saw...

316
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,856
billions of possible futures...

317
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,319
billions of deaths.

318
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,074
All their pain and their suffering.

319
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,661
And then they were gone.

320
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,039
I felt all of it.

321
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,877
Now I know the Monitor was right.

322
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,548
I have to die.

323
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,302
[grunts] I need to go home.

324
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,805
- Oh, God!
- Barry... Barry, you can't be moving.

325
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:38,100
Please, I have to see Iris.

326
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,604
[Dibny] Ow. Ow. Ow.

327
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,064
It's not getting any less "ow."

328
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,025
I don't understand. I thought
Allegra controlled radio waves.

329
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,611
So did we. But she fired
a heat blast right at Ralph.

330
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,322
It wasn't just heat.
It was ultraviolet radiation.

331
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,824
He got a sunburn.

332
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,870
Yeah. From hell.

333
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,788
Look at his face.

334
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,207
Most UV light gets absorbed
by the ozone layer,

335
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,460
this was entirely undiluted.

336
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,087
If it wasn't for his powers,
that "sunburn" would've killed him.

337
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,422
So, put some aloe on it.

338
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:09,840
Okay.

339
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,153
Can I just talk to Caitlin
for a minute, please?

340
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,845
No. I've got things to do.

341
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,407
- What are we gonna do about this?
- Don't even get me started.

342
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,393
Listen. Even though UV rays have
shorter wavelengths than radio waves,

343
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,687
they're all part of
the same electromagnetic spectrum.

344
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:27,524
So, Allegra must be able to control
all the different types of wavelengths,

345
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,737
which means she could've
killed Salvador and our eyewitness.

346
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,825
And I set her free.

347
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,955
Okay. Help me understand why
you pleaded guilty this morning,

348
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,999
and now, you're suddenly innocent.

349
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,417
A girl can change her mind.

350
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,378
What were you doing
at the witness's apartment?

351
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:52,257
Just needed to hash it out with him,
prove it wasn't me he saw.

352
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,635
That's something a detective would do.

353
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,595
I'm trying to be a reporter, okay?

354
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,516
Figured this was as good a time as any
to get some experience.

355
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,185
Get a story and my freedom.

356
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,937
But what's the use?

357
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,272
You'll always see me
as a criminal, anyway.

358
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,024
You know what I see?

359
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,278
I see that scared little kid
that I used to pick up

360
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,030
for robbing liquor stores
when she was 13,

361
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,115
that same girl
that I would check on in juvie,

362
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,117
who would always tell me to leave.

363
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,870
But this morning, I get a ping

364
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,849
that you'd escaped from your meta-cuffs,
and we find you in the location

365
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,375
of the dead State's witness.

366
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,001
If you're a reporter,

367
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,380
- how does this story play out?
- I didn't kill him.

368
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,007
Or the driver. I was trying
to find out who did it.

369
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,926
- I swear.
- [door opens]

370
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,136
[Joe] DA Horton.

371
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,347
I took a chance on you, Allegra.

372
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,725
So, you tell me right now.
Who really did it?

373
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,936
Tell me who killed those people.

374
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,272
You wouldn't believe me, either.

375
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,149
I want my lawyer.

376
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:01,577
This is insane. This is insane!

377
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,454
All of the evidence
says that she's guilty, but...

378
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,584
my powers are telling me
that she's not just innocent,

379
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,794
she knows who the real killer is.

380
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,213
I just need her to trust me.

381
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,092
All you need to do right now
is slow down.

382
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,612
What I need to do is find evidence
to exonerate her before the trial,

383
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,596
and I am running out of time.

384
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,699
Well, that's because you're trying
to do the public defender's work

385
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,182
and not your own.

386
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,244
You do realize how much trouble
you can get in, right?

387
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:30,230
You let Allegra out of jail
for an inexplicable reason,

388
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,457
and now there's another murder.

389
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,567
But my powers are telling me...

390
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,068
Two people are dead, Cecile.

391
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,695
You know this kid.

392
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,116
You know her rap sheet.
It's petty crimes and robberies.

393
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,952
It's not double homicide.
That doesn't even add up.

394
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,663
I haven't known this woman
in a long time,

395
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,457
and the evidence adds up.

396
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,543
We need to recognize that unlike facts,

397
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,879
feelings can be fallible.

398
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,006
Except when it's your gut.

399
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,008
- I've never said that.
- You didn't have to.

400
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,220
That is a scared kid
with no one to stand up for her.

401
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,682
The public defender's office
is overworked and underpaid.

402
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,808
Joe...

403
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,062
I'm the only one
who can prove her innocence.

404
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,148
Your job is to prosecute

405
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,734
the cases that we bring to you

406
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,070
using the evidence.

407
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,656
I mean, it's like you...

408
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,783
It's like you don't even
wanna be the DA.

409
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,177
Are you telling me I have to choose

410
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,703
between using my powers
and doing my job?

411
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,039
- That is not what I just said.
- No.

412
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,502
It's what you're feeling.

413
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,846
It was risky to move him here,
but he needed to see you,

414
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,767
- which we understand.
- Yeah.

415
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,018
Thank you.

416
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,775
Your husband stared at me
that same way when we first met.

417
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,193
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,946
You look just like Barry's mother.

419
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,281
- Oh.
- What?

420
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,495
Well, Barry's physical pain
will go away,

421
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,497
but the mental aspect...

422
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,499
Some of that won't, not for a while.

423
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,939
But I know you'll keep an eye on him.

424
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,380
Thank you.

425
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,219
[door opens and closes]

426
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,560
So, they are going to scan our Earth
for any other signs of anti-matter

427
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:35,147
and figure out a way to prevent
whatever Crisis is coming.

428
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,316
It's not that simple.

429
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,194
Well, you said you saw a wave
of anti-matter destroy Earth.

430
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,405
All we have to do is come up
with a plan to stop it.

431
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,034
We can't stop what's coming.
The Monitor was telling the truth.

432
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,536
We get Kara and Oliver and everybody.

433
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,790
We create an anti-matter dampener.
I don't care, we just find a way.

434
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,420
I saw you and Caitlin.

435
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,006
I saw everyone die.

436
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,926
The only timeline where
you all survived was if I died.

437
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,596
No. No, that's not the future.

438
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,806
I saw a billion futures, Iris.

439
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,893
Okay, well, what about the billion
and first or billion and second?

440
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,520
We control our destiny. We...

441
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,815
can change the timeline for the better.

442
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,276
Maybe this is the reason
I was given powers.

443
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,904
To save everyone.

444
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,866
You said this morning
that you weren't giving up yet.

445
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,368
I have to accept this.

446
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,121
We both do.

447
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:36,458
And do nothing
while you sit here and wait to die?

448
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,752
This isn't you.

449
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,799
The Barry I know
would never stop running.

450
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,635
He would find another way to fight.

- Hey.
- Hey.

455
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,744
Iris wasn't answering her phone.
Is she here?

456
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,997
No... No, she's, um... She's at work.
She's working.

457

What are you doing home? Are you okay?

00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:23,380
I got hurt running a Speed Force
experiment, but I'll be fine.

00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,047
Okay.

460
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,217
If you needed help
with something from Iris,

461
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,385
maybe I could help you out.

462
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,679
It's this case, Allegra Garcia.

463
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:36,726
Cecile has some
very strong feelings about it.

464
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,978
Need me to take a look?

How did you get hurt, Barr?

[sighs, mutters]

Ah, look...

You don't have to share right now,
if you don't want to.

471
00:24:55,996 --> 00:25:00,250
Just know that I'm here. Always.

00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,089
Something's coming, Joe.

473
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,342
I have to make a sacrifice.

474
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,636
But at the same time,

475
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,723
I can't help but feeling like
it means I'm giving up.

476
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,185
- Giving up?
- Yeah.

477
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:23,231
When I was a beat cop, you know,
I walked the same patrol every day.

478
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,277
One morning, I'm responding
to a noise complaint.

479
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,822
Out of nowhere, pop,
bullet flies by my head.

480
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,200
I got pinned down. I called for backup,

481
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,287
but everything was telling me,

482
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,414
that's it.

483
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,917
Next morning...

484
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:47,672
Barr, I can't even tell you
how scared I was

485
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,674
to go back out on them streets.

486
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,051
But you did.

487
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,636
Yeah.

488
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,305
'Cause of this.

489
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,351
Our badges, your emblem.

490
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,646
They're symbols of the strength
that we're charged with

491
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,065
to get back out there.

492
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,319
And we don't make the choice to die.
We would never choose to do that.

493
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,071
But when we hear the call of duty...

494
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,242
we're willing to make that sacrifice.

495
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,412
And that's not giving up, Barr.

496
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:24,251
That's what you call resilience,
and I know you've got plenty of that.

Maybe you should be listening to
Chester's molecular monitoring systems,

502
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,860
so he doesn't, you know,
turn back into a black hole!

Relax, okay?

504
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,448
I put the freaking alerts on my phone.

505
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,659
Oh, you mean, these freaking alerts?

506
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,078
Yeah, see, I handled the situation
and prevented us

507
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,747

by a giant death vacuum.

508

What did you do with your Tuesday?

509
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,002
- Nothing.
- Is that...

510

No. No, no, no. Stop, stop!
No, no, no...

- Were you drawing?
- No.

512
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,893
- You were drawing.
- No,

513
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,813
because drawing is for losers.

514
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,399
Mmm, looks like you were drawing.

515
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,900
It's really hard, okay?

516
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,611
This is giving me, like,
minimalist reductionism...

517
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,780
I was trying to draw this.

518
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,782
I've been working on it forever,

519
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,785
and it's not getting any better.
All right, that's...

I don't know why I thought
I could plumb the depths of my soul.

You do not stink.

527

You wanna go off
and be Vincent van Snow?

528
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,812
You want to show the world
what's inside of you

But you gotta understand that
other people are trying to do it, too.

I feel like a Yakuza baddie
is stabbing me in the stomach...

repeatedly.

533
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,830
Is this how I made everyone feel
at Kamilla's show?

534
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:29,209
Yeah, that's a feeling
we like to call guilt.

535
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,420
It's a little stabby, but...

536
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,507
it can also show us when
we need to make something right.

Do you know what I see
when these cuffs are off?

542
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,873
I see radio waves,

543
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,627
and microwaves and gamma waves.

544
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,922
And I can't stop seeing them.

545
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,176
So, how could you possibly
understand what I'm going through?

546
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,804
- You have to let me help you.
- So, you can put me away?

547
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,431
No! That's not why I'm here.

548
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,683
- Then why are you?
- Because I...

549
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,856
Because I'm a meta-human, too.

550
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,693
I can sense other people's feelings.

551

And, honey, I can't turn it off, either.

That's how I know that you're innocent.

If there's anything that can
help me convince everybody else...

554

please, you've got to tell me.

555
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:58,047
I told my arresting officer.
He said I was crazy.

I feel crazy.

get the same tattoo as her.

Barry, we were talking
to Cecile about her case.

599
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,557
Turns out that Allegra had
a cousin named Esperanza

with the same powers as her.

601

Everybody thought
that Esperanza was dead.

602
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,854
Esperanza must've killed the witness,
not Allegra.

603
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,939
Now, Esperanza can't let
anyone know she's alive.

00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,243
Cecile! Call the medic.

631
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,630
You know what they say.
In a few days, it'll be tan.

632
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:33,090
Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be alive.

633
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,300
We were right.

634
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,053
Esperanza Garcia was hired
to kill Salvador Traversoni,

635
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,846
then she offed the eyewitness.

636
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,492
She tried to kill Allegra, so nobody
would know she was still alive.

637
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:45,144
And you skipped over the part
where this Ultraviolet person

638
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,980
might have been trained
in the art of assassination

639
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,357
by a secret organization?

640
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,860
Yeah, that's on my "to-solve" list.

641
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,004
Yeah, well, it's on ours now.

642
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,798
If there's a group out there
exploiting metas,

643
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,657
then they're gonna need our protection.

644
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Yo...

645
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,328
What did you put in these painkillers?

646
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,206
Oh, you're not hallucinating.
That is art.

647
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,458
And some people might think it's weird,

648
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:11,212
but I think it's a beautiful expression
of the artist's inner life.

649
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,048
Even if it's a weird inner life.

650
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,331
You bought all this stuff.
I mean, how'd you pay for it?

651
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,403
- With Caity's credit cards. All of them.
- [clears throat]

652
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:22,014
Um, maybe our next life lesson
will be in personal finance.

653
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:25,893
Actually, I've got one more piece
to add to the bunch,

654
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:29,397
from a very daring young talent.

655
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,403
I think this ties the room together
quite nicely.

656
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,697
- [chuckles]
- Well, there's no accounting for taste.

657
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,994
You know, my mom dated an artist once.
He was a trapeze artist, though.

658
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:45,037
"No Net" Nick, they called him.

659
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,172
Two books and three bedtime songs,

660
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,926
but little Jenna's finally...
Finally asleep.

661
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,136
She is persistent.

662
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,179
She gets that from her mother.

663
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,309
Look, you stood up for Allegra

664
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,396
when nobody else did, including myself.

665
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,482
Well, you are the badass

666
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:17,778
that charged a light-wielding hitwoman
in order to save all of our butts.

667
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,906
[chuckles]

668
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,619
What's wrong?

669
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,752
I just keep thinking...

670
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,004
I'm not doing everything I can

671
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,756
to help the city
as the District Attorney.

672
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,802
The justice system
doesn't always work for metas,

673
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,182
which is why I want to become
a defense attorney for meta-humans.

674
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,685
I know, I know.
You can tell me that I'm crazy,

675
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,813
and we were not on the same page
about Allegra today...

676
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,649
No, no, no, that's not crazy.

677
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,526
- That is incredible.
- Really?

678
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,050
Babe, do you know how many people
you could help in this city?

679
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,489
Yeah.

680
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,993
And I know right where I wanna start.

681
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,163
[knock at door]

682
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,708
Um, hi, I'm looking
for Iris West-Allen.

683
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,086
I'm here about the internship.

684
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,213
Hi, yeah. Cecile Horton
told me to expect you.

685
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,798
Welcome to <i>The Citizen.</i>

686
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,342
Just don't touch the vegan donuts.

687
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,637
You can put your things
right over there.

688
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,816
[Barry] So, what now?

689
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:40,444
We'll keep scanning the multi-verse
for anti-matter from my lab. Okay?

690
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,713
- [door opens]
- But I think for now,

691
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,698
- we should get going.
- Yes, we should.

692
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,909
Ah, the intrepid reporter.

693
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,429
- I thought you had a story to put out.
- [Iris West chuckles]

694
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,956
Well, I couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

695
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,142
And I know it hasn't been
under the best of circumstances,

696
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,960
but I hope we will see you guys again.

697
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:57,878
- I hope so.
- [Iris West] Yeah.

698
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,589
- Until next time, Flash.
- Yeah.

699
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,806
It was a pleasure to meet you,
Barry Allen.

700
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,060
You keep being the hero we know you are.

701
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,187
I will.

702
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,733
- [Garrick] You ready?
- Yes.

703
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,496
I know she's not your mom, but...

704
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,167
Still nice to have a little hope
on a not-so-great day.

705
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Yeah.

706
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,297
I'm sorry about earlier.

707
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:45,801
Don't be.
You're in pain and shock and...

708
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,013
I was scared, too.

709
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,849
But seeing you at CCPD,

710
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,560
fighting with your all,
it reminded me that...

711
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,855
no matter what this Crisis brings,

712
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,691
no matter what you choose,

713
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,527
I know that you're never gonna give up.

714
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,032
I'm not choosing to die.

715
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,244
I could never make the choice
to leave you.

716
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:18,334
But if my death is the only way

717
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,920
to save the universe, to save you,

718
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,548
I'm willing to do that.

719
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:26,926
Then...

720
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,597
whatever we do next,
let's make it count.

721
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:37,061
We can start by preparing
the team for this Crisis,

722
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,732
maybe even a world without the Flash.

723
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,444
So, what do we tell them?

724
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,246
Beginning biopsy examination
on Patient 1-A,

725
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,414
Mitch Romero, male, 40s.

726
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,545
It is my hope
that this procedure will help

727
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,296
to illuminate the effects of my cure...

728
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,591
when exposed to another subject.

729
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,888
The body presents no obvious
signs of hemorrhaging,

730
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,099
but it appears the victim's blood...

731
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:22,731
has coagulated with an unidentifiable
biological substance.

732
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,985
Will run analysis on substance.

733
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,490
The substance could have been absorbed
into victim's veins prior to death.

734
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,993
[machine whirs]

735
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,755
[Romero roars]
