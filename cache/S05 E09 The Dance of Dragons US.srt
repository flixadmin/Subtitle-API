1
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,116
-Look out!
-Fire! Fire!

2
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,325
Get out of there!

3
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,876
Get out of the fire! Get out of the fire!

4
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,977
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

5
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,855
They were in and out before anyone
spotted them.

6
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,608
Burnt our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

7
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,944
-Dozens of tents were--
-Horses?

8
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,572
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

9
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,492
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

10
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,911
The northerners know more
about their land than we ever will.

11
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,246
Put last night's guards in chains.

12
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,415
Either they fell asleep or they conspired
with the enemy.

13
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,959
-Find out the truth and then hang them.
-Your Grace.

14
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,338
Unless there's a thaw, we can't press
forward to Winterfell

15
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,799
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

16
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,593
We're not returning to Castle Black.

17
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,179
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

18
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,266
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

19
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,157
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

20
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,532
Halt!

21
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,285
Halt!

22
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,749
There it is!

23
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,749
Open the gates.

24
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,559
It was a failure.

25
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,020
It wasn't.

26
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,897
I went to save them. I failed.

27
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,568
You didn't fail him.

28
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,530
Or him. Or her.

29
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,701
Every one of them is alive because of you
and no one else.

30
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,413
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

31
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,136
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

32
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,847
It'll get us all killed.

33
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,397
Out of my way.

34
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,384
You sent for me, Your Grace?

35
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,970
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

36
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

37
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,099
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

38
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,603
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.
In return, when I take the throne,

39
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,148
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

40
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,276
He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall
if he so wishes.

41
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,614
Your Grace, you named me your Hand.

42
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,491
Yes.

43
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,995
The King's Hand should never abandon
the king, especially in time of war.

44
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,955
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

45
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,374
A boy with a scroll could deliver
this message.

46
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,752
And if Jon Snow refuses the boy
with the scroll, what does the boy say?

47
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,173
I didn't name you Hand for your expertise
in military matters.

48
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,341
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

49
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,644
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

50
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,896
My family stays with me.

51
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,398
At least let me take Shireen.

52
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,903
-A siege is no place for a little girl.
-My family stays with me.

53
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,557
Are you all right?

54
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,358
What's this one now?

55
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,945
The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling
by Grand Maester Munkun.

56
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,280
Now that sounds like a proper story.

57
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,575
Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill
the dragon Vhagar.

58
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,787
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

59
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,039
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

60
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,291
hoping the dragon would only see
its own reflection.

61
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,419
But the dragon saw a dumb man holding
a mirrored shield.

62
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,046
And burnt him to a crisp.

63
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,842
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of Ser Byron Swann.

64
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,515
I made you something, Princess.

65
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,774
-Do you like it?
-He's beautiful.

66
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,152
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

67
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,447
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

68
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,490
Course I will.

69
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,077
But why am I getting a present?

70
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,913
Because you deserve it.

71
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,793
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

72
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,254
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

73
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,674
Made it this far without reading.

74
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,676
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

75
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,680
Wish I'd listened to him.

76
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,143
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

77
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,398
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

78
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,778
I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.

79
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,282
I want to hear all aboutThe Dance
of Dragonswhen I'm back.

80
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,034
You'll read it yourself.

81
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,976
Prince Doran. Forgive us.
We started without you.

82
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,437
Please, sit.

83
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,148
Princess Myrcella.

84
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,610
-Uncle.
-What a lovely dress.

85
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,112
-You don't like it?
-You must be cold.

86
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,199
Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees
with me.

87
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,702
Prince Trystane.

88
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,374
How's your jaw?

89
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,544
-A fleabite.
-What are you doing in Dorne?

90
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,381
Looking after the safety of my niece,
the Princess Myrcella.

91
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,217
And rather than send a raven or speak
to me directly,

92
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,677
you decided to enter my country in secret

93
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,390
-and abduct our guest by force?
-We received a threatening message.

94
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,811
The princess's necklace in the jaws
of a viper.

95
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,106
That necklace was stolen from my room.

96
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,825
Excellent. A last meal
before the beheading?

97
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,535
Oh, I can't behead you.

98
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,620
Many in Dorne want war.

99
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,580
But I've seen war.

100
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,708
I've seen the bodies piled
on the battlefields.

101
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,421
I've seen the orphans starving
in the cities.

102
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,756
I don't want to lead my people
into that hell.

103
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,676
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

104
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
And that is precisely what we are doing.

105
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,350
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

106
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,354
King of the Andals and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

107
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,335
King Tommen insists on his sister's return
to the capital?

108
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,172
I'm afraid he does.

109
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,176
I cannot disobey my king's command.

110
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,596
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

111
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,099
And my son Prince Trystane
will accompany you both.

112
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,561
If the alliance between the Iron Throne
and Dorne is to continue,

113
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,563
their engagement must stand.

114
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,357
I accept.

115
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,403
One more thing. My brother was named
to the small council before his death.

116
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,200
Your father understood the importance
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

117
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,328
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
his place on the small council.

118
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,874
-You have my word.
-The word of a kingslayer.

119
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,505
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

120
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,510
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

121
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,471
For their sake, I hope you live a long
and happy life.

122
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,349
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

123
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,318
May I inquire as to the fate
of my man Bronn?

124
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,196
Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing,

125
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,783
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

126
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,701
He said it was just a fleabite.

127
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,705
The fault is mine.

128
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,333
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

129
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,377
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

130
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,714
Prince Trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

131
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,174
I'll let him decide.

132
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,099
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

133
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,143
-I'll set your man free.
-You're a good man.

134
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,187
On one condition.

135
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:09,534
Why do we play? I'm better than you.
I'll always be better than you.

136
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,245
Have I ever missed once?

137
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,584
I don't think I have. I can't recall.
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

138
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,212
Which do you love most, humiliation
or pain?

139
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,757
That one hurt, didn't it?

140
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,135
You going to cry?

141
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,304
Give up, little sister.

142
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,973
-You're going to miss.
-Oh, I never miss.

143
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,350
You will. You're thinking too much.

144
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,937
Now you're nervous. What if she's right?

145
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
-Luck.
-Now it's my turn.

146
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,780
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

147
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,507
Am I gonna be happy at the end
of this walk?

148
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,384
You'll find out very soon.

149
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,599
Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?

150
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,186
The most beautiful woman in the world.

151
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,773
-And that's the truth.
-Slut.

152
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,486
Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

153
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,239
I didn't realize there were knights
of the Blackwater.

154
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,283
Only the one.

155
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,369
I believe you've already met
Prince Trystane.

156
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,663
Prince.

157
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,875
-Sorry about the other day.
-Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.

158
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,127
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

159
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm glad to hear it.

160
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,512
-Pie looks good.
-There was one condition.

161
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,564
Perhaps some soup instead.

162
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,112
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

163
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,700
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

164
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,370
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

165
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,208
-Oysters, clams, and cock--
-How much for your little clam?

166
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,386
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

167
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,225
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

168
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,755
Come on.

169
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,176
Some oysters, girl!

170
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,345
I'm talking to you.

171
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,514
Is...

172
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,936
-Girl!
-Tie her up!

173
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,396
Are you deaf? Girl!

174
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:28,941
Girl!

175
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,907
My lord.

176
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,204
My lord.

177
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,289
Lord Tyrell.

178
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,959
On behalf of the Iron Bank,
may I be the first to welcome you

179
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,253
to the Free City of Braavos.

180
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,757
-I hope your journey was trouble-free.
-A bit of chop the last few days.

181
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,467
Nothing too awful.

182
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,345
Good to see the old chap still guarding
the harbor.

183
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,889
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

184
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,266
Oh, the vintners say this might be

185
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,144
the best year for red grapes
in half a century.

186
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,022
If we come
to a satisfactory arrangement,

187
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,610
I'll be sure to send a cask
of the Arbor's finest your way.

188
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,279
I'm afraid I don't partake.

189
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,166
Some consider usury distasteful,
dishonorable.

190
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,377
Pure nonsense, of course.

191
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,587
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

192
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,340
Did you know that at one point
Maegor the Third

193
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,884
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

194
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,428
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

195
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,933
-and cut off both their hands.
-Most unfortunate for the glovers.

196
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,227
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

197
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,396
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose,

198
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,564
so why chance it?

199
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,317
Whereas the promise of reward makes
a man willing to gamble.

200
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,655
We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank,
Lord Tyrell.

201
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,744
You are the world's best gamblers.
And all those bets you won built this.

202
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,008
We should celebrate.

203
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,594
I'm afraid I still have a good deal
of work to do.

204
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,387
Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

205
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,055
-I don't have that gift.
-Oh, it's not a gift.

206
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,432
It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.

207
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,936
So give me a kiss by the Long Canal

208
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,732
And give me two kisses in Salty Town

209
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:37,570
For we're going to die tomorrow

210
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,198
The bareheaded beggar
The king with his crown

211
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,534
Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

212
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,286
Wasn't bad, though.

213
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,832
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.
Treasonous cunts.

214
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,460
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

215
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,254
This is the place, lads.

216
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,007
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

217
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,718
-You buying?
-Oh, I'm buying.

218
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,179
But I never was good at sharing.

219
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:29,372
-Sell your fish somewhere else.
-Let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

220
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,624
Come here, sweetness.

221
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,383
They say oysters get the juices flowing.
We'll take half a dozen.

222
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,719
Three coppers.

223
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,848
Here's a silver because the lady
likes you.

224
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,710
Too old.

225
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:20,923
Brea.

226
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,231
Too old.

227
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,528
I have just the one. Anara.

228
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,323
Our most expensive girl.

229
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,327
But well worth it, I assure you.

230
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,876
Too old.

231
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,220
-Do you have what I want or not?
-Of course.

232
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,723
Of course.

233
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,022
These fresh?

234
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,779
Come on, the lads are hungry.

235
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,452
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

236
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,538
-Here. Thank you.
-I'll have one.

237
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,541
Any vinegar?

238
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,462
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

239
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,067
Good.

240
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,787
I'll tell you when we're done.

241
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,586
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

242
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,672
Of course.

243
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,222
I'll have you whipped, girl. Go, go on.
Out, out, go.

244
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,777
Valar morghulis.

245
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,654
Valar morghulis.

246
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,297
And?

247
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,759
-The thin man wasn't hungry today.
-Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

248
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,971
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

249
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,642
A girl has work to do.

250
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,408
Your rebellion is over.

251
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,871
You can swear your allegiance
to me now

252
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,790
or you can die.

253
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,328
I believe in second chances.

254
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,041
I don't believe in third chances.

255
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,530
You write like a seven-year-old.

256
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,784
Your maester kindly agreed to copy it
over for me.

257
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,035
He didn't try to make you pay?

258
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,580
Maybe he's changed.

259
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,459
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

260
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:08,961
She will.

261
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,923
-You love her very much, don't you?
-Of course, she's my niece.

262
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,426
I wasn't talking about her.

263
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,471
You think I disapprove?

264
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,598
Why?

265
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,310
Because people disapprove of that sort
of thing where you are from?

266
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,937
They disapproved of Oberyn and me
where you are from.

267
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,064
Here

268
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,150
no one blinked an eye.

269
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,529
A 100 years ago, no one would have blinked
an eye at you…

270
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,324
if you'd been named Targaryen.

271
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,288
It's always changing, who we're supposed
to love and who we're not.

272
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,541
The only thing that stays the same

273
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,336
is that we want who we want.

274
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,723
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

275
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,433
that happened to the man I love.

276
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,772
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

277
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,792
Father.

278
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,547
Aren't you cold?

279
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,718
No. What are you reading?

280
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,555
-TheDance of Dragons.
-What's it about?

281
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,225
It's the story of the fight
between Rhaenyra Targaryen

282
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,727
and her half-brother Aegon for control
over the Seven Kingdoms.

283
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,772
Both of them thought they belonged
on the Iron Throne.

284
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,150
When people started declaring for one
of them or the other,

285
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,361
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

286
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,572
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

287
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,494
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

288
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,415
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

289
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,375
They never truly recovered.

290
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,002
The Dance of Dragons.

291
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,756
Why is that a dance?

292
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,008
It's just what they call it.

293
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,345
-Doesn't make much sense.
-I think it's poetic.

294
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,854
If you had to choose

295
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,608
between Rhaenyra and Aegon

296
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,738
-who would you have chosen?
-I wouldn't have chosen either.

297
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,576
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

298
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,578
Sometimes a person has to choose.

299
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,041
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

300
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,046
If a man knows what he is...

301
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,925
and remains true to himself...

302
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,639
the choice is no choice at all.

303
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,517
He must fulfill his destiny...

304
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,565
and become who he is meant to be.

305
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,069
However much he may hate it.

306
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,281
It's all right, Father.

307
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,826
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

308
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,580
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

309
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,374
Is there any way I can help?

310
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,177
-Yes, there is.
-Good. I want to.

311
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,265
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

312
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,059
And I'm your daughter.

313
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,158
Forgive me.

314
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,619
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

315
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,871
It will all be over soon, Princess.

316
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,961
No. No.

317
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,007
Where's my father?

318
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,218
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

319
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,512
Please, let me see my father.

320
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,973
Father, where are you?
Don't let her do this.

321
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,268
Please let go!

322
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,522
Let me see my father! Where are you?
Please!

323
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,317
-It's what the Lord wants.
-No.

324
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,445
-Please! Let go! No!
-It's a good thing.

325
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,405
-A great thing.
-Stop. Stop!

326
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,907
-Please!
-Hear us now, my lord.

327
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,452
-You can't do this!
-For you, we offer up this girl...

328
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,578
Please!

329
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,204
...that you may cleanse her
with your fire

330
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,165
and that its light may lead our way.

331
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,375
Please! No, please let me see my father.

332
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,003
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.
All of us.

333
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,634
-But if we make this sacrifice
-Accept this token of our faith, my lord,

334
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,552
and lead us from the darkness.

335
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,265
-Lord of Light, show us the way.
-Mother! Mother, please!

336
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,895
Mother, please! Mother!

337
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,521
-Mother!
-We can't.

338
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,940
There's no other way.
She has king's blood.

339
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,776
-Please don't do this!
-Lord of Light, protect us.

340
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,319
Please! Father, please!

341
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,529
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

342
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,825
Father please! Father!
Father, don't do this! Please!

343
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:18,497
Mother, no! Please! Please, help!
Don't do this!

344
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,042
Please, Father! Mother, help!

345
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,212
-No.
-No, please! Don't do this!

346
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,589
Don't do this, please, Mother!

347
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,135
Please, Mother! Mother, help!

348
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,389
Mother, help! Help!

349
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,600
Please don't do this, Mother! Please!

350
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,019
Please, Mother! Please!

351
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:47,317
Please! No! Please! No!

352
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,838
No!

353
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,638
Where have you been?

354
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,807
Just making sure everything is in order.

355
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,983
They're waiting for you.

356
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,027
Clap your hands.

357
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,519
That one, the smaller man. No question,
that's where you should put your money.

358
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,439
-The smaller man it is.
-I'm not putting my money anywhere.

359
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,566
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

360
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,776
Perhaps you should go find someone
who does.

361
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,155
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

362
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,241
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

363
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,243
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

364
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:29,497
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

365
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,292
Has your experience ever involved
any actual fighting?

366
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,461
You yourself?

367
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,088
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

368
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,510
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

369
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,180
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

370
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,058
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

371
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,810
They couldn't get their money out
fast enough.

372
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,813
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

373
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,273
or...

374
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,361
here. And the big men were always too slow

375
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,988
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

376
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,909
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
that one standing across from me

377
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,371
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

378
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,343
You don't approve?

379
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,805
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

380
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,974
I can do without it in my leisure time.

381
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,351
Fair enough.
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

382
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,813
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

383
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,192
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

384
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,569
especially when what is has worked out
in your favor.

385
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,154
I'm not talking about myself.

386
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,199
I'm talking about the necessary conditions
for greatness.

387
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,867
That is greatness?

388
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,746
That is a vital part of the great city
of Meereen,

389
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,165
which existed long before you or I

390
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,544
and will remain standing long
after we have returned to the dirt.

391
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,672
My father would have liked you.

392
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,478
One day your great city will return
to the dirt as well.

393
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,480
-At your command?
-If need be.

394
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,489
And how many people will die to make
this happen?

395
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,743
If it comes to that, they will have died
for a good reason.

396
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,745
Those men think they're dying
for a good reason.

397
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,079
Someone else's reason.

398
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,415
So, your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

399
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,001
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

400
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,212
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

401
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,173
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

402
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:47,635
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

403
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,539
-Your Grace--
-Shut your mouth.

404
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,064
-You can end this.
-She cannot.

405
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,649
You can.

406
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,624
Protect your queen!

407
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,636
Go!

408
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,664
Your Grace! Your Grace! Come with me.
I know a way out.

409
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:09,749
I know a way--

410
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,453
Stay close.

411
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,878
This way.

412
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,142
The other side. Follow me.

413
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,355
Protect your queen!

414
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:09,947
Drogon!

415
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,886
Valahd.
