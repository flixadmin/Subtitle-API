3
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,130
Hey, what are you laughing about?

4
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,519
Your last hearing today.

5
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,739
Then, directly to Central Jail.

6
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:12,459
Sir, a man wants to file a report.

7
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,099
So what? Should I dance?
Write it down.

8
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,799
But he's livid.

9
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,169
Says he wants to file a... cheating case.

10
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,209
Shimmy-shimmy! I danced! Happy?

11
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,179
Now file his report. Lodge his case.

12
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,789
Sir, his case is against
the President of India.

13
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,169
Who?

14
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,049
President of India.

15
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,079
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,039
President of India.

17
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,859
<i>Why're you hesitating? Write my name.</i>

18
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,679
Write...

19
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,299
Murlikant Rajaram Petkar.

20
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,989
I want to file a case of cheating
against the President of India.

21
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,579
Note all the Presidents' names.

22
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,849
Tell me.

23
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,249
V.V. Giri,

24
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,209
V.V. Giri...

25
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,549
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed,

26
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:03,669
Ali Ahmed...

27
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,449
Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy,

28
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:09,499
Zail Singh, R. Venkatraman.

29
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,659
All of them cheated you?

30
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,375
Yes! They all cheated me.

31
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,679
Hello? Want to speak to him?

32
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,359
A puncture?

33
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,539
Hurry. We have to go to court.

34
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:29,609
Damn vehicle! Hang up.

35
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,729
How have the Presidents cheated you?

36
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,269
It's been 40 years...

37
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,009
I'm yet to receive the Arjuna Award.

38
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,359
That's it!

39
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,224
I'll fight for my right now.

40
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,019
Take Arjuna to court.
Why drag the Presidents?

41
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,619
Arjuna didn't give you the award...

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:04:00,439
Sir, players excelling in sports
receive the prestigious Arjuna Award.

43
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,449
Did sir ask you?

44
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:03,979
Knowledge...

45
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,639
- Doesn't he already know?
- Shut up, blabbermouth!

46
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,379
So many medals. Do you play a sport?

47
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,549
Not me... him...

48
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,959
- Who? This old man?
- Yes.

49
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,039
What does he play with? Marbles?

50
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,439
That must also be a challenge now!

51
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,689
Sir, please.

52
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,119
Fine.

53
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,799
What do you play?

54
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,849
I used to.

55
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:29,379
When?

56
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,899
40 years ago.

57
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,739
Damn!

58
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,079
What were you doing so long? Snoozing?

59
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,469
Let me finish my slumber,
and after 40 years...

60
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,779
claim my award.

61
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,149
Hey, what are you laughing about?

62
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,389
What else, mister?

63
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,329
Tell me this...

64
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:02,179
why do you want
an award after 40 years?

65
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:03,919
For my village.

66
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,359
What do you mean?

67
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,669
I mean...

68
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,879
Mr. Bhosle from Tujarpur,
got the Literary Award last year.

69
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,869
His village has progressed so much.

70
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,809
And my village...

71
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,559
has no road,
light or public toilet.

72
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,649
I want the Arjuna Award

73
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,359
for my village's development.

74
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,439
All that is fine.

75
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,119
But you're a bit late.

76
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,169
Who will give you the award now?

77
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,819
What do you mean?

78
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,739
Khashabha Jadhav got it.

79
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,839
Who's Jadhav?

80
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,609
That guy...

81
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,139
Mr. K.D. Jadhav.

82
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:52,039
Khashabha Dadasaheb Jhadav.

83
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,729
First Olympic winner of free India.

84
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,009
Isn't it, Mr. Petkar?

85
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:00,629
Correct.

86
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,739
- How do you know?
- What do you mean?

87
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,309
I was there!

88
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,319
My brother took me.

89
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,559
Where? The Olympics?

90
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,249
No.

91
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,689
Karad station.

92
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,489
Long live, Khashabha!

93
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:48,269
<i>1952 Helsinki Olympics.</i>
<i>K.D. Jadhav was back</i>

94
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,509
<i>- after winning the Bronze in wrestling.</i>
- Long live, Khashabha!

95
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,369
<i>People from neighbouring</i>
<i>villages gathered at the station.</i>

96
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,849
<i>More than 10,000 people.</i>

97
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,669
Long live, Khashabha!

98
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:05,609
Long live, Khashabha!

99
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,829
Do folk show such respect
to anyone who wins a medal?

100
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,709
Not just village folk.

101
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,829
but the whole nation showers respect.

102
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,349
- The entire country?
- Yes.

103
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,399
- Hoist them on the shoulder?
- Yes!

104
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,529
No Indian has won
an Olympic medal before.

105
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,789
Not a single one?

106
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,789
- In all of India?
- Not a soul.

107
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,429
But it's only the 2nd Olympics
since India's independence.

108
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,829
We are all born as British citizens
before independence.

109
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:49,759
Me, too?

110
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,749
Yes, Murli.

111
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,929
Yes, you too are born a British citizen.

112
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:57,519
Don't tell father where we'd gone.

113
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,779
He looked like a king.

114
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:04,439
People were chanting...

115
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,409
Long live, Khashabha!

116
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,379
And Ma--

117
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,719
You got late today.

118
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,629
There were hordes on the city roads.

119
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,419
- God knows who had come.
- Khashabha, the wrestler.

120
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,949
He won India's first medal
at the Olympics in wrestling.

121
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,769
It was more crowded than the fair.

122
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,669
And more fanfare
than the Ganpati festival.

123
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,169
You're failing.
You'll make him a failure, too.

124
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,879
They know all the gossip.
But zero in academics.

125
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,879
They'll be empty vessels
when they grow up.

126
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,169
Eat.

127
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,639
Sir!

128
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,099
Yes, Kishan?

129
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,039
Sir, I'll grow up to become a doctor.

130
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,089
Why a doctor?

131
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,849
Doctors are God-like.

132
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,069
They save lives.

133
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,299
Well done!

134
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,639
Dagdu?

135
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,469
I'll join the army.

136
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,019
Why?

137
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,209
Soldiers protect us.

138
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,469
They save us from the enemy.

139
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,719
Very good!

140
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,839
- Murli?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,129
Sir, I'll go to the Olympics
and win a medal.

142
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:13,999
What?

143
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,719
The Olympics, sir.

144
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,339
I'll go to the Olympics,
become a champion

145
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,769
and win a medal.

146
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,099
Good. But which sport?

147
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,259
Kick the Stick.

148
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,999
Hey, what are you laughing about?

149
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:38,859
- You will win a medal?
- Yes!

150
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,419
You? A champion?

151
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,659
I am a champion.

152
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,229
You are not a champion.

153
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:44,399
I am a champion.

154
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:51,185
You are "Chandu Champion, Loser Champion."

155
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:52,379
Let go!

156
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,149
- Loser! Loser!
- Hey!

157
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,699
Why're you picking up the stone?

158
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,029
Drop the stone.
Drop it!

159
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,177
I am a champion.

160
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,919
Why did you fight Dagdu?

161
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,989
Don't you know who he is?

162
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,609
He's Mr. Patil's son.
From Kandheri village.

163
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,119
So what?

164
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,039
I'm my father's son, too.

165
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,009
He was laughing at me.

166
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,229
He called me "Chandu Champion".

167
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,629
I'm not a loser.

168
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,329
I'm a champion.

169
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,329
Really? A champion?

170
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,509
Of what?

171
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,879
Words?

172
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,059
He was correct.

173
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,849
What have you achieved
to show you're a winner?

174
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,239
Want people to stop laughing at you?

175
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,139
Yes.

176
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,629
I'll show you how.

177
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,569
That's Ganpat sir.

178
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:52,759
Only he can make you a champion.

179
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,129
Got it?

180
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,919
Beg him to train you.

181
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,709
<i>100 sit ups.</i>

182
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,029
- Idiot, thrash him!
- Sir...

183
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,179
Wimp, haven't you eaten?

184
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,759
- Push him--
- Ganpat sir!

185
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,739
Sack of potatoes, pick him, pull...
well done!

186
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,549
- Make me your disciple.
- Let go.

187
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,929
- Please.
- Who's this?

188
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,459
- I want to be a wrestler like you.
- Leave me.

189
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,529
I'll do whatever you say.

190
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,329
Mentor me.

191
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,519
- Who's this?
- Train me.

192
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,049
- Please.
- Get up.

193
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,219
Move!

194
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,059
Are you crazy?

195
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,359
Come here.

196
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,109
What do you do?

197
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,789
I want to wrestle.

198
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,199
First learn to stand properly

199
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,009
and then you can wrestle.

200
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,739
Fly away, little peanut.

201
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:08,109
- Hey, what are you laughing about?
- Drop that stone.

202
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,419
Please forgive him, Ganpat sir.

203
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:13,509
Let me go!

204
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,449
Stop.

205
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:16,829
Come here.

206
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,589
He's pea-sized but spirited.

207
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,879
- Want to be a wrestler?
- And win an Olympic medal.

208
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,879
Really?

209
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:38,019
Why do you want to win a medal?

210
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,529
I want to be like Khashabha.

211
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,959
10,000-person welcome party,
chariots and a band.

212
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,249
A medal earns a lot of respect.

213
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,799
Which medal do you want to win?

214
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,999
I told you... the Olympics!

215
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:57,281
The Olympics has three medals.

216
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,659
Which do you want to win?

217
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,659
Which ones are there?

218
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,539
Bronze, Silver and Gold.

219
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,649
Which is the most coveted?

220
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,489
Gold.

221
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,929
Then I'll win the Gold.

222
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:55,709
Who is this?

223
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,909
- The world's biggest champion.
- Champion!

224
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,909
Indian champion Dara Singh!

225
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,039
Indian champion Dara Singh!

226
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:59,529
Wrestlers, listen up!

227
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:08,068
My nephew Dagdu is wrestling
in the arena for the first time.

228
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,466
A new kid, a novice.

229
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,630
His father Patil wants
to show him off to the entire village.

230
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:24,208
One of you
will have to pretend-fight Dagdu.

231
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,576
And lose?

232
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,799
Yes!

233
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:29,261
How's that possible, sir?

234
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,699
If we lose against a novice,
no one will respect us.

235
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,879
- We have to protect our honor.
- Idiot,

236
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,610
Patil is my sister's husband.

237
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,924
He's very short-tempered.

238
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:44,289
Careful!

239
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,999
Sir, let him wrestle your nephew.

240
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,439
Bloody hell!

241
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,659
He's perfect. He's got strength.

242
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,489
But you haven't taught him technique.

243
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,159
He's the perfect choice... to lose.

244
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,359
Murli, come here.

245
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,609
<i>Welcome wrestler Mandar Gaonkar!</i>

246
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,239
<i>Look out for the new catch,</i>

247
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,389
<i>and let's start the second match.</i>

248
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:29,769
Where's Murli?

249
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,019
You want to wrestle?

250
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:39,099
Your results come today
and you want to wrestle?

251
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,989
No more wrestling.

252
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,859
Earn a single rupee,
then you can wrestle.

253
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,319
Papa, let me go today.
It's a big match.

254
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,629
For the first time... Ma...

255
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,109
My Olympic training starts--

256
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,809
Olympics!

257
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,159
The whole village ridicules you.

258
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,629
Do you know what people call you?

259
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:05,779
Please let me go today.

260
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,479
I'll prove to everyone.

261
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,859
I promise.

262
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:11,899
No one will laugh again.

263
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,279
Really?

264
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:14,939
Yes.

265
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,159
First, we'll go to school.

266
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,709
If you pass,
you can go to the arena.

267
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:26,539
If you fail, you will never
mention the word 'Olympics' again.

268
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:27,849
What are you doing?

269
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:28,979
Leave him.

270
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:33,599
Easy win for Kandheri's superstar.

271
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,229
Where's Murli?

272
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,769
Look... it's "Chandu Champion".

273
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:45,609
If you pass, it's the Olympics.
If you fail, it's the shop.

274
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:50,189
Failed, again!

275
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,069
The most coveted match of today...

276
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,269
This year, for the first time,

277
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,719
Patil sir's beloved son,

278
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:22,199
our adored Dagdu Patil,
will also wrestle today.

279
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,819
Applause!

280
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,899
Murli! Where's Murli?

281
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:32,229
Hey Sankya, where's Murli?

282
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,609
He took off after seeing the result.

283
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,489
What was it?

284
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,429
What else? He failed again!

285
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:45,929
Only he with true Maratha blood,
can fight Dagdu in the mud.

286
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:51,929
Anyone here has the guts?
To fight Dagdu, thus.

287
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:53,909
Speak now!

288
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,739
Is there anyone?

289
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,249
I'll wrestle him!

290
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,109
I'll wrestle him.

291
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,099
It's "Chandu champion".

292
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,439
The loser champion!

293
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,449
- Our wrestler will fight.
- Attaboy!

294
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,109
<i>Only one wrestler here.</i>

295
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,699
<i>And from</i>
<i>Mr. Patil's brother-in-law's camp.</i>

296
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,899
<i>Let's test the strength of Islampur's soil.</i>

297
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:29,499
<i>Long live, Kandheri!</i>

298
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,919
Will you keep going
around in circles?

299
00:20:58,219 --> 00:20:59,749
Fantastic!

300
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:03,429
The winner gets this rupee
as prize money.

301
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,789
Let's see who's the winner.

302
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,569
Place your bets.

303
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,153
Get up, idiot.

304
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,129
<i>As the duel gets intense,</i>

305
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:02,249
<i>both wrestlers face off.</i>

306
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,759
<i>Who will land the final blow?</i>

307
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,379
<i>Earn a single rupee first,</i>

308
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,809
<i>then talk about wrestling.</i>

309
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:15,789
<i>"Chandu Champion".</i>
<i>You loser champion!</i>

310
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,329
I'm not a loser, I'm a champion!

311
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,039
Now we're in trouble!

312
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,969
Murli, know what you've done?

313
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,669
Brother, this money!
We'll give it to papa.

314
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:28,069
- I told you not to mess with Dagdu.
- Saw how I beat him?

315
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:30,359
Papa says wrestling has no money.

316
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,819
See how much I earned!

317
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:34,349
- You shouldn't have--
- <i>This is wrong.</i>

318
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:37,789
We've been cheated!

319
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,339
They'll kill you.

320
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,509
Won't let you stay here.
Clothes and shoes?

321
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,609
- Pakya, my clothes, quick!
- Move.

322
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:49,219
- Ganpat did this on purpose.
- No!

323
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:53,249
Dagdu is defeated and
we lose our village honor.

324
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:56,439
That's not true. What're you saying?

325
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,339
Murli's a novice.

326
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,419
Novice, my foot!

327
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,049
Have you ever seen
a newbie wrestle this way?

328
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:08,159
Run the fastest you can.

329
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,219
<i>Thrashed Dagdu like a pro.</i>

330
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,749
Promise... it's the first
I've seen him fight like this.

331
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,629
He's lying.

332
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,199
They've insulted us.

333
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:21,599
They've insulted Kandheri village.

334
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,129
- Beat them up.
- Control your people.

335
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,109
- There he is.
- Thrash him.

336
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,219
Run.

337
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,999
He's getting away.

338
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,599
Run, Murli.

339
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,119
Look there.

340
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,659
What's going on?

341
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,649
Get inside.

342
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,179
Why were they chasing you?

343
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,769
Have you stolen anything?

344
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,449
Will I get stuck helping you?

345
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,379
I'm not a thief.

346
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,299
Sure?

347
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,199
Give him a vest. He's lying naked.

348
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,179
Please dress before leaving home.

349
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,639
Want to reach the Olympics?
Join the army.

350
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,649
- Army?
- Yes.

351
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:25,959
Have you heard of Milkha Singh
and Dhyanchand?

352
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,519
No?

353
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,989
They're Olympians.

354
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,669
They've served in the army.

355
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,439
The army made them athletes.

356
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,689
I'm here too because of them.

357
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,279
Meaning?

358
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,779
I'm a player, too.

359
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,559
A boxer.

360
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:53,679
Actually, those goons
didn't drive you out of town

361
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:57,399
but pushed you closer to your dream.

362
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,279
Tomorrow is the army recruitment.
We're going there.

363
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,379
Why don't you try your luck?

364
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:11,179
Who knows you could be
the next Milkha Singh.

365
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,779
Olympics training at the army? Seriously?

366
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:23,349
100% true. Very much.

367
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:29,509
Sleep now.
We'll go early morning to enlist.

368
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,799
Let's sleep.

369
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,769
63 dead.

370
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:08,889
Airplane crashes into the Bombay seas.

371
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:10,119
Breaking news!

372
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,879
Give me one newspaper.

373
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:15,359
<i>Breaking news!</i>
<i>63 killed in airplane crash.</i>

374
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:24,959
What happened?

375
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,089
Dead. All of them.

376
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,779
63 people dead.

377
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,039
How?

378
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:34,569
Incoming plane.

379
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,749
From where?

380
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:37,229
Japan to Bombay.

381
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:38,029
Then?

382
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,929
Torrential rains in Bombay!

383
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,569
As the plane turned to the airport

384
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:47,669
it stumbled and tumbled...
straight into the sea.

385
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,539
Dhoosh.

386
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,529
Dhoosh?

387
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,939
No one survived?

388
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:59,319
Have you ever seen an airplane?

389
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,249
No one survives a plane crash.

390
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:03,989
The plane swallows everyone.

391
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,749
Swallows everyone?

392
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,359
The train's here.

393
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,879
Gosh!

394
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:18,229
It's time. Hurry.

395
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,009
<i>Karnail was right.</i>

396
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,099
<i>The goons pushed me towards my dream.</i>

397
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:28,309
<i>It was my life's biggest lesson.</i>

398
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,539
<i>I learned...</i>

399
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:33,869
<i>when faced with hurdles,</i>
<i>don't be scared.</i>

400
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,859
<i>Gather the courage and jump!</i>

401
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,349
<i>Jump and you shall gain.</i>

402
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,899
<i>I left my home</i>

403
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,109
<i>but a new life was waiting for me.</i>

404
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:50,149
<i>Pradeep Sharma, Shiv Kumar Rawat,</i>
<i>Anil Joshi,</i>

405
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,699
<i>Vilas Sawant, Mohan Doshi,</i>
<i>Karnail Singh, Murlikant Petkar.</i>

406
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:56,559
You all have been selected.

407
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:59,519
You'll be sent to
EME Secunderabad tomorrow

408
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:03,069
where your military training begins.

409
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,789
Jokers!

410
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:41,269
The world's jokers were stuffed
in a train and presented to me.

411
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,939
You're all jokers.

412
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:45,769
- What are you?
- Jokers, sir.

413
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:51,069
Half won't even survive training.

414
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,689
Only he who has it in him
will make it from joker to soldier.

415
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:59,269
- Understood, jokers?
- Yes, sir!

416
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:04,229
A soldier's hair shouldn't
take long to comb.

417
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,109
And should be same for all soldiers.

418
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,069
Same to same.

419
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,189
- Got it, jokers?
- Yes, sir!

420
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:12,439
1, 2, 1...

421
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:22,569
Jokers!

422
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,899
A soldier's shoes should shine enough

423
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,019
to reflect your face.

424
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,239
Understood, jokers?

425
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,269
Yes, sir.

426
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,939
Up and down.

427
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,979
A soldier's teeth should be strong.
To chew iron, if needed.

428
00:35:58,769 --> 00:35:59,819
Got it?

429
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:00,989
Yes, sir!

430
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:24,109
And Karnail gave his hand
and pulled me in the train

431
00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:25,289
to the army.

432
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:28,399
And to the Olympic medal from here.

433
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,939
Olympics!

434
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:33,069
Hey, what are you laughing about?

435
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,479
Exactly, what are you laughing about?

436
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:39,529
Has any Indian won
an individual Olympic Gold medal?

437
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:40,489
That you will.

438
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:44,381
Does that mean no one ever can?
I'll win it.

439
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,679
You'll win it?

440
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:51,879
Olympic!

441
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:59,179
Hey, what are you laughing about?

442
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,649
Jokers!

443
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,399
Yes, sir!

444
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,569
There's no place in the army
for jokers like you.

445
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:17,899
Go back to your village.

446
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,649
- I don't want to go back, sir.
- You have to.

447
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:22,569
You're not fit to be a soldier.

448
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,109
I want to become a soldier, sir!

449
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:25,109
You can't.

450
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:26,519
Go back home.

451
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:28,899
I can't go back, sir.

452
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,819
I can't go back
until I've proved myself.

453
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:43,359
You should've thought about it
before fighting.

454
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:45,439
They were laughing at me, sir.

455
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,939
Mocking my dream.

456
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:51,639
Dream?

457
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:56,019
I want to play for India
and make my country proud.

458
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,359
I want to go to the Olympics
and win a medal.

459
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:02,269
It's been a childhood dream, sir.

460
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,649
What do you want to win?

461
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,439
Olympic Gold medal.

462
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:16,899
In which sport?

463
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:19,189
I'm a wrestler, sir.

464
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:24,019
The army doesn't train for wrestling.

465
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:28,819
But there's a sport
fit for wrestlers.

466
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,769
Meet me at 6 am.

467
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:34,069
At Tiger Ali's gym.

468
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,639
- Is this Tiger Ali sir?
- No.

469
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,509
That's Tiger sir.

470
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:54,399
Hurry up and make pairs.

471
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,799
- You're up, Jarnail.
- Sir, I'm Karnail.

472
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,849
Do I care?

473
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:01,109
- Naidu.
- Sir, Nadaswamy...

474
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,649
You and Gowda.

475
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,669
- Are you Manju?
- Yes, sir!

476
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:06,969
- Partner with Bhagpat.
- I'm Ganpat!

477
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:09,229
Why get touchy about your name?

478
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:12,279
Your parents chose it. You didn't.

479
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,429
- What is it?
- Ganpat!

480
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,089
Get in the ring, son.

481
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:18,329
Who to pair you with?

482
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:22,529
Sir, need a red carpet?

483
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:26,019
- Stop grinning! Where are your gloves?
- Gloves?

484
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:28,729
- Sir--
- I don't care about names.

485
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,009
Get ready.

486
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,589
Murli.

487
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:39,179
Tiger, what are you doing?

488
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,189
Put him in the ring already?

489
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,899
He's a boxer. Where else will I put him?

490
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,419
Not a boxer... he's a new recruit.

491
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:50,819
How dare you enter the ring?

492
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:53,249
- Sir, you asked me--
- Out!

493
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:56,729
- Take this joker out.
- Sir, one chance, please.

494
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:57,729
I'll learn.

495
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,349
One punch and you'll be crying for your mum.

496
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:03,449
Don't worry. I'm a wrestler.

497
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,349
Who do you think you are?

498
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:06,669
Dara Singh?

499
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:08,209
He's my role model.

500
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,589
Stop wasting my time. Leave.

501
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,409
One chance, sir.

502
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:16,219
One chance?

503
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,239
Boxing isn't a piece of cake.
You can't learn overnight.

504
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,389
Please make me your pupil.

505
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:24,219
I'll do whatever you say.

506
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,319
Fine.

507
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:34,049
You have a minute. Land one punch...

508
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:37,049
and you can start training.
Else, don't show me your face.

509
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:38,329
Come Kishan.

510
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:41,069
- I'm Karan, sir.
- Shut up and box!

511
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:46,119
Start.

512
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,239
Five.

513
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,039
10.

514
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:01,899
20.

515
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,589
25.

516
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,059
30...

517
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:17,249
35.

518
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,659
40...

519
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,699
You turned out to be a tiger.

520
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:56,549
What did your parents name you?

521
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,679
- What?
- Murlikant Rajaram Petkar.

522
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,519
Too long.

523
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,319
I'll call you Tiger.

524
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:07,489
Brother, forgot your own name?

525
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:09,319
Tiger is your name.

526
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:12,369
I'm Big Tiger, he's "Chhotu" Little Tiger.

527
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:10,869
Fire!

528
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,709
India's champion, Dara Singh!

529
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,369
Chhotu, sit!

530
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:25,619
He's my mentor, sir.

531
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:27,339
I'm your mentor.

532
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,349
- He's my first mentor, sir.
- Sit!

533
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,769
Well done.

534
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,399
These six soldiers from EME

535
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:49,149
will represent the Indian Army at the
International Military Games in Tokyo.

536
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:55,359
This tournament will pit
military players worldwide against each other.

537
00:44:55,593 --> 00:45:02,279
And it is the gateway
to every sportsman's dream...

538
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,189
The Olympics.

539
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,819
Winning a Gold in Tokyo
means a chance in the Mexico Olympics.

540
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:14,439
Can anyone here make it to the Olympics?

541
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,149
Yes, sir!

542
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:23,919
Sir.

543
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,159
Have a good flight, sir.

544
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,279
Sir...

545
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,269
Thanks.

546
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,129
<i>Have you seen a plane before?</i>

547
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:36,809
<i>No one survives a plane crash.</i>

548
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,669
- <i>The plane swallows everyone.</i>
- Protect me, Lord Hanuman.

549
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,989
Protect me, Lord Hanuman.

550
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,449
Protect me, Lord Hanuman.

551
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,809
Ali sir.

552
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,639
Look up. There's intense thundering.

553
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,049
Let's leave tomorrow.

554
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:01,529
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

555
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:02,739
What time?

556
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:04,109
10 am.

557
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:07,659
Cool. We'll leave right after breakfast.
My father owns Air India.

558
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:10,609
- Perfect.
- Shut up! Stand in the line.

559
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:16,109
- Chhotu!
- Protect me Lord Hanuman.

560
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:17,609
Chhotu!

561
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:19,539
- Catch him.
- Hey! Murli.

562
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,919
The plane will swallow us!

563
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,749
Stop.

564
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,029
Murli. Where are you running?

565
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:27,619
- Very dangerous!
- Who?

566
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,369
The lightning.

567
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:31,949
It was lightening
the day of the plane crash.

568
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:34,529
- Which plane?
- I read the news...

569
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:36,779
The plane... coming from Japan.

570
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,989
It was pouring!

571
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:45,199
It stumbled and tumbled
straight into the sea... Dhoosh!

572
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:46,919
Dhoosh?

573
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:48,869
What nonsense. Catch him.

574
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:51,949
Come close to me
and I'll punch you.

575
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,159
- I'm a boxer.
- He's mad.

576
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:55,409
Mad?

577
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:58,949
- The plane swallows everyone.
- You're scaring everyone.

578
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,249
- Hold him.
- He's a boxer...

579
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:03,409
- Catch him.
- The plane will crash due to the rains.

580
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:05,989
I'm telling you.

581
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,429
You... and you...

582
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,409
Save me, Lord!

583
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:11,529
Cheers!

584
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:18,249
Have you ever had alcohol?

585
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,159
Yuck.

586
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,579
Not even a little?

587
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:23,329
Not a sip.

588
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,409
I'm a sportsman.

589
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,659
It's bad for health.

590
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:30,949
- It damages the liver.
- Yes.

591
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,929
You shouldn't even touch it.

592
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,547
Champagne, sir?

593
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:52,619
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

594
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,409
Chhotu...

595
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:04,779
Karnail?

596
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:05,819
Yes, sir?

597
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,949
- Where were you? I've been looking...
- Nothing, sir.

598
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:12,329
Behave. I want you to meet someone.

599
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,329
This is Ms. Naintara.
She's a journalist.

600
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,909
On television.

601
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:22,459
TV?

602
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:24,069
They're calling you, sir.

603
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:25,909
Excuse me.

604
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:27,999
- Myself, Karnail.
- Hello.

605
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,249
His self, Murli.

606
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,029
- Shake hands.
- Hello.

607
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,699
I must say one thing...

608
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,209
Naintara is an Indian name.

609
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:41,829
- I'm Indian.
- Okay.

610
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,769
My father works in the Embassy.

611
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,749
That's why I stay in Tokyo.

612
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:49,279
- But, I studied journalism in London.
- Good.

613
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,029
Mr. Ali said,
you're both promising boxers.

614
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,449
Myself middle weight boxer.

615
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,619
Himself also... middle weight.

616
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,079
- Same.
- Yeah.

617
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,989
Ali sir was saying you're on TV...

618
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:04,529
Will we also come on TV?

619
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:07,499
Win and you'll be on TV, too.

620
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:08,979
I'll win the Gold.

621
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:12,579
- Straight to Gold?
- Actually...

622
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,329
he dreams big.

623
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:18,659
There are boxers from 55 countries.

624
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:21,289
So what?
I'll take on everyone tomorrow.

625
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,079
I like your confidence.

626
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,079
Best of luck.

627
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:27,869
Cheers.

628
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:29,369
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

629
00:50:39,364 --> 00:50:40,869
Just a little.

630
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,539
Aleksander from Bulgaria.

631
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,289
Powerful left hook.

632
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:52,289
He lands the punch and you're done.

633
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,319
That's Manuel.

634
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,409
Mexicans don't believe in defense.

635
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:02,489
They only attack.

636
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:13,599
Nakamichi, a favorite here.

637
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:17,329
He'll tire you with his dancing.

638
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,989
Finish him off quickly.

639
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:23,739
And that's Sultan Mehmet.

640
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,529
4-year reigning champion.

641
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:29,649
He's the only one standing
between the Gold and you.

642
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:56,279
Welcome to the 1964 Military Games
in Tokyo, Japan.

643
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:01,759
In the red corner, boxing for Bulgaria,
Aleksander Dimitrov.

644
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:09,109
And in the blue corner,
boxing for India, Murlikant Petkar.

645
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,819
Watch the left hook.

646
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:17,199
Very good.

647
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:24,609
Careful.

648
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:37,139
Attack!

649
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:11,899
Get him!

650
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:17,799
1, 2... that's it.

651
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:23,449
Your photo is in the newspaper!

652
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,739
It says "Launda" does wonders!"

653
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:29,124
- They've written "launda"?
- No. They've written "boy".

654
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:32,899
It was in English.
I translated it for you.

655
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:36,359
You can read English?

656
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:40,239
Yes. I didn't fail in school like you.

657
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,449
My English is like the English.

658
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:47,569
Everyone in school called me
the English Colonel.

659
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:50,239
Divide and rule.

660
00:53:50,629 --> 00:53:53,149
Didn't get it? You are fool!

661
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:56,229
Here's what they've written...

662
00:53:57,189 --> 00:54:02,729
"Wonder boy from India
knocks out Japan's Nakamichi."

663
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:06,639
What does Wonder boy mean?

664
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:09,809
It means, an amazing lad!

665
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:11,479
Which you are.

666
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:14,849
- Wonder boy.
- What a lovely photo.

667
00:54:15,229 --> 00:54:16,229
Wonder boy!

668
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:19,389
They're calling you
"Wonder boy from India".

669
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:21,189
Congratulations!

670
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,319
- Thank you.
- Thanks you.

671
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:26,599
Three knockouts! That's wonderful.

672
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:29,239
- Thank you.
- Thanks you.

673
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:32,519
All the best, Wonder boy.

674
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:38,729
Not "wondaer" boy.

675
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:41,409
- Wonder boy.
- Yes.

676
00:54:43,689 --> 00:54:48,189
<i>Karnail Singh from India is up against</i>
<i>the current champion, Sultan Mehmet.</i>

677
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:15,089
<i>Sultan Mehmet did not lose a single bout</i>
<i>on the way to his championship last year.</i>

678
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:18,689
<i>And this year he does not think that</i>
<i>anyone could be a challenge for him.</i>

679
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,269
<i>He is undefeated this year as well.</i>

680
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:25,989
<i>He knocked out the Indian boxer</i>
<i>Karnail Singh with ease--</i>

681
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:29,229
We'll also sit there today.

682
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,899
You're being stubborn again.

683
00:55:31,979 --> 00:55:34,059
That place is not for us.

684
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:37,059
We've been embarrassed enough today.

685
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:39,139
If he can sit there, so can I.

686
00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:40,859
I've knocked out three players.

687
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:42,309
You'll get us killed!

688
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:43,229
Murli!

689
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:44,729
Murli!

690
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,099
Murli!

691
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:49,439
Murli!

692
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:51,229
Hi.

693
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:59,129
Why take a fork and knife?

694
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:01,889
I want to eat like them.

695
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:05,889
If you want to become a champion
you have to learn all this.

696
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:09,229
Here...

697
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,349
Fork and knife.

698
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:17,399
Press and cut.

699
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,016
I'll show you how to cut it.

700
00:56:28,509 --> 00:56:29,649
Broke the plate?

701
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:51,849
Champion, really?

702
00:56:58,479 --> 00:56:59,609
Hey, what is he laughing about?

703
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:06,369
<i>In the blue corner,</i>
<i>we have India's Murlikant Petkar!</i>

704
00:57:06,629 --> 00:57:11,889
<i>And in the red corner,</i>
<i>Turkey's Sultan Mehmet.</i>

705
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:14,729
Come on, Chhotu.

706
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,479
Come on, Chhotu.

707
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:27,479
Get away from the ropes.

708
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:38,349
Careful, he's baiting you.

709
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,229
Chhotu!

710
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:49,089
Stop! 1, 2, 3,

711
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:55,959
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

712
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,979
Get away from the rope.

713
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,889
Stop!

714
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:40,389
- What are you doing?
- What?

715
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:43,439
- What am I doing?
- This... anger.

716
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:45,189
- He was laughing at me.
- So?

717
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,849
- So what?
- Let him.

718
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:49,139
- I'll smash his face.
- Do it!

719
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:52,729
But not with anger.

720
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:54,139
With technique.

721
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:56,599
Calm your mind and observe him.

722
00:58:57,689 --> 00:58:59,889
His right hand is moving slowly.

723
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:08,189
Clean him up.

724
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,269
Stay away from the rope.

725
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:19,479
Move ahead.

726
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:27,769
- Let's do an interview?
- What?

727
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,849
I want to interview you.

728
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:31,139
Sure!

729
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:33,229
Sorry, we don't have the time.

730
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:35,899
Please let me go, sir.
It's a TV interview!

731
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:40,019
Need to watch the other Semifinals
to study your competitor

732
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,599
and know what you'll be up against.

733
01:00:43,479 --> 01:00:44,619
We have time, sir.

734
01:00:45,139 --> 01:00:48,099
Yes, sir. I'll bring him back.

735
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:50,559
Promise sir. Karnail Singh promise.

736
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,099
Please, Mr. Ali?

737
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:56,979
Back by 6 pm sharp. Okay?

738
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:58,939
Okay!

739
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:01,889
But the interview will be in English.

740
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,769
It's fine. I'll manage.

741
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:05,109
And Karnail's there.

742
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:08,189
He was known
as English Colonel in school.

743
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,729
Sure, why not? Yes yes, of course.

744
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:12,769
- What's my problem?
- See?

745
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:14,729
Okay, let's go.

746
01:01:15,616 --> 01:01:16,389
Yes.

747
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:18,939
Sit here. I'll be back.

748
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:25,479
Please look into this camera.

749
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:28,979
Please say something
for our audio check.

750
01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:31,439
- Please say something.
- Speak.

751
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,279
Please say something.

752
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,819
- What do I say?
- Say your name.

753
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:38,529
Say something, please.

754
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:40,899
My name is Murlikant Rajaram Petkar.

755
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:42,779
- Village name--
- Louder.

756
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:43,939
Louder.

757
01:01:44,229 --> 01:01:45,729
- Islampur--
- Louder.

758
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,319
Say, A, B, C, D, E.

759
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:48,899
A, B, C, D.

760
01:01:50,229 --> 01:01:53,529
A - B - C...

761
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,399
No, no. Together, together.

762
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,069
He's asking to say them together.

763
01:01:58,939 --> 01:02:04,069
E - F - H - J - L.

764
01:02:04,439 --> 01:02:05,819
Louder, please.

765
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:07,729
I don't know beyond this.

766
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:26,082
You knocked out the champion Sultan

767
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:28,729
and now you're being called
the Wonder boy from India.

768
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,529
Do you think you can win
the Finals too?

769
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:38,229
Madam's asking
if you'll win the Finals.

770
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,109
Yes, yes. Win final.

771
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,479
Mr. Petkar, you're quite young.

772
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,609
What is your ambition...
your dream in boxing?

773
01:02:57,779 --> 01:03:02,109
Dream... what's your dream.
Isn't it, madam?

774
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:05,149
Dream... Olympic Gold Medal.

775
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:07,859
Olympic Gold Medal.

776
01:03:42,729 --> 01:03:44,069
Ali, sir.

777
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,859
The set up... and the English...

778
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:58,029
Lose focus from this Ugandan fighter
for even a second...

779
01:03:58,149 --> 01:03:59,479
and it's over.

780
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:03,319
Goodbye, match.
Goodbye, boxing.

781
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:04,979
Goodbye, Olympics.

782
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:09,439
Go sleep, Wonder boy.

783
01:04:14,939 --> 01:04:18,609
And the stage is set for the grand finale.

784
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:37,649
Come on!

785
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:44,939
Leave the rope.

786
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:48,439
Get away from the ropes.

787
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,649
Don't stop.

788
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,229
He's trapping you.
Get out, Chhotu.

789
01:05:19,479 --> 01:05:22,319
Get away from the rope.

790
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,319
<i>Goodbye, match.</i>
<i>Goodbye, boxing.</i>

791
01:05:51,689 --> 01:05:53,359
<i>Goodbye, Olympics.</i>

792
01:06:28,229 --> 01:06:29,229
Knockout?

793
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:31,649
In front of Naintara?

794
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,899
Rascal!

795
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:39,689
I wasn't in my senses for a couple of days.

796
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:47,479
Couldn't even stand to accept this.

797
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:49,189
Let me see it.

798
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:53,779
Silver?

799
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:59,439
You don't get awarded the Arjuna
for a Silver.

800
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:03,189
- You could...
- Impossible! I know they don't.

801
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:05,069
Wasted my time.

802
01:07:05,149 --> 01:07:07,859
He doesn't want the Award for the Silver.

803
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,819
What? There's more to the story?

804
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:14,029
Not now.
We're getting late for court.

805
01:07:14,109 --> 01:07:18,149
- The judge fired me the last time.
- Wait a minute.

806
01:07:18,229 --> 01:07:19,729
What happened after?

807
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:25,319
After Tokyo, I was posted at Kashmir.

808
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:28,939
- How did Kashmir come in the middle--
- Sit. Enough!

809
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:30,569
Exactly... enough.

810
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:33,319
- Sit down, Tambe.
- Sit.

811
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:35,479
You continue.

812
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:36,899
Tell us.

813
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:39,319
What about Ali sir and boxing?

814
01:07:39,399 --> 01:07:41,279
Ali sir was also in Kashmir.

815
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:48,149
But after Tokyo,
he wouldn't speak to me.

816
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,529
You messed up there.

817
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:54,569
2-3 months passed.

818
01:07:56,569 --> 01:07:59,939
Then one day, a letter arrived.

819
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:02,649
From the Olympics?

820
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:05,819
No.

821
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:33,279
Ali sir...

822
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,529
Sir.

823
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:39,859
Sir.

824
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:42,649
Sir.

825
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,029
Sir.

826
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:47,609
Please see this.

827
01:08:56,859 --> 01:09:00,729
Sir, I've been selected
for the Asian Games next year.

828
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,189
I've ranked number 1 in Asia.

829
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,109
The Ugandan who defeated me...

830
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,189
He ranks in Africa.

831
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:20,109
If I win the Asian Games,
I can still make it to the Olympics.

832
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:29,689
Sir, no mistakes this time.

833
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,319
Murli, we're done.

834
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,189
I won't train you anymore.

835
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:45,899
Sir, everyone's allowed one mistake.

836
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,189
Sir, he won't manage without you.

837
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:57,399
Sir, it was my first time
in the outside world.

838
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,899
I was blinded.

839
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,069
Just one more chance, sir...

840
01:10:15,147 --> 01:10:18,229
One more chance? Why?

841
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:25,113
I dreamed of the Olympics, too.
To make my country proud.

842
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:27,609
It wasn't in my fate. I couldn't go.

843
01:10:28,153 --> 01:10:30,819
Then you stepped into my ring

844
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:33,479
with passion in your eyes.

845
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,439
If I couldn't, you'd make it.
I'd help you.

846
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,529
But you turned out just like me.

847
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:45,109
Crashed before takeoff.

848
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:47,779
One more chance...

849
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,729
You were my 'one more chance', Murlikant.

850
01:10:55,776 --> 01:11:00,229
And you stole that chance... from me.

851
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:17,689
Ali sir... Karnail...

852
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:19,947
Ali sir...

853
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:36,569
Ali sir, get out.

854
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:03,689
Murli, take Ali sir.

855
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:09,319
Take him to the bunker.

856
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,649
Keep your eyes open.

857
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:22,859
Ali, sir! Eyes open.

858
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:48,399
Karnail!

859
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:51,029
Karnail!

860
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:00,069
Ali sir.

861
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:08,819
Keep your eyes open.

862
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,399
Ali sir.

863
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,319
Open your eyes, Ali sir.

864
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:27,569
Water... water...

865
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:56,529
<i>I'll go to the Olympics, become a champion</i>
<i>and win a medal.</i>

866
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:15,029
<i>I want to play for India</i>
<i>and make my country proud, sir!</i>

867
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:19,689
<i>I want to go to the Olympics</i>
<i>and win a medal.</i>

868
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:22,529
<i>It's been a childhood dream, sir.</i>

869
01:16:04,419 --> 01:16:06,099
Nine shots.

870
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:12,059
From head to toe.

871
01:16:13,809 --> 01:16:17,049
And yet you are...

872
01:16:17,299 --> 01:16:20,199
Yes... I'm alive.

873
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:26,049
Sir, I haven't even had so many
shots at the doctor.

874
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:28,189
Sorry, sir. The puncture delayed--

875
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:30,349
- Let's go quickly.
- Shut up. Sit.

876
01:16:36,089 --> 01:16:37,839
What happened after that?

877
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:48,129
A surprise visit by the Commandant.
Clean up quickly!

878
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:50,969
Who has kept the bed pan here?
Move it.

879
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:53,639
Clean the table.
Put it in the corner.

880
01:16:59,589 --> 01:17:01,079
Wipe the dust.

881
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,549
Hurry, quick.

882
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:05,829
Why is Petkar's shirt so dirty?

883
01:17:05,909 --> 01:17:07,679
Change the dirty bedsheets.

884
01:17:07,759 --> 01:17:08,909
Hurry!

885
01:17:19,759 --> 01:17:22,129
Who tied this knot?

886
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,539
Please... welcome sir.

887
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,579
- Welcome.
- Jai Hind, sir!

888
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:52,609
Move!

889
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:56,519
Soldier, are you okay?

890
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,379
Soldier, are you okay?

891
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:03,769
<i>Karnail!</i>

892
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:05,169
Enemy!

893
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:06,289
What?

894
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:08,219
- Enemy!
- Leave him!

895
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:10,219
I want to go to my country.

896
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:11,899
No! Guns down.

897
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,369
- Let go.
- You're crazy. This is your country.

898
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:16,479
- He's your senior officer.
- I'm not crazy.

899
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,789
I know the Indian army uniform.

900
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:21,559
You've been unconscious for two years.
Know your name?

901
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:24,079
- How will you remember a uniform?
- Let go or--

902
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,479
- I'm not afraid of the enemy.
- We're not the enemy.

903
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,609
You're in India.

904
01:18:27,689 --> 01:18:30,239
In the Udhampur Army Hospital.

905
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,759
In spite of being unconscious
for two years,

906
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,049
you still have strength in your hands.

907
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:58,859
- Get up, soldier.
- I'm sorry, sir.

908
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:00,449
It's okay.

909
01:19:09,879 --> 01:19:11,099
What happened?

910
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,349
He took 9 bullets in the '65 war.

911
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:18,319
Two years, he's been in a coma...
conscious only 3-4 times.

912
01:19:18,989 --> 01:19:21,539
One bullet is still lodged in his spine.

913
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:24,269
That's why, below the waist...

914
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:31,119
Removing this bullet
is a tough surgery.

915
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:38,019
No bladder control either.

916
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:44,549
Please move.

917
01:19:49,379 --> 01:19:50,799
Don't lose hope, soldier.

918
01:19:50,959 --> 01:19:53,709
You'll go to the best hospital
of the Armed Forces.

919
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,649
INHS Asvini, Bombay.

920
01:19:55,729 --> 01:19:58,239
There the bullet will be removed.

921
01:19:58,359 --> 01:19:59,839
You'll be fine.

922
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:01,249
Alright?

923
01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:26,499
Murli, now that you're here,
everything will be fine.

924
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,249
You're in a wheelchair.

925
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,659
Some come on gurneys, half dead

926
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:35,359
and go back running!

927
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:39,759
Want anything... ask me.

928
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:41,979
I'll get it for you.

929
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:45,729
You help me in return.

930
01:20:45,919 --> 01:20:48,519
A little help here and there.

931
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,779
Will your pension continue?

932
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:57,279
Murli, doctors view you as a patient
who they have to treat.

933
01:20:57,509 --> 01:21:00,499
But man has other needs...

934
01:21:01,029 --> 01:21:04,569
which I take care of.

935
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:06,629
Don't worry.

936
01:21:07,089 --> 01:21:09,379
This is your new home

937
01:21:09,619 --> 01:21:11,159
and your new neighbours.

938
01:21:11,239 --> 01:21:12,629
<i>Topaz, stop!</i>

939
01:21:14,889 --> 01:21:16,089
Stop right there.

940
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,249
I haven't moved, nurse.

941
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:23,039
What is this, Topaz?

942
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:24,389
What is it?

943
01:21:24,469 --> 01:21:26,409
You know this is wrong.

944
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:28,139
Yes, it's very wrong.

945
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:33,309
Bombay has banned alcohol.
Hide it or the cops will arrest you.

946
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:37,249
Why will they arrest me?

947
01:21:37,329 --> 01:21:41,989
I know you supply patients this stuff, Topaz.

948
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,139
Useless bugger, you are!

949
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:46,839
Major Gonzalves

950
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:49,279
takes a sleeping pill every night.

951
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,179
If the two mix...

952
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:54,299
he'll rest in eternal peace.

953
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:56,409
God bless you, nurse.

954
01:21:58,569 --> 01:22:00,669
Where do you think you're going?

955
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:01,849
And...

956
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:04,229
What is this?

957
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:08,559
Nurse, why show me dirty pictures?

958
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:11,049
What will the new guy
think about you?

959
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:18,099
Chatterjee is on the pot for hours
looking at these photos.

960
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:21,769
He has had two heart operations.

961
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:26,909
Such photos will make his heart race
and ultimately flatline!

962
01:22:29,789 --> 01:22:32,509
I am not done with you yet.

963
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:37,909
You... stay away from Topaz.

964
01:22:38,609 --> 01:22:40,419
He's a gambler.

965
01:22:40,529 --> 01:22:44,269
He loses his money in the lottery
along with everyone else's.

966
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:48,399
Stop now, I've never lost
anyone else's money.

967
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,019
Really?

968
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:51,679
- Enlighten us...
- Speak.

969
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,719
Whose money has he gambled away?

970
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,419
- Mine, nurse!
- Mine.

971
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:01,189
The lottery isn't gambling.

972
01:23:01,269 --> 01:23:03,249
It's a game of luck.

973
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:06,769
Precisely!
Playing on luck is gambling, Topaz.

974
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:30,819
Murlikant Petkar's house?

975
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:44,909
Long live the soldier,
long live the farmer!

976
01:24:02,339 --> 01:24:03,609
Ma...

977
01:24:04,969 --> 01:24:05,849
Murli.

978
01:24:09,089 --> 01:24:09,989
Brother!

979
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:23,029
Lie down.

980
01:24:24,989 --> 01:24:27,229
Relax, lie down.

981
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,929
Doctor, the bullet...

982
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,549
You took it out properly?

983
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:35,559
No, Murli.

984
01:24:37,379 --> 01:24:39,489
The bullet is lodged such that

985
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:43,159
if I try to remove it,
it could further damage you.

986
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:45,619
Your whole body could get paralysed.

987
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:52,789
How will I walk?

988
01:24:53,019 --> 01:24:54,929
Murli, you took nine bullets.

989
01:24:55,009 --> 01:24:58,269
You should be grateful to be alive.

990
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,029
I'm a sportsman, sir.

991
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:06,799
What use is such a life for me?

992
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:17,179
Murli!

993
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:19,249
Don't worry.

994
01:25:19,549 --> 01:25:22,139
Look at me.

995
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:26,189
Once you're back home,
everything will be fine.

996
01:25:26,419 --> 01:25:28,059
Okay?

997
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:30,479
Your mother will care for you.

998
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:34,739
Don't cry.

999
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:37,379
Don't worry.

1000
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:55,679
Isn't this a lovely place?

1001
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:05,309
Murli, I spoke to the doctor.

1002
01:26:06,599 --> 01:26:08,629
Do you know what he said?

1003
01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:16,279
He said, if you swim,
you'll gain strength.

1004
01:26:16,599 --> 01:26:18,459
Swim daily.

1005
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:20,429
You'll recover faster.

1006
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,619
I don't want to stay here.

1007
01:26:24,049 --> 01:26:25,899
I want to go home, brother.

1008
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:37,029
Mother is old.

1009
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:42,779
Dad and I run the shop the whole day.

1010
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:47,049
The kids...

1011
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:49,989
they need something or the other.

1012
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:57,549
You haven't been to the village
since so long.

1013
01:26:57,929 --> 01:27:01,539
Coming back in this condition...

1014
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:07,159
You don't even have bladder control.

1015
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:09,539
There are doctors here.

1016
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:11,659
Nurses, also. You have help.

1017
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,949
You have everything here.

1018
01:27:17,169 --> 01:27:18,419
At home...

1019
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:20,359
Plus the money issue...

1020
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:31,119
Murli, I'm not saying you can't come home.

1021
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,779
It's your home.

1022
01:27:37,969 --> 01:27:40,549
But think about it.

1023
01:27:41,629 --> 01:27:45,289
You'll be better off here.

1024
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:49,449
Don't worry about mother.

1025
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:56,579
I'll tell her the doctors said,
"Murli will recover faster here."

1026
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:01,269
You're my champion.

1027
01:29:13,779 --> 01:29:15,199
Mother...

1028
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:35,259
Sir, the court is calling.

1029
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:39,239
It's time for the appearance.
I'll have to answer.

1030
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:43,269
Hello? Yes... Kamble sir has left.

1031
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:45,139
It's been a while.

1032
01:29:45,369 --> 01:29:48,779
Sir has left.

1033
01:29:49,569 --> 01:29:51,119
It's been 20 minutes.

1034
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:55,329
He's on his way to court.

1035
01:29:55,409 --> 01:29:57,239
You can't get through to Kamble sir?

1036
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:01,389
Can't get through to Kamble sir!

1037
01:30:01,589 --> 01:30:04,239
Network is sometimes a problem.

1038
01:30:04,389 --> 01:30:06,479
Sorry, sir. Bye.

1039
01:30:14,389 --> 01:30:18,519
Dad, you never mentioned
Jagannath uncle did that.

1040
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:23,619
There's something graver

1041
01:30:25,029 --> 01:30:28,939
I've never told anyone.

1042
01:30:29,019 --> 01:30:29,969
What, Dad?

1043
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:35,699
I hope you understand it now.

1044
01:30:37,769 --> 01:30:40,899
It was my birthday...

1045
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,959
Happy birthday to you!

1046
01:30:44,529 --> 01:30:47,919
<i>There was nothing in life</i>
<i>worth celebrating.</i>

1047
01:30:49,369 --> 01:30:52,939
<i>But Topaz saw my birthdate in the records.</i>

1048
01:30:53,999 --> 01:30:55,619
<i>So, I had to cut a cake.</i>

1049
01:31:00,029 --> 01:31:01,289
Great, Murli!

1050
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:02,869
You're a year older.

1051
01:31:03,259 --> 01:31:06,909
What do you want as a gift?
I'll get it for you.

1052
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:11,449
A bottle of whiskey?

1053
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:14,149
Whiskey.

1054
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:16,909
What? Murli!

1055
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,869
But you don't drink.

1056
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:24,489
You just said, I'm older now.

1057
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:27,009
No! It's very dangerous.

1058
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:31,939
You saw how the nurse fired me.

1059
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:35,779
I'll lose my job if I get caught.

1060
01:31:38,339 --> 01:31:42,629
If you get me whiskey...

1061
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:48,229
If you get me whiskey,

1062
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:51,359
I'll give you money for the lottery.

1063
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,089
- The lottery?
- Yes.

1064
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,749
No, it's very dangerous.

1065
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:02,089
How much?

1066
01:32:10,549 --> 01:32:11,789
100 rupees!

1067
01:32:23,009 --> 01:32:25,159
Happy birthday, Murli brother!

1068
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:31,889
Drink up. Easy.

1069
01:32:32,879 --> 01:32:36,939
Last evening, God spoke in my dream...

1070
01:32:37,409 --> 01:32:42,519
Topaz, bet on the numbers I tell you.

1071
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:44,749
You'll hit the jackpot.

1072
01:32:45,869 --> 01:32:48,689
Want to try your luck on your birthday?

1073
01:32:50,349 --> 01:32:52,119
Bet all I've got.

1074
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:58,169
Lately, God and I don't get along.

1075
01:32:58,559 --> 01:33:02,049
So, bet on a number above
what He said to you.

1076
01:33:02,129 --> 01:33:06,019
That'll be 1, 2, 3.

1077
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:07,349
So?

1078
01:33:07,809 --> 01:33:10,589
That sequence hasn't come in decades.

1079
01:33:10,959 --> 01:33:14,729
And if someone does get it,
then you're God's favorite.

1080
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:16,219
It's settled, then.

1081
01:33:16,619 --> 01:33:20,309
Let's see who's His favorite.

1082
01:33:21,099 --> 01:33:22,359
Is it?

1083
01:33:23,349 --> 01:33:24,639
I'm off.

1084
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:39,609
<i>Last five minutes.</i>

1085
01:33:39,999 --> 01:33:41,899
<i>No more bets after this.</i>

1086
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:46,799
<i>Place your bets. Last five minutes.</i>

1087
01:33:47,109 --> 01:33:51,179
Place your bets. Last five minutes.

1088
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:55,249
I bet 100 rupees.

1089
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:57,019
- 100?
- 100 rupees.

1090
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,899
- What numbers?
- 2, 3, 4.

1091
01:34:06,049 --> 01:34:07,889
- Another 100.
- 100 more?

1092
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:09,699
On 1, 2, 3.

1093
01:34:15,109 --> 01:34:18,459
- Whose pocket have you picked?
- Shut up!

1094
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:21,079
I'm a reputable man.

1095
01:34:31,919 --> 01:34:34,359
Ratan Khatri is here.

1096
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:43,159
Today's number will be revealed
to see who's the lucky winner.

1097
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:46,939
Who'll pick the first number?

1098
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:47,859
Me!

1099
01:34:53,969 --> 01:34:56,809
The first number is... two!

1100
01:34:57,929 --> 01:34:59,839
Two! My money has doubled.

1101
01:35:01,639 --> 01:35:03,569
Second number is, three.

1102
01:35:03,649 --> 01:35:04,799
Three.

1103
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:13,039
I'm winning the jackpot.
Next number... four.

1104
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:17,109
I told Murli to bet on 2, 3, 4.

1105
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:21,839
Today's last number...

1106
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:26,199
Today's last number is... one!

1107
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:27,379
Ace.

1108
01:35:27,459 --> 01:35:30,969
1, 2, 3.

1109
01:35:31,049 --> 01:35:37,019
Who's the lucky person
who bet on 1, 2, 3?

1110
01:35:37,429 --> 01:35:38,469
Murli!

1111
01:35:38,679 --> 01:35:41,069
Brother!

1112
01:35:41,209 --> 01:35:42,779
Get up.

1113
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:45,569
Murli, get up.

1114
01:35:47,129 --> 01:35:48,819
How much have you had to drink?

1115
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:52,339
Murli, get up. You won the jackpot!

1116
01:35:52,869 --> 01:35:56,289
You've won 44,000 in the lottery.

1117
01:35:56,369 --> 01:35:58,619
44,000!

1118
01:35:58,849 --> 01:36:01,599
Let's collect the prize money.

1119
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:07,559
He's throwing up something rotten.

1120
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,899
Are you okay, brother?

1121
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,099
Topaz, I need to pee.

1122
01:36:20,369 --> 01:36:21,909
- Pee?
- Yes.

1123
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:23,939
But how do you know?

1124
01:36:24,019 --> 01:36:25,319
I don't know.

1125
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:27,039
I'm feeling the pressure!

1126
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:29,189
Pressure! What do you mean?

1127
01:36:29,559 --> 01:36:31,929
Sensation in your pelvis!

1128
01:36:32,649 --> 01:36:37,459
Money in and pee out.
All in one night!

1129
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:42,229
Happy birthday!
Get up and let's get the money.

1130
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:55,069
It's been 10 years since
anyone got a 1, 2, 3.

1131
01:36:57,079 --> 01:36:59,249
You're God's favorite.

1132
01:36:59,649 --> 01:37:01,549
No one has such luck.

1133
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:06,409
Whatever you touch will turn to gold.

1134
01:37:09,269 --> 01:37:11,639
Ratan Khatri was right.

1135
01:37:12,599 --> 01:37:14,809
Whatever my business with God,

1136
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:18,089
it wasn't in His plans
for me to die this way.

1137
01:37:18,839 --> 01:37:22,329
In Kandheri, Patil's people chased me.

1138
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:24,129
I survived.

1139
01:37:24,579 --> 01:37:27,739
I took nine bullets. And survived.

1140
01:37:29,019 --> 01:37:32,299
I swallowed 30 sleeping pills,
with whiskey

1141
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:35,219
and I puked it all out.

1142
01:37:36,979 --> 01:37:40,159
That day, I decided I would live.

1143
01:37:41,659 --> 01:37:45,739
And fight with everything
I've got, to live.

1144
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:49,649
<i>I tried my best.</i>

1145
01:37:50,169 --> 01:37:54,869
<i>I couldn't stand up and box,</i>
<i>so I started swimming.</i>

1146
01:37:55,189 --> 01:38:00,319
<i>Topaz said, everyone is equal in water.</i>

1147
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:03,509
<i>Even fish don't have legs!</i>

1148
01:38:13,409 --> 01:38:16,029
War is nasty, Chhotu.

1149
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:19,929
The ones who start it, lose nothing.

1150
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,169
The ones who fight it, lose everything.

1151
01:38:26,369 --> 01:38:29,669
Karnail was my first and only friend.

1152
01:38:31,449 --> 01:38:34,749
If he hadn't extended his hand
in the train...

1153
01:38:37,169 --> 01:38:39,789
I would've still been in that village.

1154
01:38:41,429 --> 01:38:44,149
Dead or alive, who knows.

1155
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,609
And in front of my eyes...

1156
01:38:58,619 --> 01:39:01,799
I'll take you someplace tomorrow.

1157
01:39:06,259 --> 01:39:07,409
Where?

1158
01:39:08,139 --> 01:39:11,509
Dara!

1159
01:39:14,269 --> 01:39:16,619
Dara!

1160
01:39:28,419 --> 01:39:29,649
Seeing this?

1161
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:34,589
He's 40 but still fights.

1162
01:39:35,879 --> 01:39:37,139
Know why?

1163
01:39:38,959 --> 01:39:42,109
He saw a dream that hasn't come true.

1164
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:45,169
To be a world champion.

1165
01:39:46,879 --> 01:39:49,259
Dara!

1166
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:54,939
You consider him your first mentor,
don't you?

1167
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:59,559
I always wanted to be like him.

1168
01:39:59,879 --> 01:40:01,269
What changed?

1169
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:02,789
What?

1170
01:40:02,869 --> 01:40:05,939
Why did you stop trying?

1171
01:40:07,559 --> 01:40:09,509
What are you saying, Ali sir?

1172
01:40:09,789 --> 01:40:13,869
- You know...
- I don't.

1173
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:20,009
If this man can fight at 40,
why did you stop trying?

1174
01:40:20,089 --> 01:40:21,629
My legs don't function.

1175
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:23,629
- So!
- So?

1176
01:40:23,709 --> 01:40:24,989
You stopped living?

1177
01:40:25,069 --> 01:40:28,739
- No, but...
- Then why stop dreaming?

1178
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:32,639
I don't get it.

1179
01:40:33,619 --> 01:40:35,949
I can't dream sitting
in this condition.

1180
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:37,739
I can only exist.

1181
01:40:39,419 --> 01:40:40,899
Exist...

1182
01:40:43,779 --> 01:40:49,789
Heard of someone who doesn't have
both legs but can lift 310 kgs?

1183
01:40:49,899 --> 01:40:53,799
A man without a leg,
but can high jump five feet?

1184
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:58,349
A woman crushed under a truck,
who lost her limbs

1185
01:40:58,429 --> 01:41:00,989
but wins the Gold in cycling?

1186
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,059
Heard such stories?

1187
01:41:06,009 --> 01:41:07,479
I have.

1188
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:12,079
These are Paralympic participants.

1189
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:15,909
Paralympics?

1190
01:41:20,659 --> 01:41:25,179
A dream is over when we stop dreaming.

1191
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:27,759
Your childhood dream isn't over yet.

1192
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:32,409
If you strive,
you can still reach the Olympics.

1193
01:41:37,869 --> 01:41:41,849
Learn from your first mentor.

1194
01:41:43,629 --> 01:41:48,809
A champion may fall,
but they never stop.

1195
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:53,189
Winning isn't defeating your opponent.

1196
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:56,469
True winning is silencing that voice

1197
01:41:56,549 --> 01:41:59,369
that says you've lost... without trying.

1198
01:41:59,469 --> 01:42:01,829
Win over that voice.

1199
01:42:03,589 --> 01:42:08,039
Then you'll be a true champion
and win an Olympic medal.

1200
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:19,519
That's who you have to become.

1201
01:42:19,749 --> 01:42:20,909
Will you?

1202
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:26,459
Can you?

1203
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:29,309
Will you become a champion?

1204
01:42:29,509 --> 01:42:31,369
I will!

1205
01:42:31,829 --> 01:42:34,739
I'll become a champion!

1206
01:44:04,959 --> 01:44:05,839
Again.

1207
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:48,799
Did Mr. Petkar come back?

1208
01:45:48,879 --> 01:45:50,059
No, sir.

1209
01:45:50,539 --> 01:45:52,439
What's his village's name?

1210
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:54,149
Islampur.

1211
01:45:55,259 --> 01:45:56,429
Sir...

1212
01:45:57,869 --> 01:45:59,639
Mr. Petkar was right.

1213
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:05,419
If he's telling the truth,
you'll get all the credit.

1214
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,579
He has won
an international Silver medal.

1215
01:46:08,659 --> 01:46:10,339
For the army! Not a joke.

1216
01:46:10,419 --> 01:46:11,939
Shut up, weasel!

1217
01:46:12,509 --> 01:46:14,469
Why instigate sir?

1218
01:46:14,729 --> 01:46:16,239
If Petkar's lying...

1219
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:18,889
sir will lose his job. What then?

1220
01:46:21,049 --> 01:46:23,969
I've got a fantastic idea.

1221
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:25,829
I can tell you--

1222
01:46:26,229 --> 01:46:27,999
Quiet! Want a beating?

1223
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:28,959
- Quiet!
- Hear him?

1224
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:30,429
I'm telling you! Quiet.

1225
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:32,649
What's your idea? Get him down.

1226
01:46:32,729 --> 01:46:34,529
I'm coming, sir. Open it.

1227
01:46:34,669 --> 01:46:36,369
We'll sit and talk.

1228
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:39,019
Tell me.

1229
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,709
Sir, let's get a journalist.

1230
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:45,659
- Okay...
- A journalist.

1231
01:46:45,859 --> 01:46:49,169
We'll ask them to write
an article about Mr. Petkar.

1232
01:46:50,089 --> 01:46:52,629
If it's true, you'll get credit.

1233
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:56,209
If it's not,
the reporter will be at fault.

1234
01:46:56,289 --> 01:46:58,379
Very simple. Am I right?

1235
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:01,189
Thank you.

1236
01:47:01,559 --> 01:47:03,909
Sir, think carefully. He's a swine.

1237
01:47:05,469 --> 01:47:06,689
Mind your tongue!

1238
01:47:06,849 --> 01:47:08,069
- What?
- Yes.

1239
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,579
Hello, Mr. Petkar.

1240
01:47:29,309 --> 01:47:31,199
What are you doing here?

1241
01:47:31,489 --> 01:47:33,089
You never returned.

1242
01:47:33,169 --> 01:47:35,449
Kamble sir was remembering you.

1243
01:47:35,589 --> 01:47:38,289
He has sent a noted reporter.

1244
01:47:38,499 --> 01:47:39,459
Hello.

1245
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,539
To hear your full story.

1246
01:47:42,859 --> 01:47:46,709
Tell sir, I don't want an award.

1247
01:47:47,869 --> 01:47:49,229
Don't want it?

1248
01:47:50,669 --> 01:47:53,619
Sir, a moment...

1249
01:47:55,289 --> 01:47:59,019
He didn't want the award for himself.
But, for our village.

1250
01:47:59,289 --> 01:48:01,239
For basic infrastructure.

1251
01:48:01,479 --> 01:48:03,829
Now, he's doing that too himself.

1252
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:05,669
He doesn't want it.

1253
01:48:11,099 --> 01:48:12,969
And he was making the road?

1254
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:16,579
Yes. Along with the villagers.

1255
01:48:16,659 --> 01:48:17,509
Okay.

1256
01:48:17,779 --> 01:48:20,879
Madam, he doesn't want the Arjuna Award.

1257
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:22,589
Not anymore.

1258
01:48:23,189 --> 01:48:26,189
- He doesn't want the Arjuna Award?
- No, madam.

1259
01:48:30,909 --> 01:48:32,009
Will you do one thing?

1260
01:48:33,299 --> 01:48:34,789
Murlikant Petkar.

1261
01:48:35,029 --> 01:48:38,589
You've matched the best timing
of the Commonwealth Games.

1262
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:39,889
Congratulations!

1263
01:48:40,119 --> 01:48:42,099
It's very impressive.

1264
01:48:43,069 --> 01:48:48,439
It also makes you eligible
for the Paralympics but...

1265
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:51,679
I am sorry, Murli.

1266
01:48:52,289 --> 01:48:54,869
The Indian Olympic committee has decided

1267
01:48:54,969 --> 01:48:59,949
no one will represent India
in swimming this time.

1268
01:49:01,929 --> 01:49:04,789
But sir, if the timing matches, what's--

1269
01:49:04,869 --> 01:49:08,019
Matching the best timing
at the Commonwealth Games

1270
01:49:08,189 --> 01:49:11,089
and winning the Paralympics
are very different.

1271
01:49:11,239 --> 01:49:16,179
Know the Paralympic record
for 50m freestyle?

1272
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:18,289
37.90 seconds.

1273
01:49:18,589 --> 01:49:22,039
And Commonwealth Games
is 39.85 seconds.

1274
01:49:22,219 --> 01:49:24,919
These two seconds mean

1275
01:49:24,999 --> 01:49:29,529
there are globally at least 15 swimmers
faster than Murlikant.

1276
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:31,859
If you want to win at the Paralympics,

1277
01:49:32,019 --> 01:49:35,029
you have to beat
the world's best swimmers.

1278
01:49:35,339 --> 01:49:37,529
Which is impossible.

1279
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:42,589
Murli, we fought a war
against Pakistan a year ago.

1280
01:49:43,709 --> 01:49:45,719
The country's treasury is empty.

1281
01:49:45,799 --> 01:49:52,109
With the little allocated to sport,
we've been asked to spend carefully

1282
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:54,679
on regular Olympic athletes.

1283
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,669
So, Paralympics aren't worthy for you.

1284
01:50:02,739 --> 01:50:06,039
It's neither the regular Olympics,

1285
01:50:06,829 --> 01:50:08,509
nor with regular athletes.

1286
01:50:08,589 --> 01:50:10,599
They can't even walk.

1287
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:12,939
Why waste money on them?

1288
01:50:13,089 --> 01:50:14,469
Murli, it's not that...

1289
01:50:14,549 --> 01:50:15,959
It is!

1290
01:50:16,369 --> 01:50:20,249
We're here for society to pity on.

1291
01:50:20,929 --> 01:50:22,249
Isn't it?

1292
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:25,849
If we perform spectacularly,

1293
01:50:27,619 --> 01:50:29,689
who will society pity?

1294
01:50:29,769 --> 01:50:37,119
No one considers a man fighting life
on his own accord.

1295
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:39,479
No!

1296
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:44,929
He must be constantly reminded
of what's being done for him

1297
01:50:45,079 --> 01:50:47,249
even though he's not regular.

1298
01:50:50,209 --> 01:50:52,759
We are regular people, sir.

1299
01:50:55,569 --> 01:50:57,169
With regular hope

1300
01:50:57,769 --> 01:50:59,439
and regular passion.

1301
01:51:00,089 --> 01:51:01,779
And regular strength.

1302
01:51:05,999 --> 01:51:10,759
Only your outlook isn't regular.

1303
01:51:18,529 --> 01:51:19,719
Murli...

1304
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:35,339
You talk of war to this man? Him!

1305
01:51:36,579 --> 01:51:39,609
He lost both legs in the '65 war.

1306
01:51:39,869 --> 01:51:44,999
Now, you steal his dream
by making the '71 war an excuse?

1307
01:51:45,649 --> 01:51:46,939
Really?

1308
01:51:47,489 --> 01:51:50,559
Such a prestigious post
and such shallow thinking.

1309
01:52:06,499 --> 01:52:09,079
Comrade, how's your revolution?

1310
01:52:10,699 --> 01:52:12,789
It will happen one day.

1311
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,349
All the best.

1312
01:52:14,859 --> 01:52:17,389
Tell me, how can I help?

1313
01:52:17,469 --> 01:52:20,379
Still posted at Secunderabad EME?

1314
01:52:20,459 --> 01:52:23,539
Yes, two more months. Need anything?

1315
01:52:23,849 --> 01:52:26,449
I wanted the details of an old soldier.

1316
01:52:27,229 --> 01:52:29,519
Please look into your old records.

1317
01:52:30,149 --> 01:52:32,169
A very interesting man...

1318
01:52:32,249 --> 01:52:34,549
if he's telling the truth.

1319
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:36,369
When was he posted here?

1320
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:38,939
Around 1964.

1321
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:40,179
50 years ago?

1322
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,259
They won't be in the computer records.

1323
01:52:43,349 --> 01:52:44,389
Oh!

1324
01:52:44,559 --> 01:52:47,499
Send me the details.
I'll go to the filing room.

1325
01:52:47,809 --> 01:52:49,449
Thanks. Right away.

1326
01:53:11,379 --> 01:53:13,019
I'll call back.

1327
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:16,849
Yes, Major.

1328
01:53:16,929 --> 01:53:19,009
I found Murlikant Petkar's file.

1329
01:53:19,219 --> 01:53:23,619
It has so much more
than what you sent.

1330
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:25,979
Even I'm shocked.

1331
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:28,999
In fact, I'll take this file
to the Army headquarters.

1332
01:53:29,079 --> 01:53:32,029
Headquarters? What's in it?

1333
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:38,709
Murli!

1334
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:40,899
Murli!

1335
01:53:40,979 --> 01:53:42,179
Where's Murli?

1336
01:53:43,549 --> 01:53:44,749
What happened?

1337
01:54:08,499 --> 01:54:11,929
Mr. Murlikant Rajaram Petkar,

1338
01:54:12,379 --> 01:54:16,889
the Indian Olympic Committee
has unanimously decided

1339
01:54:16,969 --> 01:54:27,529
for the 4th Paralympics being held
in Munich, West Germany in August 1972...

1340
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:38,139
You will represent India in swimming!

1341
01:54:38,219 --> 01:54:39,779
Yay!

1342
01:55:38,089 --> 01:55:39,239
Chhotu,

1343
01:55:40,829 --> 01:55:43,809
- where are you going so late?
- I woke up, sir.

1344
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:46,159
It's 8 am in Bombay.

1345
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:47,959
Up for a walk?

1346
01:55:48,329 --> 01:55:50,749
It's 4:30 am here.

1347
01:56:43,619 --> 01:56:45,429
Why isn't this in our records?

1348
01:56:45,759 --> 01:56:49,429
Sir, all sports records before 1980
are in the old files.

1349
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:51,239
These were archived, too.

1350
01:56:51,319 --> 01:56:56,089
Confirm Petkar's details with the
German Olympic Committee immediately.

1351
01:56:56,209 --> 01:56:56,909
Sir.

1352
01:57:49,579 --> 01:57:51,319
Murli!

1353
01:57:52,849 --> 01:57:54,019
Are you okay?

1354
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:57,219
What's happening, sir?

1355
01:57:57,529 --> 01:57:59,019
A terrorist attack.

1356
01:57:59,549 --> 01:58:01,849
Some dead and some are held hostage.

1357
01:58:02,869 --> 01:58:03,829
Let's go.

1358
01:58:04,399 --> 01:58:06,999
<i>They've now said,</i>
<i>there were 11 hostages.</i>

1359
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:10,759
<i>Two were killed</i>
<i>in their rooms yesterday morning.</i>

1360
01:58:10,839 --> 01:58:14,619
<i>Nine were killed at the airport tonight.</i>

1361
01:58:14,799 --> 01:58:18,649
<i>The games of the 20th Olympiad</i>
<i>have now been officially suspended.</i>

1362
01:58:20,649 --> 01:58:23,279
<i>Tomorrow morning</i>
<i>in the huge Olympic stadium</i>

1363
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:25,729
<i>there will be a memorial service--</i>

1364
01:58:25,809 --> 01:58:27,199
What did he say?

1365
01:58:30,879 --> 01:58:32,979
The Olympics have been cancelled.

1366
01:58:32,979 --> 01:58:34,969
11 athletes are dead.

1367
01:58:42,589 --> 01:58:43,519
Yes?

1368
01:58:43,719 --> 01:58:48,019
The German Olympic committee said
the Olympics were paused

1369
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:51,549
due to the terrorist attack
in Munich that year.

1370
01:58:51,709 --> 01:58:55,679
The Paralympics were shifted
to Heidelberg.

1371
01:58:56,079 --> 01:59:01,049
Whatever Petkar achieved at Heidelberg...
there's no record in India.

1372
02:00:06,019 --> 02:00:11,909
<i>In lane 4, the world record holder</i>
<i>from Poland Andrzej Seremak.</i>

1373
02:00:14,149 --> 02:00:17,519
<i>In lane 5 is the Commonwealth champion,</i>
<i>Andrew Nicholls.</i>

1374
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,719
<i>India's only swimming contestant,</i>
<i>Murlikant Petkar.</i>

1375
02:00:21,939 --> 02:00:26,869
There are six contestants in this race
with better timing than yours.

1376
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:31,459
You must be in the top 4
to move to the next round.

1377
02:00:32,019 --> 02:00:33,039
Got it?

1378
02:00:33,939 --> 02:00:36,359
<i>Murli brother.</i>

1379
02:00:47,369 --> 02:00:48,709
Take your marks.

1380
02:00:56,409 --> 02:00:59,419
<i>First heat of the mens 50m freestyle.</i>

1381
02:01:05,349 --> 02:01:08,649
<i>Murlikant has a bad start.</i>
<i>He's in the last position.</i>

1382
02:01:09,449 --> 02:01:13,289
<i>Belgium's Jespers leads,</i>
<i>leaving Poland's Seremak behind.</i>

1383
02:01:14,619 --> 02:01:17,449
<i>Swimmers cross the half mark.</i>

1384
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:20,689
<i>Murlikant in the 6th position.</i>

1385
02:01:20,769 --> 02:01:24,779
<i>He must catch up</i>
<i>to qualify for the next heat.</i>

1386
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:28,359
<i>Make it to the top 4.</i>

1387
02:01:29,429 --> 02:01:33,079
<i>It seems India is set to lose</i>
<i>in swimming again.</i>

1388
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:41,259
<i>Murlikant suddenly picks up speed</i>
<i>changing the board.</i>

1389
02:01:43,249 --> 02:01:46,979
<i>Petkar in 5th position,</i>
<i>leaving France's Bocquet behind.</i>

1390
02:01:47,849 --> 02:01:53,029
<i>Nearing the finish,</i>
<i>Murlikant in 4th, far from Roger Bates.</i>

1391
02:01:53,169 --> 02:01:55,649
<i>Murlikant gives it his all.</i>

1392
02:01:59,829 --> 02:02:01,879
<i>Murlikant catches up with Bates.</i>

1393
02:02:01,959 --> 02:02:04,819
<i>His every stroke bringing them closer.</i>

1394
02:02:06,529 --> 02:02:09,169
<i>Murlikant behind by one stroke.</i>

1395
02:02:12,209 --> 02:02:14,729
<i>Murlikant and Bates now neck and neck!</i>

1396
02:02:20,859 --> 02:02:22,369
<i>A photo finish!</i>

1397
02:02:22,509 --> 02:02:26,909
<i>Murlikant gave his best but</i>
<i>may have taken a bit longer.</i>

1398
02:02:29,649 --> 02:02:31,159
<i>Positions revealed...</i>

1399
02:02:31,399 --> 02:02:33,869
<i>Seremak is first, Nicholls second</i>

1400
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:35,649
<i>and Jespers is third.</i>

1401
02:02:35,939 --> 02:02:37,679
<i>Awaiting the 4th position.</i>

1402
02:02:37,759 --> 02:02:39,259
<i>Who makes it to the next heat?</i>

1403
02:02:39,339 --> 02:02:42,419
<i>England's Bates</i>
<i>or India's Murlikant Petkar?</i>

1404
02:02:45,609 --> 02:02:47,279
<i>Hearts are racing.</i>

1405
02:02:50,909 --> 02:02:52,379
Murlikant Petkar!

1406
02:02:52,549 --> 02:02:57,709
<i>India's young swimmer</i>
<i>has qualified for the next heat.</i>

1407
02:03:16,539 --> 02:03:20,659
<i>An unbelievable story.</i>

1408
02:03:21,879 --> 02:03:25,479
<i>But one that must be told.</i>

1409
02:03:27,819 --> 02:03:30,779
<i>Murlikant Rajaram Petkar.</i>

1410
02:03:32,709 --> 02:03:34,969
<i>The story of a man</i>

1411
02:03:35,049 --> 02:03:37,109
<i>who was nameless</i>

1412
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:40,149
<i>and went back into the shadows.</i>

1413
02:03:40,449 --> 02:03:45,329
<i>After 50 years,</i>
<i>it's important to tell this story.</i>

1414
02:03:45,959 --> 02:03:48,409
<i>For it to reach you.</i>

1415
02:03:48,669 --> 02:03:51,009
<i>Who is Murlikant Petkar?</i>

1416
02:03:51,419 --> 02:03:53,249
<i>And what is he made of?</i>

1417
02:03:56,499 --> 02:03:57,719
<i>The second heat starts.</i>

1418
02:03:57,989 --> 02:04:02,269
<i>Murlikant has a better start.</i>
<i>He is in 5th position.</i>

1419
02:04:02,449 --> 02:04:05,069
<i>Murlikant leaves</i>
<i>Belgium's Jespers behind</i>

1420
02:04:05,149 --> 02:04:07,869
<i>but New Zealand's Nicholls,</i>
<i>still ahead of both.</i>

1421
02:04:07,949 --> 02:04:11,629
<i>The first three swimmers</i>
<i>will go into the Finals.</i>

1422
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:14,059
<i>Murlikant in 4th place.</i>

1423
02:04:14,339 --> 02:04:16,689
<i>Jespers giving him tough competition.</i>

1424
02:04:17,989 --> 02:04:19,509
<i>Murlikant picks up speed</i>

1425
02:04:19,589 --> 02:04:21,679
<i>leaving Nicholls behind.</i>

1426
02:04:21,759 --> 02:04:23,669
<i>Murlikant now in 3rd place.</i>

1427
02:04:23,809 --> 02:04:27,229
<i>Petkar faces a tough fight from</i>
<i>New Zealand and Belgium.</i>

1428
02:04:27,309 --> 02:04:29,509
<i>Can Petkar qualify for the Finals?</i>

1429
02:04:40,859 --> 02:04:43,359
<i>Poland's Seremak in first position.</i>

1430
02:04:43,529 --> 02:04:45,339
<i>West Germany in second</i>

1431
02:04:45,419 --> 02:04:48,439
<i>and India's Murlikant Petkar in 3rd position</i>

1432
02:04:48,519 --> 02:04:50,879
<i>confirming his place in the Finals.</i>

1433
02:04:58,909 --> 02:05:01,009
Switch off the alarm.

1434
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:04,429
Chhotu.

1435
02:05:09,409 --> 02:05:11,409
He's fast asleep.

1436
02:05:17,529 --> 02:05:19,239
Come on. It's race day.

1437
02:05:19,919 --> 02:05:20,969
Wake up.

1438
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:24,129
Chhotu?

1439
02:05:25,899 --> 02:05:29,009
Wake up.
How much will you sleep?

1440
02:05:31,009 --> 02:05:32,369
Chhotu.

1441
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:40,689
Chhotu.

1442
02:05:41,749 --> 02:05:42,899
Chhotu?

1443
02:05:43,819 --> 02:05:45,099
Murli?

1444
02:05:55,939 --> 02:05:57,239
What happened, sir?

1445
02:05:57,879 --> 02:05:59,449
You were unconscious.

1446
02:06:01,659 --> 02:06:04,289
What's happened?

1447
02:06:05,949 --> 02:06:06,859
What happened?

1448
02:06:07,479 --> 02:06:09,089
I'm fine, sir.

1449
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:12,789
Where did this blood come from?

1450
02:06:13,829 --> 02:06:15,339
What happened?

1451
02:06:16,499 --> 02:06:19,509
I fell the other day...

1452
02:06:20,599 --> 02:06:23,859
hurt myself a little.

1453
02:06:25,349 --> 02:06:26,539
Where?

1454
02:06:26,619 --> 02:06:27,879
On the head, sir.

1455
02:06:27,959 --> 02:06:29,419
Where on the head?

1456
02:06:31,619 --> 02:06:33,129
Ali sir, I'm fine.

1457
02:06:34,579 --> 02:06:36,889
Isn't it where you got hit by a bullet?

1458
02:06:36,969 --> 02:06:38,789
Your skull fracture.

1459
02:06:38,959 --> 02:06:40,149
Your injury has opened.

1460
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:42,329
Get ready.
We have to go to the doctor.

1461
02:06:42,409 --> 02:06:43,749
Let it be, sir.

1462
02:06:45,389 --> 02:06:48,829
Why don't you get it, idiot?

1463
02:06:49,459 --> 02:06:51,889
If you hit the edge of the pool
even slightly,

1464
02:06:51,969 --> 02:06:53,609
know what will happen?

1465
02:06:54,569 --> 02:06:56,679
- Nothing will happen, sir.
- You'll die!

1466
02:06:56,759 --> 02:06:58,429
I won't die, sir!

1467
02:06:58,959 --> 02:07:01,659
If I enter the pool, I may die

1468
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:06,219
but if I don't swim today
with all my might, I'll surely die.

1469
02:07:17,109 --> 02:07:22,699
Ali sir, every player here
has repeatedly heard,

1470
02:07:23,289 --> 02:07:25,889
"You can't do this and that."

1471
02:07:27,069 --> 02:07:29,169
But they turned a deaf ear.

1472
02:07:29,479 --> 02:07:32,199
That's why they're here.
And so am I.

1473
02:07:35,109 --> 02:07:39,399
Ever since my childhood I was told,
"You're no good."

1474
02:07:41,289 --> 02:07:44,079
You're not a champion.
You're a loser.

1475
02:07:46,869 --> 02:07:49,069
They made fun of me in my village.

1476
02:07:51,919 --> 02:07:55,389
Chandu Champion. Loser champion!

1477
02:08:00,999 --> 02:08:02,909
I want to fight today.

1478
02:08:04,099 --> 02:08:07,589
For every loser who wanted
to become a champion.

1479
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:11,279
For every loser
who can become a champion.

1480
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:20,589
You had said,
"Winning isn't defeating your opponent."

1481
02:08:23,559 --> 02:08:26,299
True winning is silencing that voice

1482
02:08:26,729 --> 02:08:29,869
that says you've lost... without trying.

1483
02:08:35,569 --> 02:08:38,149
I must win over that voice.

1484
02:08:39,369 --> 02:08:41,259
I also must.

1485
02:08:49,509 --> 02:08:51,759
<i>Now, for the sports news.</i>

1486
02:08:52,299 --> 02:08:55,049
<i>In the 4th Paralympics in West Germany,</i>

1487
02:08:55,139 --> 02:08:58,969
<i>India's Murlikant Petkar will swim</i>
<i>in the Finals.</i>

1488
02:08:59,759 --> 02:09:05,049
<i>It is the first time in Olympic history,</i>
<i>an Indian swimmer has reached the Finals.</i>

1489
02:09:05,509 --> 02:09:09,009
<i>Murlikant Petkar is from Sangli,</i>
<i>Maharashtra.</i>

1490
02:09:09,349 --> 02:09:11,719
<i>Murli has been a part of the EME</i>

1491
02:09:11,799 --> 02:09:15,549
<i>and represented the Indian Army</i>
<i>in boxing.</i>

1492
02:09:16,179 --> 02:09:17,759
<i>In the 1965 war</i>

1493
02:09:17,799 --> 02:09:19,719
<i>he was posted in Kashmir.</i>

1494
02:09:27,799 --> 02:09:31,759
Our Murli! Ma...

1495
02:09:31,879 --> 02:09:34,799
Move out of the way.

1496
02:09:37,719 --> 02:09:40,639
Ma!

1497
02:09:41,429 --> 02:09:42,759
What happened?

1498
02:09:42,849 --> 02:09:44,429
Why are you crying?

1499
02:09:44,849 --> 02:09:45,969
Murli...

1500
02:09:46,349 --> 02:09:48,549
What happened to Murli?

1501
02:09:48,759 --> 02:09:49,759
Mother...

1502
02:09:49,889 --> 02:09:51,549
What is it?

1503
02:09:51,759 --> 02:09:53,389
What happened to Murli?

1504
02:09:53,759 --> 02:09:55,639
Tell me. What happened to him?

1505
02:09:55,719 --> 02:09:57,849
Murli has reached...

1506
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:00,009
Where?

1507
02:10:00,219 --> 02:10:02,969
- Murli has reached the Olympics.
- What?

1508
02:10:03,049 --> 02:10:06,049
Yes. Olympics!

1509
02:10:06,759 --> 02:10:08,179
Olympics!

1510
02:10:11,759 --> 02:10:12,969
Yes.

1511
02:10:13,349 --> 02:10:15,719
- The Olympics, Ma!
- Really?

1512
02:10:15,889 --> 02:10:20,799
Yes, I heard it on the radio.
At the shop with father...

1513
02:10:21,639 --> 02:10:28,599
Our Murli has reached the Olympics, Ma.

1514
02:10:41,799 --> 02:10:48,259
<i>For the first time in Olympic history,</i>
<i>an Indian has reached the swimming Finals.</i>

1515
02:10:48,929 --> 02:10:52,679
<i>Murlikant Petkar is at the brink</i>
<i>of making history.</i>

1516
02:10:52,759 --> 02:10:53,889
Sit!

1517
02:10:54,009 --> 02:10:57,889
<i>He competes</i>
<i>with the world's best swimmers.</i>

1518
02:11:01,969 --> 02:11:03,389
<i>Take your marks.</i>

1519
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:14,679
<i>The Final 50m freestyle race begins.</i>

1520
02:11:17,179 --> 02:11:20,349
<i>Murlikant has a poor start.</i>
<i>He's in 6th position.</i>

1521
02:11:21,049 --> 02:11:25,099
<i>Murlikant falling short</i>
<i>amongst the best swimmers.</i>

1522
02:11:30,759 --> 02:11:33,259
<i>Hey, loser champion!</i>

1523
02:12:10,299 --> 02:12:14,179
<i>The boxer from India has been defeated.</i>

1524
02:12:47,509 --> 02:12:50,179
<i>Murlikant Petkar picks up speed</i>

1525
02:12:51,429 --> 02:12:54,389
<i>leaving America's Robert behind.</i>

1526
02:12:54,469 --> 02:12:55,969
<i>Murlikant is in 4th position.</i>

1527
02:12:56,429 --> 02:12:59,259
<i>It's the day Murlikant's been waiting for.</i>

1528
02:12:59,349 --> 02:13:01,639
<i>He gives it his all.</i>

1529
02:13:03,849 --> 02:13:06,639
<i>Racing ahead of New Zealand's Nicholls,</i>

1530
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,219
<i>Petkar's takes 3rd position.</i>

1531
02:13:13,009 --> 02:13:17,009
<i>Murlikant in 2nd position,</i>
<i>leaving Olbrich behind.</i>

1532
02:13:19,799 --> 02:13:22,219
<i>Who would've thought an Indian swimmer</i>

1533
02:13:22,299 --> 02:13:26,259
<i>would give world champion, Seremak,</i>
<i>a run for the Gold.</i>

1534
02:13:29,469 --> 02:13:31,679
<i>A few seconds for the race to end.</i>

1535
02:13:31,759 --> 02:13:35,009
<i>Murlikant picks up speed with every stroke.</i>

1536
02:13:37,509 --> 02:13:39,509
Come on.

1537
02:13:40,009 --> 02:13:42,679
<i>Murlikant neck and neck with Seremak.</i>

1538
02:13:51,889 --> 02:13:53,179
<i>And over!</i>

1539
02:13:53,259 --> 02:13:54,929
<i>History has been made!</i>

1540
02:13:55,009 --> 02:13:58,889
<i>India wins its first</i>
<i>individual Gold medal.</i>

1541
02:13:59,049 --> 02:14:02,549
<i>And the man's name is Murlikant Petkar.</i>

1542
02:14:02,759 --> 02:14:05,849
<i>A historic day for Indian sport.</i>

1543
02:14:06,469 --> 02:14:08,429
It's a new world record!

1544
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:14,099
Murlikant Petkar has broken the world record
in 50m freestyle.

1545
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:34,799
Come on Murli brother.

1546
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:18,549
<i>With a new world record timing of 37.33 seconds.</i>

1547
02:15:19,049 --> 02:15:23,599
<i>The gold medal goes to Murlikant Petkar of India.</i>

1548
02:15:58,099 --> 02:16:01,509
<i>That day Murlikant Petkar's dream came true.</i>

1549
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:04,349
<i>However, this unbelievable story</i>

1550
02:16:04,759 --> 02:16:07,429
<i>was lost in the sands of time.</i>

1551
02:16:08,929 --> 02:16:11,719
<i>But, it's important to take</i>
<i>the dust off the story</i>

1552
02:16:12,759 --> 02:16:17,549
<i>for Murli's story to get it's due in history.</i>

1553
02:16:20,049 --> 02:16:21,259
Murlikant sir.

1554
02:16:21,389 --> 02:16:22,799
I'm Vishwas Patil.

1555
02:16:23,009 --> 02:16:25,679
Additional Secretary
in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

1556
02:16:25,849 --> 02:16:28,139
You wanted to apply for the Arjuna Award,

1557
02:16:28,219 --> 02:16:32,259
but the Government of India doesn't want
to give you that award.

1558
02:16:34,099 --> 02:16:39,469
You deserve a bigger award
for what you've done for this country...

1559
02:16:40,509 --> 02:16:44,259
The President of India wants to honor you
with the Padmashri.

1560
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:46,139
- Padmashri?
- Yes.

1561
02:16:47,969 --> 02:16:49,099
Dad...

1562
02:17:03,889 --> 02:17:08,009
<i>Murlikant Petkar's story</i>
<i>is the story of free India.</i>

1563
02:17:08,929 --> 02:17:11,389
<i>The year of liberation - 1947.</i>

1564
02:17:12,299 --> 02:17:15,639
<i>Circumstances were such</i>

1565
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:17,679
<i>Could the country even survive?</i>

1566
02:17:18,009 --> 02:17:20,139
<i>The destination seemed unattainable,</i>

1567
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:25,599
<i>but India fights with determination...</i>
<i>against all odds.</i>

1568
02:17:26,049 --> 02:17:28,599
<i>Similarly, Murlikant fights,</i>

1569
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:31,849
<i>against all odds.</i>

1570
02:17:32,679 --> 02:17:36,599
<i>India wouldn't accept defeat,</i>
<i>nor would Murlikant.</i>

1571
02:17:36,679 --> 02:17:39,509
<i>Both had a dream</i>

1572
02:17:40,259 --> 02:17:43,679
<i>to achieve something</i>
<i>and prove themselves</i>

1573
02:17:44,049 --> 02:17:51,299
<i>remove all doubt, every question</i>
<i>and counter every ridicule</i>

1574
02:17:51,969 --> 02:17:53,469
<i>by turning around and saying,</i>

1575
02:17:54,299 --> 02:17:56,469
<i>"Hey, what are you laughing about?"</i>
