Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 1 8 years ago.

to hear a thing twice.

164
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,127
And l've never known you
to hide from the truth.

165
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
You've come to lecture me on truth?

166
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
l've come to tell you that what l saw...

167
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,299
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

168
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,471
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

169
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,515
They won't be able to resist us now.

170
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,225
Soon l shall be sitting on the lron Throne.

171
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,727
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the lron...

172
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,437
l'll hear no more about it.

173
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,864
MAN: Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

174
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,909
When do we sail for King's Landing?

175
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
As soon as l've consolidated my troops.

176
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,205
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

177
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,499
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

178
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,752
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

179
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,880
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

180
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,175
That's not your concern.

181
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,804
lf you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

182
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
l never thought l'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was l wrong?

183
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

184
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,186
Oh, truth again.

185
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,689
All right, what's the truth?

186
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
The hard truth?

187
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,446
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

188
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,575
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

189
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,371
What do you believe?

190
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,919
You won those bannermen from Renly.

191
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,547
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,305
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,851
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
Your Grace, l'm honored,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,483
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

196
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,151
The other lords won't be happy.

197
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,237
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,573
l don't hang them for treason.

199
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,745
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

200
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,723
GlRL: l've got it! l've got it!

201
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,059
MAN: So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

202
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,563
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

203
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,150
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

204
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,735
What do we have?

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,446
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

206
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,991
Well, l've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

207
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,452
Good thing. l'd be out of a job.

208
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,621
What about your father?

209
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

210
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,918
He's very busy.

211
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,922
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

212
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

213
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,801
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

214
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
MAN: Corruption.
CROWD: Yes!

215
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,641
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

216
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,019
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

217
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,439
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

218
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,607
(CHEERlNG)

219
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,485
Yes, a rotten king.

220
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,446
lt's hard to argue with his assessment.

221
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,740
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

222
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,660
The king is a lost cause.

223
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,079
lt's the rest of us l'm worried about now.

224
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,833
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

225
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,503
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

226
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,796
(LAUGHlNG)

227
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,674
You have to admire his imagination.

228
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
He's talking about you.

229
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,929
What? Demon monkey?

230
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,348
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

231
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,559
They blame you for the city's ills.

232
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,936
Blame me? l'm trying to save them.

233
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,272
You don't need to convince me.

234
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,525
Demon monkey.

235
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,176
(MEN LAUGHlNG)

236
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
Yeah, come on.

237
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,224
THEON: You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

238
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,770
l'm your commander. Welcome.

239
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,607
Stop.

240
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
Stop!

241
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,154
Your captain commands you to stop!

242
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,282
Where are we headed, Captain?

243
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,329
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

244
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,874
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do yourjobs well.

245
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,086
And who decides if we've done ourjobs well?

246
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,255
l do.

247
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,424
Your captain.

248
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,510
(ALL LAUGHlNG)

249
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,599
l have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

250
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,604
Don't reckon l've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

251
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,899
Don't reckon l've got much use
for a captain at all.

252
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,986
l'm thinking l can do the job of captain
real well myself.

253
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,239
All l need is a ship.

254
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,119
You wouldn't know where l could
find myself a ship now, would you?

255
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,918
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

256
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,839
And l will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

257
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,466
Stop. We yield.

258
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,973
Congratulations on your first command.

259
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,684
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

260
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,977
Oh, l'm not here for you.

261
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,397
l was just on my way to Red Harbor.

262
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,109
l've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

263
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
Too narrow.

264
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,114
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

265
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,408
That would never happen.

266
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,953
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if l asked them to.

267
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,372
This lot, though...

268
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,209
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

269
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,675
Come on, l'll take you out.

270
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,761
Who are you?

271
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,846
Dagmer, your first mate.

272
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,266
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

273
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,103
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

274
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,480
That would be good for a laugh.

275
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,608
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

276
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,861
And how am l supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

277
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,362
You're not.

278
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,202
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that l'm a true lron lslander.

279
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,996
They're all lron lslanders.

280
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,625
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

281
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,843
THEON: The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

282
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,262
The seat of the House of Tallhart,

283
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,770
-What, you don't think we could take it?
-No, we could.

284
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,939
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

285
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,316
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

286
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,444
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

287
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,279
And then...

288
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,330
Take me to my ship.

289
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,004
The Starks have overextended their lines.

290
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,923
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

291
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
keeping their men and horses fed.

292
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,010
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

293
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,929
The cold won't beat them.

294
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,725
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

295
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,272
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

296
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,108
And l'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

297
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,152
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

298
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,780
This is war, no one's content.

299
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,327
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

300
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,956
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

301
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,627
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

302
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,213
You've been waiting for him to fail.

303
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,259
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

304
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,848
So how do we stop him?

305
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,766
REGlNALD: We've worked
through the night, my lord.

306
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,644
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

307
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,688
Yes, l think you would, Reginald.

308
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,483
And because you're my cousin,
l might even let you wake from that sleep.

309
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,112
Go, l'm sure your wife must miss you.

310
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,031
My wife's in Lannisport.

311
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,158
Well, then you'd better start riding.

312
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,996
Go, before l change my mind
and send her your head.

313
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,123
lf your name wasn't Lannister,

314
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,835
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

315
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,840
Not wine, water.

316
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,842
We'll be here for some time.

317
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Girl.

Maidenpool, my lord.

320

And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

321
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,945
House Mooton, my lord.

322
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,738
And what is their sigil?

323
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,119
A red salmon.

324
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,872
l think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

325

You're a Northerner, aren't you?

326

Good. One more time, where are you from?

327
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
Barrowton, my lord.

328
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,592
House Dustin.

329
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,345
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

330
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,934
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

331
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,439
They call him the Young Wolf.

332
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,816
And?

333
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,194
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

334
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,534
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

335
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,577
They say he can't be killed.

And do you believe them?

337
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,583
No, my lord.

338
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
Anyone can be killed.

339
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,929
Fetch that water.

340

And only death may pay for life.

You saved me and the two l was with.

361

You stole three deaths from the Red God.

The one who tortures everyone.

My uncle told me stories about him.

00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,035
Most of them are true.

383
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,413
l heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

The whole winter.

385
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,250
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

386
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,211
Had to wait for the thaw.

387

So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

Well, possible for the Halfhand.

Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

Must not mean anything, then.

639
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,296
You're lying.

640
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,257
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

641
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,260
-You know what it means.
-l never said l didn't.

642
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,262
You didn't give me an honest answer.

643
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,015
That's not the same as being a liar.

644
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,725
Well, it's not far off.

645
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,270
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

646
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,984
ln the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

647
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,694
Now who's a liar?

648
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,491
What did you see in your dream?

649
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,913
Something bad?

650
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,624
Tell me, boy.

651
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
l dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

652
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,800
l saw waves crashing against the gates

653
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
and the water came flowing over the walls...

654
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,267
lt flooded the castle.

655
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,022
Drowned men were floating here,

656
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,107
in the yard.

657
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

658
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,368
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

659
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,661
l know.

660
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,122
-lt's just a stupid dream.
-l've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

661
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,250
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

662
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,918
Osha.

663
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,503
The three-eyed raven,

664
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,174
what do they say about it north of the Wall?

665
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,680
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

668
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,861
On that mountain.

SAMWELL: l don't see very well.

670

JON: A fire.

671
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,370
There's a fire.

672
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,082
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

673
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,711
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

674
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,381
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

675
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,466
How many wildlings have joined him?

676
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,553
From what we can tell, all of them.

677
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,477
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

678
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,229
They're almost ready to make their move.

679
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,066
-Where?
-Somewhere safe.

680
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,860
Somewhere south.

681
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,571
Can't just march into their midst.

682
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,491
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

683
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,578
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

684
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,831
Mance was one of us once.

685
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,584
Now he's one of them.

686
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,587
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

687
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,507
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

688
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,845
They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,

689
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,972
more like us.

690
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,268
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

691
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,688
Sneak in, kill Mance,

692
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,567
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

693
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,779
-And to do that...
-We need to get rid of those lookouts.

lt's not a job for 400 men.

He's the one?

704
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,184
Aye. You killed a wight.

705
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,772
You also let an old man beat you bloody

ln the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

709
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,158
l could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

710
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,453
lt would be no trouble.

Well, l hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

715

He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,363
He's my advisor,

l can almost always tell what a man wants.

And what about what a woman wants?

721

Much more complicated.

722
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,878
You, for example, what do you want?

723
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,715
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the lron Throne.

724
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,216
Why?

725
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,177
Because l promised my khalasar
l'd protect them

-and find them a safe home.

Did someone give it to you?

No. l come from nothing.
l hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

their weight in gold if they could break into it.

All? Let us say half.

More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

Enough to go home.

My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

760
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,624
But marry me,
and l will give you the Seven Kingdoms

will be princes and princesses.

To win Westeros,

The usurper is dead.

771

The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

772
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,377
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

773
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,505
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

774
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,216
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

777

Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

778

And if l'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

779
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,229
we'd all be dead by now.

780
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,483

seems like the last you'll ever have,

00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,070
-but you must...
-Do not speak to me like l'm a child.

Tell me.

-To see you on the lron Throne.
-Why?

785
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,623
You have a good claim.

786
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,917
A title. A birthright.

787
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
But you have something more than that.

788
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,217
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

789
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,470
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

790
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,432
Someone who can rule and should rule.

791
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,519
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

792
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,608
There are times when l look at you
and l still can't believe you're real.

793
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,915
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

Sideface?

806
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,070
Sideways.

807
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,447
Why?

00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,365
Smaller target.

809
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,411
Am l fighting someone?

810
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,746
You're practicing for a fight.

811
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,374

815
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

816
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,728
Go up the battlement.

817
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,696
Move away.

818
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,909
