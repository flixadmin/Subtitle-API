00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,749
This film is based on
a true story

2
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,495
names, characters, and events
have been dramatized

3
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,910
Seriously?

4
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,036
Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?

5
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,323
That's quite a dent.

6
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,705
Are you okay?

7
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,407
- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.

8
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,782
Why did you drive so fast
at night?

9
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,123
- How are the photos?
- Sorry?

10
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,240
There's really no need for that.

11
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,782
What are you talking about?

12
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,456
Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.

13
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,411
You had better not
change your story.

14
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,827
It's scratched...

15
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,114
Another murder took place
in a land development site

16
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,373
near cheonan early this morning.

17
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,454
Since last year, many murders
and missing person cases

18
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:25,114
have been reported all around
the south chungcheong province,

19
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,284
but the police
are yet to close the cases...

20
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,117
We want to close them too,
you know.

21
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,993
We want to close cases,

22
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,200
go on vacations,
and get promoted.

23
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,577
Turn off the siren!
(Download Movie just on Mkvking.com)

24
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,367
No one in this town
gives a damn.

25
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,124
They just couldn't care less.

26
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,620
- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.

27
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,540
Gosh, look at those thugs.

28
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,991
Trash like them should just die.

29
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,449
Where are you going?
We're on a case!

30
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,282
Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?

31
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,039
- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,241
- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.

33
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,452
Seriously.

34
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,518
Please be on your way.
Please go.

35
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,578
- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.

36
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,411
I told you
to stay out of my sight.

37
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,948
Block the entrance.

38
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,581
Step aside.

39
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,825
To what do we owe the pleasure
on this hot day?

40
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,947
Does a cop need permission
from thugs to be here?

41
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
Sir.

42
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,792
Come on, sir!

43
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:38,409
Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.

44
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,498
It must be one of those days.

45
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,249
The roads were jammed
but things aren't better here.

46
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,532
All right, fine.

47
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,579
Here. Now please go away.

48
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,326
You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?

49
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,033
How dare you try to bribe me?

50
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,866
Gameland

51
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,493
here you go, fucking jerks.

52
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,617
You guys should've
been more careful.

53
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,247
How dare gangsters
try to block a cop's way?

54
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,865
Please continue.

55
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,910
I hope you win!

56
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,958
Boss.

57
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,578
That fucking cop's here.

58
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,458
Put it down.

59
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,415
- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, boss.

60
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,199
I received 200,000 won
in gift certificates.

61
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,414
Our share is ten percent,

62
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,706
so your total is 180,000 won.

63
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,998
Who the fuck...

64
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,577
Open it.

65
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,333
Salute.

66
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,452
Whatever.

67
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,791
You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.

68
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,657
Remain silent

69
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,207
or retain a lawyer if you want.

70
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,827
You're coming with me.

71
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:55,284
Detective, why don't
you come in for a second?

72
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,582
Buddy, come out here.

73
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,032
Don't forget to put those on.

74
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,138
- Good morning, boss!
- Good morning, boss!

75
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,577
Yes, it's me.

76
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,994
That bastard"s back again.

77
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,202
What?

78
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,163
I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?

79
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,536
Ask the fucker yourself.

80
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,373
Tell sang-do I'm heading there.

81
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,825
You can't do this, not when you
receive our monthly fee.

82
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,248
Taking all the money
for yourself

83
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,165
has caused your boys
to disrupt my business.

84
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,409
I already advised you against
gift certificate conversion.

85
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,037
Start a currency exchange shop
under someone else's name,

86
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,287
or share the stakes. You know
what I'm talking about.

87
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,414
All that for some chump change?

88
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,162
I'm busy as it is
setting up new operations.

89
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,290
Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?

90
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,036
My boys need the money.

91
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,332
All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.

92
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,625
What?

93
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Are you kidding me?

94
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,999
I'm your superior, you know.
Where are you?

95
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,199
On my way to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.

96
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,164
I really don't like this guy.

97
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,410
Let me just turn off...

98
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,286
- The electric fan.
- Keep walking.

99
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,865
Stop right there.

100
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,410
As you wish.

101
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,036
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.

102
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,999
Seriously? Is this necessary?

103
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,367
I gave you a ride!

104
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,539
Here's my payment.

105
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,702
Now, kneel on the ground!

106
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,954
I'm going to report you.

107
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,782
Bloody traffic jam.

108
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,287
Where the heck have you been?

109
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,914
Gosh, there's a crowd already.

110
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,702
Get rid of them.

111
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,915
Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,413
You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?

113
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,000
Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?

114
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,616
Hey, move aside!

115
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,914
Stay back if you were late.

116
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,159
Don't head toward the bridge
and stay close.

117
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,864
I just received a call
requesting for backup.

118
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:56,827
Move back, please.

119
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,412
People are gathering over there!

120
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,740
We're gaining an audience!

121
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,039
Good day, officer.

122
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,823
Did you identify the victim?

123
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,408
We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.

124
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,657
He died only a few hours ago

125
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,453
between three and five
this morning.

126
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,329
Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing

127
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,908
or a heart attack.

128
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,456
That's my initial impression.

129
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,907
Hey, come and take some photos.

130
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,455
Did you get it?

131
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,199
Make sure
you don't miss anything.

132
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,453
Hey, seo-Jin. Over here!

133
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,912
Can you take a look at this?

134
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,579
I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.

135
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,707
My apologies, chief cha.
Anyway, please take a look.

136
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,077
What is it?

137
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,482
Looks like rear-end collision,
right?

138
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,583
It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.

139
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,873
Could this be the motive?

140
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,957
I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.

141
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,203
By the way, I should thank you

142
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,329
for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.

143
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,874
There are rules for a reason,
you know.

144
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,910
Whatever.

145
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,579
So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.

146
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Got it.

147
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,030
Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?

148
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,743
Let's be flexible about this.

149
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,741
- Sang-do.
- Yes?

150
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,909
If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.

151
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,532
Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.

152
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,540
Everyone has his limit.

153
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,953
If you cross the line,
you'll die.

154
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,870
Come on, do you really think so?

155
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,498
Guus hiddink once said this.

156
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,658
"I'm still fucking hungry."

157
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,115
I have no capital,
no connections,

158
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,454
so I'm still hungry.

159
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:42,917
Sir.

160
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,030
My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.

161
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,330
That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.

162
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,578
The slot arcade business

163
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,741
is nothing like fighting
over these bars and clubs!

164
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,199
Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?

165
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,874
Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!

166
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,573
Do you have a death wish?

167
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,038
Shut the fuck up!

168
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,491
Is this how you train your boys?

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,365
Look at him glaring at me.

170
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,243
Hey, dong-s...

171
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,078
Why are you
acting so high and mighty

172
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,767
when all you give me
are only the crumbs?

173
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,783
This type of transaction
won't keep the peace.

174
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,118
Come here.

175
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Yes, boss.

176
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,166
You shouldn't
interrupt our conversation.

177
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,708
Come here.

178
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,994
You little fucker.

179
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,414
There. Now we can work in peace.

180
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,910
Drink up.

181
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:23,997
It's good.

182
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,495
Cheonan police station

183
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,033
choe jeong-gyu, 46 years old.

184
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,000
No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.

185
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,698
The autopsy report was obvious.

186
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,452
He has over a dozen stab wounds.

187
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,268
The murderer is obviously
an amateur.

188
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,657
He just went nuts.

189
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,829
I don't feel comfortable
calling the culprit an amateur.

190
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,743
No evidence was left behind.

191
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,875
No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.

192
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,249
Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery.

193
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,289
However, the amount
is too small so...

194
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,491
People kill others
for the littlest things.

195
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,088
The meeting's over.
Get the captain of unit one.

196
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,917
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,542
I'm here, sir.

198
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,662
This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,

199
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,996
so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.

200
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,118
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,578
You guys, back up unit one.

202
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,607
Three separate cases,
but one killer.

203
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,535
What cases?

204
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,875
Listen.

205
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,655
A reservoir in seosan
on July 15,

206
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,367
boryeong sunbeach motel
on July 23,

207
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,574
and then last night's case.

208
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,283
A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.

209
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,786
Considering the length
and width of the knife,

210
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,744
it could be the same.

211
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,243
No, I'm certain it is.

212
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,198
The suspect is a serial killer.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,786
This isn't the usa, you know.

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.

215
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,157
That's nonsense.

216
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,537
There are over
1,000 murders a year.

217
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,366
Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.

218
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,493
Are you nuts?

219
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,534
Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?

220
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,617
Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?

221
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,284
If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.

222
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,869
He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.

223
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,244
He could strike again
at any time...

224
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,853
This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?

225
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,498
Murder cases aren't a joke.

226
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,268
You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!

227
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,292
That's not...

228
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,991
These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.

229
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,533
They each happened
about a week apart

230
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,037
all around
south chungcheong province.

231
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,068
No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.

232
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,215
Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

233
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,998
Screw your nonsense.

234
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,018
Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade

235
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,374
on your way to a crime scene?

236
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,657
Did you have the time do that?

237
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,540
Aren't they criminals too?

238
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,329
Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.

239
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,655
Jeong tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?

240
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,872
Hey.

241
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,228
Are you that desperate
to get promoted?

242
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,368
Gosh...

243
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,824
Yes, that's what I'm after.

244
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,740
It's why I want
to catch the killer.

245
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,700
The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.

246
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,366
I didn't drink, so I'll drive.

247
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,160
But, boss...

248
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,536
Take the boys and head back.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,080
Yes, boss.

250
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,703
That's correct, chairman.

251
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,447
Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.

252
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,907
He won't make trouble anymore.

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,865
Yes, don't worry.

254
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,911
Have a good night.

255
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,535
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,157
The road was slippery.

257
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,331
It looks fine. You can just go.

258
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,743
Sorry?

259
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,869
But I still hit your car.

260
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,615
It's fine. You can go.

261
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,660
Are you sure about that?

262
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,831
Yes, it's fine.

263
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,073
Son of a bitch!

264
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,157
Damn it!

265
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,705
What the hell?

266
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,490
Who are you?

267
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,910
Come back here!

268
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,743
You're all dead!

269
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,164
You assholes!

270
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,365
Who's there?

271
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,032
Sang-do didn't send him.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,581
I didn't recognize the attacker.

273
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,999
It was sang-do, boss.

274
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,039
He's not a member of a gang.

275
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,033
His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.

276
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,407
It felt different.

277
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,333
Who else would try to attack you

278
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,873
in our line of work?

279
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
Give me that.

280
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,206
It was too dark
to see properly but...

281
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,873
White sedan, daejeon 23xx

282
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,407
- get out!
- Locate the vehicle.

283
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,411
I told you to be careful,
didn't 1?

284
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,865
We're actually friends.

285
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,581
Gosh, sorry to bother you.

286
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,115
The patient looks
damn comfy to me.

287
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,368
Who are you?

288
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,414
I brought a box of red bulls.

289
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,784
Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.

290
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,328
The hospital
reported it to the police.

291
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,700
Well, you must be
quite embarrassed

292
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,948
to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.

293
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,870
It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.

294
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,119
Cops are so incompetent

295
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,124
that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.

296
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,330
Unbelievable.

297
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,707
Right, model citizen,
jang dong-su,

298
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,537
tell me everything
about last night.

299
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,956
I'll catch him for you.

300
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,328
I can probably catch him faster.

301
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,698
Really?

302
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,744
Jeez. Do you want to bet?

303
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,415
Spill it, asshole.

304
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,331
Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.

305
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,998
Fine. Do you mind?

306
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:06,036
I tripped last night
and hurt myself.

307
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,948
Right, okay.

308
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,703
You should really
watch your step.

309
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,747
Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.

310
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,322
Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?

311
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,702
Got it, I'll hang up.

312
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,407
Son of a bitch.

313
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,282
A rear-end collision.

314
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,578
White sedan.

315
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,790
I was right, shithead.

316
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,948
Wish you a fast recovery,
hur sang-do

317
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:54,030
Jeez, look at you.

318
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,368
Are you okay?

319
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,953
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

320
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,453
I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.

321
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,574
What will happen now?

322
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,200
You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.

323
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,831
What would you like me to do?

324
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,619
A lot of my boys
are cripples now.

325
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,115
Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.

326
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,907
And hand over the main store
and also the one in seongan.

327
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,453
I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.

328
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,042
And the shops?

329
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,123
Was this your plan all along?

330
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,122
Dong-su.

331
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,706
If I gave the order,

332
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,618
you wouldn't be alive.

333
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,369
Anyway, think about it.

334
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,248
I'm curious too, you know.

335
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,244
Who would mess you up like this?

336
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,327
See you then.

337
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,573
So fucking embarrassing!

338
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,159
A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!

339
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,659
Trust me and give me
two men on this case.

340
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,241
I'll catch that guy in one go.

341
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,995
Why don't you just
go on a vacation?

342
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,994
I barely have enough men
to run this department,

343
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,950
so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?

344
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,032
Chief, it's a huge case.

345
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,087
If you close one,
others will get solved as well.

346
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,958
It will be a long train
of solved cases.

347
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,660
Piss off!

348
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,489
We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.

349
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,615
Did a witness come forward?

350
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,493
Jang dong-s...

351
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,282
What? Jang dong-su?

352
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,869
He was stabbed a few days ago.

353
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,124
A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and...

354
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,288
Listen to yourself.

355
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,661
Just think about it
for a second.

356
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,242
What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?

357
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,699
The killer's not involved
with gangs.

358
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,249
I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!

359
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,333
Shut it!

360
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,742
This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to unit two.

361
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,412
I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.

362
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,413
Now, get out.

363
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,408
Go easy on covering for him.

364
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,324
This isn't the time for that.

365
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,365
What did you say?

366
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,787
It's what you've been doing.

367
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,623
You son of a bitch!

368
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,823
Let's say you're right.

369
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,782
But jang is the victim here.

370
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,828
You can't arrest a witness

371
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,873
for not reporting a crime.

372
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,698
How many crimes
has he committed?

373
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,283
We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.

374
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,494
He's pissed off
to say the least.

375
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,415
If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.

376
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,472
That'll leave us
with three unsolved cases.

377
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,456
How can jang find the killer?

378
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,664
He's a gangster, not a cop.

379
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,371
His men have the resources
to find someone in days.

380
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,789
Also, jang saw...

381
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,456
The killer's face.

382
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,708
Get out.

383
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,036
You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.

384
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:42,993
- Get out!
- Jeez.

385
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,037
Why don't you talk
to the landlord?

386
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,830
Jeez!

387
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,289
What am I supposed to do?

388
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,491
I need to work
in order to earn money!

389
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,286
What? Birthday?

390
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,698
How is that important right now?

391
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,782
I'm tired as hell!

392
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,410
I haven't slept in two days,

393
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,286
so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!

394
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,407
It must be your kid's birthday.

395
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:26,833
What?

396
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,494
That goddamn kid you mentioned.

397
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,618
Give me that.

398
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,873
Sharp face,

399
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,120
thin cheeks, an angled chin,

400
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,741
and a narrow and long nose.

401
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,499
His lips are big
compared to his nose.

402
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,573
That's pretty close.

403
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,407
Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.

404
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,623
It's not the kid's fault.

405
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,948
Find him before the cops.

406
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,456
I understand, boss.

407
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,743
Hey, where are we?

408
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,830
Wait. Who are you?

409
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,039
Block the door!

410
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,581
Don't let them come out!

411
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,366
Thank you for your cooperation.

412
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,905
We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.

413
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,374
All gamblers should stay put.

414
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,577
So where's the boss?

415
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,448
Get him down here!

416
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,286
Yeah? Hold on.

417
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,407
Okay, go ahead.

418
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,536
Jang dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.

419
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,532
He's a scheming bastard.

420
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,665
He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.

421
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,994
- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,

422
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,782
let me ask him.

423
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,699
So, should I request a warrant?

424
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,456
What do you want?

425
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,206
The one who stabbed you.

426
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,867
Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.

427
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,782
What if I don't?

428
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,123
Since you have my boss
on your side,

429
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,324
I'm no use to you, is that it?

430
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,449
Listen, jang dong-s...

431
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,948
The guy who stabbed you

432
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,698
is a serial killer.

433
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,703
He's a bit strange though.

434
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,282
He's different
from other psychos.

435
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,323
And you're the proof.

436
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,692
What the hell
are you talking about?

437
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,665
Why do you think
he messed with you?

438
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,746
Most psychopaths go after girls

439
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,809
or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.

440
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,698
But the killer
attacks just about anyone.

441
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,199
If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.

442
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,536
What the hell's your problem?

443
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,500
Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.

444
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,039
It's a win-win.

445
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,915
I'll catch him,
put him on trial,

446
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,831
and lock him up for good.

447
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:09,958
Then what?

448
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,706
Nothing. That's how it ends.

449
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,788
That's it?

450
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:21,156
When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built

451
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,662
on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,

452
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,454
this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building

453
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,375
will become the hottest spot
in town...

454
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,201
Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.

455
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,956
Damn it.

456
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,786
Everyone who lined up

457
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,411
for pre-construction units
have left.

458
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,739
Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.

459
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:50,330
Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.

460
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,541
The cheongju region
is another problem too.

461
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,697
Sang-do's boys are moving
into our turf.

462
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,193
What about the punk
who stabbed me?

463
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,165
We found his car

464
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,911
on the sintanjin-bound
national highway.

465
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,667
His car?

466
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,749
It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.

467
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,323
The boys found it.

468
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,159
- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.

469
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,825
Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.

470
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,621
And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,

471
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,246
but the boys found it
about 3km away from the car.

472
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,657
Hold onto it.

473
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,202
Yes, boss.

474
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,873
- Hello.
- This is jang dong-s...

475
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,285
What a surprise.

476
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,619
Do you know
the sintanjin murder case?

477
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,580
What about it?

478
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,282
That bastard did it.

479
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,993
What?

480
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,698
How do you know that?

481
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,124
We found his car in the area.

482
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,953
I've been doing quite well
lately.

483
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,744
I got all the way up here
by risking my life.

484
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,905
Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.

485
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,704
What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?

486
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,559
It's not like I can move aside
for him.

487
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,825
But that psycho
disappeared without a trace

488
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,912
after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.

489
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,990
Hey,

490
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,572
whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.

491
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,582
Reputation is everything
to a gangster.

492
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:49,824
I'll chop him up
and put him on display.

493
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:54,205
Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?

494
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,116
We punish people
in ways that the law can't.

495
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,291
Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?

496
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,785
No.

497
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,743
Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.

498
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,573
Here's his car key.

499
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,408
Do you not see me as a cop?

500
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,374
I can arrest you right away,
you know.

501
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,035
You won't though. Why?

502
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,833
Because you want him
more than I do.

503
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:43,035
I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.

504
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,657
We'll share information

505
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,623
and help each other out.

506
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,497
And the prize?

507
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,580
Do we split him in half?

508
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,119
Whoever catches him first
can keep him.

509
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,743
So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,

510
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,083
but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?

511
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,475
Join the game
if you're confident enough.

512
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,618
Count me in.

513
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,914
You'll regret this, you know.

514
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,872
He's a handsome fellow.

515
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:29,782
How old did he seem?

516
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,744
About mid-30s.

517
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,449
Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.

518
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,039
Keep in touch using this.

519
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,280
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

520
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,866
This is interesting!

521
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,118
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

522
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,790
This is interesting!

523
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,573
You motherfucker.

524
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,077
We're in the same boat.

525
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,998
I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.

526
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,741
It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?

527
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,993
So you went to all the trouble
to record me?

528
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,907
Fuck!

529
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,284
Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?

530
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,199
This is why I don't trust cops.

531
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,573
Unbelievable.

532
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,664
Just because I'm being lenient

533
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,661
doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.

534
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,490
Listen, you bastard.

535
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,906
When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!

536
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,619
He stabbed jang dong-su too

537
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,802
and is the culprit
behind the sintanjin case.

538
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,456
So what does this mean?

539
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,076
If things go as planned,
we can close five cases at once.

540
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,956
Mid-30s, male, average height.

541
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,958
Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.

542
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,325
He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.

543
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,823
It's one or the other.

544
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,957
He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.

545
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,782
There are no other clues so far.

546
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,953
I made a deal with
detective jeong.

547
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,323
We'll catch him together.

548
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,018
Obviously,
we won't tell the others.

549
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,578
How can we trust cops?

550
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,623
How can we trust gangsters?

551
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,908
Who said anything about trust?

552
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,408
We need manpower
to catch the killer

553
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,953
and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.

554
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,658
- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?

555
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,661
The major case squad
will take over,

556
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,038
get the media involved,
and have all the glory.

557
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,367
That's not all.
The chief is protecting jang,

558
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,870
so this is the only way
to solve this case.

559
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,783
The chief will get into trouble
too.

560
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,700
Jang has seen his face
and has his car.

561
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,828
We can't only rely
on the drawing.

562
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,032
We need fingerprints and DNA.

563
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,329
We'll help the gangsters
find the killer

564
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,157
and move in to make the arrest.

565
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,239
I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.

566
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:44,953
We're all
tax-paying citizen too.

567
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,994
Let's get support
from the cops for once.

568
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,124
On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,

569
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,204
but thousands of slot machines
are built here

570
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,782
and distributed
all over the country.

571
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,035
Sons of bitches.

572
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,581
Jeez.

573
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,601
I'm sure there will be
something to find.

574
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:16,117
Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.

575
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,199
We have to find something
no matter what.

576
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,039
We'll comb every inch of it.

577
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,623
Okay, let's begin.

578
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,658
We'll leave all the grunt work
to jang

579
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,658
and go through the cases
that have happened so far.

580
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,829
This is the security footage
from the highway.

581
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,282
Let's go over his pattern.

582
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,947
He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.

583
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,582
He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.

584
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,745
We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.

585
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,124
Even when dealing
with any other cases,

586
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,494
always consider the possibility
of serial killings.

587
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,508
If you find anything,
report to me right away.

588
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,323
He's a ticking time bomb.

589
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,989
He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.

590
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,948
Also, make sure you're discreet.

591
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,329
We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.

592
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,747
Nice, right?

593
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,078
Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.

594
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,741
Before we do though,
let's take care of sang-do.

595
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,202
Son of a bitch!

596
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,580
Are you insane?

597
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,532
What are you doing here?

598
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,282
What the hell do you think?

599
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,243
I was waiting for you.

600
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,206
I think you broke my back.

601
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,203
You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.

602
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,577
I almost had a heart attack.

603
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,868
Give me some.

604
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,949
- Nice.
- Could you look into this?

605
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,407
- It's urgent.
- What is it?

606
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,864
Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.

607
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,457
- Please look into them.
- Jeong tae-seok.

608
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,624
What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.

609
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,747
What isn't like me?

610
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,036
It's a filthy world.

611
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,331
I ought to get
my hands dirty too.

612
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,748
Right, it is filthy.

613
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,039
He's a weird one.

614
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,119
He left the weapon
for us to see.

615
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,162
"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.

616
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,865
Incompetent cops."

617
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,660
And now,
even a gang leader is dead.

618
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,123
What will you do?

619
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:49,535
What should we do about this?

620
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,283
Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?

621
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,032
The hur sang-do case...

622
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,833
Will be assigned to unit two
and they'll investigate it.

623
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,706
Do you still not get it?

624
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,616
Stop staring at the monitor

625
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,577
and hit the streets.

626
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,698
Right now!

627
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,866
I don't care if it's dog crap,

628
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,198
search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!

629
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:16,534
At least try to look
like you give a damn!

630
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:17,872
Hold your heads high!

631
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,208
Yeah, tell me.

632
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,453
Do you have a death wish?

633
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,908
- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.

634
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,897
I just got the results
on the samples.

635
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,162
- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.

636
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,284
DNA of the recent
south chungcheong murder victims

637
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,240
were detected in the samples.

638
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,333
Really?

639
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,323
Is that it?

640
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,328
Was there any unidentified DNA?

641
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,578
- None.
- That doesn't make sense.

642
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,351
Did you run the tests properly?

643
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,162
There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.

644
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,787
- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.

645
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,625
Go ahead.

646
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,075
DNA of the truck driver
and puppy mill owner

647
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,207
were all found on the weapon
used in the hur murder case.

648
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,292
What?

649
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,956
It means one person did it all.

650
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,947
It will be officially classified
as a serial killer case.

651
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,667
I've got to go.

652
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,865
Jang dong-su!

653
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,910
It was you, wasn't it?

654
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:18,952
It was you!

655
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,768
Sir, I'll have to call you back.

656
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,123
Answer me, motherfucker!

657
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,741
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Damn it!

658
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,956
Bastard!

659
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,949
Your idiot's back.

660
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,907
He barges in here
like it's his house.

661
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,033
Who else?
One of your detectives.

662
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,452
Right, we'll talk later.

663
00:50:58,417 --> 00:50:59,577
Damn it.

664
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,822
A cop in league with a gangster?
Fuck this world.

665
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,158
Aren't you a cop too?

666
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,833
Aren't you?

667
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,373
Tell me, asshole.

668
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,615
Did you kill hur sang-do?

669
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,073
Yes, I killed him.

670
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:31,076
I blame myself
for trusting a gangster.

671
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,907
You trusted me?

672
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,494
No one would buy that.

673
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,743
Nothing's changed.

674
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,408
We'll still catch
the killer together.

675
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,708
Got it?

676
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,410
When...

677
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,953
This is all over,

678
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:56,114
I'll investigate you properly.

679
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,410
Whatever.

680
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,538
The murder cases in the region
since July this year

681
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,162
were found to be killings
of a serial killer...

682
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,117
The police were yet
to find any substantial leads...

683
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,950
Major case squad
of the south chungcheong station

684
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,412
is now working alongside
the cheonan police.

685
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:24,288
The murders were handled
by various regional

686
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,866
police departments, but by
centralizing the investigation

687
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:32,332
there's new hope
for finally closing the cases.

688
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,665
We wish for these cases
to soon be solved

689
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,911
so that the people
can finally find peace again.

690
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,992
We'll hear more details
from the reporter on site.

691
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,243
You're here early.

692
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:42,997
Dong-cheol.

693
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,540
I'm outside Ace hotel,
where the murder took place

694
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,161
on September 3.

695
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:51,744
The victim of this crime
is said to be hur sang-do,

696
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:55,284
who led a gang
in the south chungcheong region.

697
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,535
He was said to be
in a turf war with...

698
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,788
If you'd handed over the case
from the beginning,

699
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,206
it wouldn't have come to this.

700
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,369
Murder isn't some child's play.

701
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:11,329
You guys only ruined
the fucking investigation.

702
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:15,955
Shouldn't you be more polite
if you're on our home ground?

703
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,786
Well, I'm not wrong, you prick.

704
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:21,327
Prick?

705
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,703
Keep talking, you piece of shit.

706
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,248
- What was that?
- Sir!

707
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,494
- Bring it on then!
- Come here!

708
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:32,160
- Fucker!
- Hey, stop it!

709
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:38,123
On the knife found
at the scene of hur's murder,

710
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,870
DNA evidence of other victims
were discovered.

711
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,656
A task force was set up to
investigate not only hur's case,

712
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,332
but other victims' cases
as well, as all the murders

713
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:51,534
are likely committed
by one killer...

714
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,365
But that wasn't my doing.

715
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,412
The task force that consists
of the major case squad

716
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,242
and homicide units

717
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:04,365
will be joined by the country's
top criminal profiler

718
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,576
and forensic experts
from various fields

719
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:12,364
in order to conduct
a thorough investigation.

720
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,572
The police will remain vigilant
as they are expecting

721
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:20,865
a huge turnout of gangs
at hur sang-do's funeral.

722
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,119
I'm surprised to see you here.

723
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,957
Of course I came.
He was my friend.

724
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:25,499
- Hello?
- Get over here right now.

725
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:27,248
Why should 1?

726
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,119
To clean up your
own fucking mess!

727
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,448
Get over here.

728
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,198
I don't think we've met.

729
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:04,289
Hur was killed with my knife
by someone else

730
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,870
Find something useful
if you wish to catch the guy.

731
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,868
If major case squad gets him
first, we are both fucked.

732
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,366
Is this what you've been doing
your entire life?

733
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,040
I pity your sorry cop's life.

734
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,116
So don't commit any crimes,
you moron.

735
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,290
If people like me aren't around,
you would be out of a job.

736
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:27,577
That's how life is.

737
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,453
Some commit crimes
and some catch them.

738
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,658
Right, and some get stabbed.

739
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,914
The bastard
attacked me from behind.

740
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,832
Still, I took his knife
and got a piece of him too.

741
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,282
Wait, hold it.

742
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,866
- What now?
- You stabbed him?

743
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,958
I did. Why?

744
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,703
I think I found something.

745
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,743
What the hell?

746
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,785
Sons of bitches.

747
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,990
Jang dong-su, what's going on?

748
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,039
Who are these guys?

749
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,331
Punks.

750
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,747
Move!

751
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,118
Get up.

752
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,539
Go to hell, you asshole!

753
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,744
Shit...

754
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:43,454
Hey! Motherfucker, no!

755
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,077
Fuck!

756
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,493
That's enough.

757
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:49,702
It's over now.

758
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,411
You should go.
I'll clean things up.

759
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,832
No, he's fine.

760
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,790
He just bled a lot.

761
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,157
It's just blood...

762
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,332
Get out of here, asshole!

763
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,030
Now that there
is enough evidence

764
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,744
to arrest hur's killer,

765
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,322
the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.

766
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,829
Due to the suspect's
limited method of killing

767
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,374
and small hunting ground,
the police are sure...

768
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,408
Honey, where are you?

769
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,162
Are you seriously napping when
something huge has happened?

770
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,073
Wait. What's with his face?

771
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,827
Wake up, you idiot!

772
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,950
What have you been up to lately?

773
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:28,993
What the...

774
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,782
Where are you going?

775
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,832
Here, take this.
It's a kidnapping case.

776
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,415
Sun-ho's already there,
so get going.

777
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,704
A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?

778
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,828
We have
a serial killer to catch.

779
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,032
That's enough!

780
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,580
Hey.

781
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:54,287
Can't you see that
major case squad is here?

782
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,530
They're working with unit one,
so take care of this.

783
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:06,368
I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.

784
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:09,579
But now major case squad
and unit one have taken over.

785
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,581
What the hell
do they know anyway?

786
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,244
They're clueless jerks!

787
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,287
You shithead.
What did you just say?

788
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,615
Shut up!

789
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,042
Tae-seok.

790
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,226
You insisted
it was serial killing

791
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,330
without any evidence.

792
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:29,158
There was no evidence
or even a witness.

793
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,452
If you were so confident,

794
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:31,902
you should have caught him
already.

795
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:36,702
Damn it.

796
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,995
The victim was a prolific ceo.

797
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,160
Tae-seok.

798
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,518
You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,

799
01:03:58,542 --> 01:03:59,542
so get on it.

800
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:05,284
Did something happen
while you were with jang?

801
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,956
What's with all the scars?

802
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,868
Something happened, right?

803
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,699
Cut the bullshit.

804
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:18,158
Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.

805
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,498
How many times does this make?

806
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,116
Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?

807
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,244
Is he even alive?

808
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,324
If you want the money,
put him on the phone!

809
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,286
This is the last time.

810
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:35,032
Be at jeil snack bar
in wolmyeong-dong.

811
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,702
Come right now.

812
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:47,030
What are you doing?
Go inside already.

813
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,624
Did you come by
to drop off the bag?

814
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,581
- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.

815
01:04:53,542 --> 01:04:56,375
Why is she handing her the cash?

816
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,414
What the hell.

817
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:06,490
Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?

818
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:16,495
Hey. Who's that on the roof?

819
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,410
It's him. He's on the roof!

820
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,991
Dong-cheol, he's headed north!

821
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,163
Where is he?

822
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,664
Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!

823
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,865
Hey!

824
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,786
- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!

825
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,828
Sun-ho, cut him off!

826
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:32,917
Stop!

827
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,120
- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!

828
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,655
- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?

829
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,328
Stop, you bastard!

830
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,740
Shit, he's bloody fast.

831
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,410
Stop right there!

832
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,748
- I'll head down!
- Hurry!

833
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,998
I don't see him from here!

834
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,199
- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?

835
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,285
Catch up when you can.

836
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,824
Up the stairs! Now!

837
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:14,955
Freeze!

838
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,082
He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!

839
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,205
Which way did he go?

840
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,282
Over there. That way!

841
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,574
Why did you take the bag

842
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,203
when you don't know
what's inside?

843
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,166
Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

844
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,533
Someone asked me to take it.

845
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:51,623
Who asked you?

846
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,579
Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.

847
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,407
I've never seen him before.

848
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,163
He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.

849
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,490
He gave me 20 dollars.

850
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,368
What did he look like?

851
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,495
Well, he looked quite average.

852
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,115
Did he only eat food here?

853
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,241
He drank a bottle of soju too!

854
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,581
Where's the bottle?

855
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,120
The labels differ
depending on the brand,

856
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,870
but they come in
the same bottle.

857
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,414
Have fun searching.

858
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,532
You've got to be kidding me.

859
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,748
- Dong-cheol!
- Yes?

860
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,365
Just check the relevant brand.

861
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,039
- It's not...
- Just the relevant brand!

862
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,581
This is unbelievable!

863
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,581
All the bottles are the same!

864
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,515
There's no need
to work so hard, you know.

865
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,205
Are you serious?

866
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,616
What about
the steering wheel cover?

867
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,382
The result will come out today
at the earliest.

868
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,872
That's why I'll only charge
two million won per machine.

869
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,833
Thank you.

870
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,040
I'll send the technicians
if you need them.

871
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,749
Isn't that too cheap, Mr. jang?

872
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,449
Of course, your generosity

873
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,199
will make us very happy indeed.

874
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:27,372
I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.

875
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,373
Look what happened to sang-do.

876
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:32,285
Watch out, everyone.

877
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,333
After dong-su got stabbed,
sang-do was killed,

878
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:38,284
and his lackey disappeared too.

879
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,828
Just shut up and eat, will you?

880
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,493
What brings you by?

881
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:10,615
Look for this guy first.

882
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,619
I found an odd fingerprint.

883
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,664
I don't know if it's damaged.

884
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,207
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

885
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,333
I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.

886
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,823
He's actually a missing person.

887
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,749
His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.

888
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,040
He hasn't come home
in about three months.

889
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,331
Did he say where he was going?

890
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,614
When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.

891
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,740
He's away quite a while
this time though.

892
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,116
I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.

893
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:41,873
Did he make any trouble?

894
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,575
No, not at all.
He never missed his rent

895
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:50,286
and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.

896
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,456
He lives a good, clean life.

897
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,534
Basis of mankind
who raised a monster?

898
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,332
Night darker than death
sacred violence

899
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,907
I found an odd fingerprint.

900
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,164
I don't know if it's damaged.

901
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,665
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

902
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,157
It's 017-684-2784!

903
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:09,203
Do a background check
on that number.

904
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,956
Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.

905
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:14,328
Send it to me right away.
Right now!

906
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,620
I heard you paid a ton
for sang-do's funeral.

907
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,409
Isn't dong-su one loyal guy?

908
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,248
I hope you
show me the same courtesy.

909
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,244
Didn't I tell you to just eat?

910
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,995
You talk too much.

911
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,496
Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?

912
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,992
I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.

913
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,539
Just eat your food!

914
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,407
Please continue.

915
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,116
I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.

916
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,580
Also, listen to this.

917
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,538
This is the last time.

918
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,448
Be at jeil snack bar
in wolmyeong-dong.

919
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,833
Come right now.

920
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,243
I'm sorry.

921
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,948
The road was slippery.

922
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,706
But I still hit your car.

923
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,332
Name, kang gyeong-ho. Age, 35.

924
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:32,159
He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.

925
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,493
He has no priors.

926
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,416
He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday

927
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,910
although both use
unlicensed phones.

928
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,786
Until August, his calls were

929
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,365
mainly from
chungcheong province,

930
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,496
but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.

931
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:49,826
We traced his calls
and they were mainly from ansan,

932
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,249
mostly from this district.

933
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:53,952
- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.

934
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,578
There are a few colleges,

935
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,953
so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,

936
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,409
and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.

937
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,832
What a hassle.

938
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:05,373
Which means,

939
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:09,284
he hid here after stabbing jang.

940
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,957
You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?

941
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,268
Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.

942
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,748
You fucking gangster.

943
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,249
You cops are no different.

944
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,698
Motherfucker!

945
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,158
- Damn it!
- Let go of me!

946
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,998
Do you want to die?

947
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:34,618
Come here.

948
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:44,875
Guys.

949
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,748
If we don't catch him,

950
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,749
we're all fucked,
don't you know that?

951
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,948
We're in the same boat now,

952
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,867
so let's see this through
no matter what.

953
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,620
Let's just do it, all right?

954
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,165
- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, boss!

955
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,579
As of this moment,
you have one single mission.

956
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:35,534
Find this fucker at all costs.

957
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:36,660
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!

958
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,956
Keep a low profile,

959
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,574
and if you see anyone
who resembles him,

960
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:46,000
call your superiors at once.

961
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,664
There will be
five of you in a team.

962
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,226
The team leader will update us
every eight hours,

963
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,456
three times a day.

964
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,161
Centering on daegyeong-dong,

965
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,913
search your designated areas
and keep looking further.

966
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:15,330
Check cheap motels,
inns, and studio apartments.

967
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,157
I've never seen him before.

968
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,657
Then check short-term renters

969
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,581
as well as
long-term guests at inns.

970
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,207
Search all these places
without fail.

971
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:26,327
Doan-dong.

972
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,832
In the afternoon,
check the downtown area,

973
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,580
markets, terminals
and other public areas.

974
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,822
At night, head to
bars, arcades, Internet cafes,

975
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,578
karaokes, and others.

976
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:50,623
- Got that?
- Yes, sir!

977
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:00,373
Check out jungho-dong as well.

978
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,789
That place closed down!

979
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:07,327
Damn it.

980
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,202
Shit.

981
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,374
Yes, I'm outside, so hurry up.

982
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:18,667
Okay.

983
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,743
When is the bus coming?

984
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,949
Hey, kid. Come over here.

985
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,327
Take this then.

986
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,911
- I'm fine.
- Take it!

987
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,499
Okay. Thank you.

988
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,907
What about you though?

989
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:44,948
Study hard.

990
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,282
Hey, jang dong-su!

991
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,787
This isn't the time
to have a team dinner.

992
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,116
You can't keep them working
on an empty stomach.

993
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,032
O-seong will be here soon.

994
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,660
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

995
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,660
There.

996
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:02,248
Don't pretend to be a Saint.

997
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,706
- You there!
- Yes?

998
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:08,868
You can't receive items
from strangers like that.

999
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,831
He's a thug!

1000
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,703
You seem more like one
if you ask me.

1001
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:13,827
What?

1002
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,823
Don't laugh.

1003
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,740
- Bye!
- Be careful, all right?

1004
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:20,952
Thank you, sir.

1005
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:35,288
- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!

1006
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,788
- Until the end of time!
- We are one!

1007
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,914
- Thank you, boss!
- Thank you, boss!

1008
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:50,076
Hearing that
just made my dick tingle.

1009
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,327
What a fucking life.

1010
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,749
I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.

1011
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,619
Just get your job done.

1012
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,289
How is working for a salary
the same

1013
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,741
as risking one's neck every day?

1014
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:06,197
You're still a fucking thug,
so you can have a drink.

1015
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,530
Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.

1016
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,241
I bring in these liquor,
so drink freely.

1017
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,575
You're involved
in every type of business.

1018
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,956
Do you want to join us?

1019
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,372
Should 1?

1020
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:24,702
You should.

1021
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,038
You look the part
and will go far in a gang.

1022
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,948
Shut your face and have a drink.

1023
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,623
Fine, pour me one.

1024
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,832
Hey, I wasn't turning away
to show respect or anything.

1025
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:50,576
Shit. My glass is so greasy.

1026
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,912
Dal-ho! I feel shitty,
so sing me a song.

1027
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:57,785
Detective, did you know
that I was a boy band trainee?

1028
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:02,456
I'll sing a kick-ass song
for you all.

1029
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,039
Today in ansan,

1030
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,786
there was a murder...

1031
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,991
Wait, shut it. Turn that up.

1032
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,072
The high school victim
was on her way home

1033
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:14,953
when she was murdered.

1034
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,322
Considering how young she is,

1035
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,913
the police are ruling out
revenge as a motive,

1036
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,374
and leaning towards
a sexual assault

1037
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,618
or a random attack

1038
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,664
as a potential motive...

1039
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,785
O-seong.

1040
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:32,032
- Get the hell up!
- Yes, boss!

1041
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,491
Search every unit
along the bus 32 route.

1042
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,411
What did we miss?

1043
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,331
North of dohwa-dong,
southwest of wolpo-dong.

1044
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:39,998
It's 1km from
the central square!

1045
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,167
Move it!

1046
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,411
He's here somewhere,
so stay focused.

1047
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,910
Come up from daegyeong-dong.

1048
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,532
We'll head down
from songgeon-dong.

1049
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,331
I'm searching
the central square!

1050
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:50,393
I think I found him,
it's the dohwa motel district.

1051
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:53,124
Gather the boys
and check the cars too.

1052
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:55,540
Witness found
at the dohwa motel district.

1053
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,161
Don't just search the motels

1054
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,832
and look into bars
and karaokes too.

1055
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,907
Excuse me, I'm a cop.

1056
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,828
He's staying in room 304.

1057
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,365
What's going on?

1058
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,665
Tell me! Where is he?

1059
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,615
He left a minute ago.

1060
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,032
Hey, I found him.

1061
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,704
Keep your eyes peeled.
We must get him first.

1062
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:28,659
Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.

1063
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,457
Don't take any action
and let him walk back here.

1064
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:32,942
Don't tell me what to do,
you prick.

1065
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,740
Cancel the search party

1066
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,369
and bring
just two more with you here.

1067
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,198
Stay still.

1068
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:05,952
Get down.

1069
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,855
Nice to meet you again,
little fucker.

1070
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:23,782
Fucking bastard.

1071
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,240
He drives like a maniac.

1072
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:38,702
Hey!

1073
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:40,702
Stop the car, bastard!

1074
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,035
Stop!

1075
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:54,952
Fuck.

1076
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,365
Stop the car!

1077
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,160
Out of the way!

1078
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:18,657
Damn them!

1079
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,282
You fucking asshole!

1080
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,452
What was that?

1081
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:02,164
I was after that bastard!

1082
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:04,702
Over there.

1083
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,914
Son of a bitch!

1084
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,289
Fucking hell.

1085
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:17,532
You, go that way.

1086
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,115
Asshole.

1087
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:08,077
Hey.

1088
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,750
Hey!

1089
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,493
O-seong, no!

1090
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,831
Stay with me, o-seong!

1091
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:15,911
- O-seong...
- Over there...

1092
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,122
That way!

1093
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,198
Hurry.

1094
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:25,743
Damn it.

1095
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:35,782
Pang pang karaoke

1096
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:12,577
Where are you?

1097
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:14,202
This fucker is mine now.

1098
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:15,702
Where the fuck are you?

1099
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,990
Track down jang's location!

1100
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,328
He took the killer.
Find him fast!

1101
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:35,907
Fasten your seat belt.

1102
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,161
You can't die before I kill you.

1103
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:41,158
- Stop at a rest stop.
- What?

1104
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,077
I'm starving.

1105
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,625
This is fun.

1106
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:09,953
How are we different?

1107
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:16,203
That's pretty obvious,
don't you think?

1108
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,582
You shouldn't have stabbed me,
you puny jerk.

1109
01:29:24,917 --> 01:29:26,327
Fucker.

1110
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,330
Isn't it fun

1111
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,866
to play with a man's life?

1112
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,037
He drove down to cheonan.

1113
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,559
He was caught on camera
at the tollgate.

1114
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,743
Son of a bitch.

1115
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:55,081
Do you know

1116
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,824
what the most
exhilarating part is?

1117
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,749
Shut the fuck up.

1118
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:07,248
Do you like minced meat?

1119
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:12,034
I'm going to chop you up nicely

1120
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,039
and spray your guts everywhere.

1121
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,115
Motherfucker.

1122
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,035
It's this moment.

1123
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:25,118
When life and death
is in your hands.

1124
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,123
Give it a go.

1125
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:29,573
Get on with it.

1126
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:31,740
Kill me!

1127
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,912
Do you even listen to yourself?

1128
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:42,117
Did you think you'd live
after killing all those people?

1129
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:44,248
That's why you should kill me.

1130
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:49,500
Try to stay still. I'd rather
not get your blood on me.

1131
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:16,202
Shit.

1132
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:33,077
Sorry, buddy,

1133
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:37,157
but I'm still a cop.

1134
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,206
Nice to meet you, asshole.

1135
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:07,782
Kang gyeong-ho, you're
under arrest for homicide.

1136
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:15,115
Even a devil like you

1137
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:18,282
can retain an attorney

1138
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:22,034
and have the right
to remain silent.

1139
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,832
Anything you say can be used

1140
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,449
against you in a court of law.

1141
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:33,624
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1142
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,164
one will be appointed to you
in courtesy of

1143
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,447
this nation's taxpayers,
you asshole.

1144
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:58,166
- What the hell?
- Isn't it obvious?

1145
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:00,657
He's the serial killer.

1146
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:02,493
Come here.

1147
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:05,823
What are you staring at?

1148
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:07,327
Go home!

1149
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,206
Pack up!

1150
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,407
Come here, you psycho.

1151
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,289
- One moment, please!
- Make way!

1152
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:18,240
- Let us through.
- Make way!

1153
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:22,326
While investigating a kidnapping
case from September,

1154
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,073
the cheonan police obtained
key evidence that led to kang.

1155
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:30,580
He's currently being treated
for minor injuries,

1156
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:32,407
and he'll be investigated
by the police

1157
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,197
before being handed over
to the prosecutor.

1158
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,535
Let's move on.

1159
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:41,789
Slot arcades are becoming
a social issue as of late.

1160
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,412
The prosecution traced

1161
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,957
how these arcades
are funding gangsters

1162
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:51,497
and is currently after
Zeus' gang leader jang.

1163
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:55,079
Jang who operates
several dozen slot arcades

1164
01:33:55,542 --> 01:33:58,909
has made a fortune
by illegally modifying

1165
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,491
and distributing
arcade machines.

1166
01:34:01,792 --> 01:34:05,159
However, his current
whereabouts are unknown.

1167
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:09,613
This is all your doing,
isn't it?

1168
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,368
No.

1169
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:15,416
You convinced the world
that he's the killer,

1170
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,268
but now there's no evidence?

1171
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,908
Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.

1172
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,623
Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.

1173
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,414
Even if I were the judge,

1174
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,582
I wouldn't
give him the death penalty.

1175
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,623
- What's this?
- A knife.

1176
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:36,659
Yes, one you used
to murder all those people.

1177
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,789
What has been
your concept in life?

1178
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:44,249
I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?

1179
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,740
It's because you're not human.

1180
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,703
Then what's yours?

1181
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,665
A good cop? A model citizen?

1182
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,706
You can't answer me, can you?

1183
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,037
Who lives their life
by following a concept?

1184
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:05,117
We live because we do.

1185
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,994
I wore gloves for my first kill,

1186
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:13,333
but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.

1187
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,740
Each stab should
always be clean.

1188
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,248
That feeling when it goes in?

1189
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,994
You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.

1190
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,994
I guess
it's something like that.

1191
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:28,123
And these photos?

1192
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,205
What is it?

1193
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,786
The order's all wrong.

1194
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:49,791
Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?

1195
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,496
And even if I get
the death penalty,

1196
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,285
you know I won't die.

1197
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:00,413
You little bastard.

1198
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,535
- I'll kill you!
- Hey, stop!

1199
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,660
Stop it!

1200
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,412
- Come here. I'll kill you!
- Stop it!

1201
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,990
Don't do it!

1202
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:15,076
If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,

1203
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,448
then that's murder.

1204
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:23,581
The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.

1205
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:27,074
Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.

1206
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,453
Do you really have that right?

1207
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,539
If you're innocent,

1208
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,203
then I am too.

1209
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:48,297
Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?

1210
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:51,743
I did.

1211
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:55,781
This knife was used
to kill five victims

1212
01:36:56,042 --> 01:36:58,158
between July
and September of 2005.

1213
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,660
Objection, your honor.

1214
01:37:00,042 --> 01:37:02,158
The prosecution has not provided
any concrete link

1215
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,572
between the knife
and my client during this trial.

1216
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,366
It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.

1217
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,493
Yes, you're right.

1218
01:37:10,917 --> 01:37:13,158
This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...

1219
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,206
At least until now.

1220
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:20,747
Your honor, we'd like
to request a sole survivor

1221
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,199
of kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.

1222
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:29,199
Witness, please take the stand.

1223
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:58,374
You've got balls showing
your face in front of me.

1224
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:00,157
Damn, you look terrible.

1225
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,497
We pay tax so that you can
arrest and kill those fuckers.

1226
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:11,245
That's how the law is.

1227
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,537
It arrests people
and punishes them,

1228
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,867
but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.

1229
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,950
Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!

1230
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,162
You're my last resort.

1231
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,117
Let's use the law
to kill the bastard.

1232
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,157
Stop your bullshit.

1233
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:45,493
Turn yourself in.

1234
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,412
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1235
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:54,870
- Did you kill hur sang-do?
- Yes, I did.

1236
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:59,082
- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!

1237
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:03,530
Once this goes public,
you and I are both screwed.

1238
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,322
Don't force me to use this.
All right?

1239
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,573
Surrender and become a witness.

1240
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,456
You're the only witness.

1241
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,832
With you on the witness stand,

1242
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:15,703
I can link him
to all the murders!

1243
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:17,952
I'd rather...

1244
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,498
Just get screwed together.

1245
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:25,080
I swear that the evidence that
I shall give shall be the truth,

1246
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,700
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me god.

1247
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,118
Your honor.

1248
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,741
The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang

1249
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:38,494
who is accused
of several serious crimes

1250
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:41,575
including illegal gambling
as well as embezzlement.

1251
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:44,124
Nothing in the law states that

1252
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,950
a criminal suspect
can't testify in another case.

1253
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:48,292
I accept.

1254
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:49,868
Witness,

1255
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:54,781
how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?

1256
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,616
Guys like me
who get stabbed regularly

1257
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:09,621
don't forget our attackers
until the day we die.

1258
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,206
That bastard was the one.

1259
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,660
Here.

1260
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:21,790
I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.

1261
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,081
Your honor,
that is simply a drawing

1262
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:29,874
one drew in
his or her free time.

1263
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:32,018
It has no legal ground and
cannot be proved scientifically

1264
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:34,124
and therefore cannot be
admitted as evidence.

1265
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:35,288
Your honor,

1266
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:39,535
this is the witness'
medical record from the hospital

1267
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,167
stating his condition
immediately after the attack.

1268
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:44,198
The witness is a gang leader.

1269
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:47,242
Getting stabbed
is normal for him.

1270
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,494
How can that be evidence

1271
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:51,351
when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?

1272
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:53,582
He's violating
the defendant's rights

1273
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:55,282
and is mocking this court!

1274
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:57,206
Damn, that fucker talks a lot.

1275
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,493
- Hey, Mr. attorney.
- Witness!

1276
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,199
Would you be able to say that

1277
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:03,702
if your family
was killed by him?

1278
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:07,614
The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.

1279
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:11,079
That fucker
killed people for fun.

1280
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:15,034
I'm not decent myself,
but he doesn't deserve to live.

1281
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:16,917
Evidence?

1282
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,285
I'll show you the evidence.

1283
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:34,706
That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.

1284
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:37,829
Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.

1285
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:41,409
During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.

1286
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,618
I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?

1287
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:50,124
If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.

1288
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,957
You should have him
take his clothes off too.

1289
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:57,621
I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.

1290
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,325
Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.

1291
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:09,789
Stabbing is a tricky job,

1292
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,831
so you cut yourself
here and there.

1293
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,619
Your nails get broken too.

1294
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,740
And lastly,

1295
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,411
that fucker wrote this.

1296
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,953
Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.

1297
01:42:28,292 --> 01:42:30,533
For reference,
hur sang-do was my friend.

1298
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:33,116
Hur was killed with my knife

1299
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:37,034
hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.

1300
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,081
I feel bad for o-seong,

1301
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,573
but if kang spills everything,

1302
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:43,782
we can blame o-seong for it.

1303
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:47,991
Hur was killed with my knife
by someone else

1304
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,707
hur was killed with my knife

1305
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:57,456
considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,

1306
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:01,580
wanton disregard for human life,

1307
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:04,369
and the pain
suffered by the victims,

1308
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:11,121
his sentence was decided
by weighing all the offenses.

1309
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:14,742
Ergo, defendant kang gyeong-ho

1310
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,368
is sentenced to death.

1311
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,456
61st police appreciation day

1312
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:28,792
thank you, sir!

1313
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,202
About-face!

1314
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,198
Salute!

1315
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:54,450
Boss is coming! Let's greet him!

1316
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,340
- Good afternoon, boss!
- Good afternoon, boss!

1317
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,957
- Only on one condition.
- Which is what?

1318
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,370
Have me locked up
in the same prison.

1319
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,332
Three men played the game
with their necks on the line.

1320
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:33,905
It should damn well be finished.

1321
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,790
Don Lee aka ma dong seok

1322
01:45:57,833 --> 01:46:02,782
Kim moo yul

1323
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:07,782
Kim sung kyu
