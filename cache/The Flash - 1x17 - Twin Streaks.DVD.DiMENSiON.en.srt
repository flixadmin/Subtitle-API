1
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,792
Now kick it.

2
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:38,264
- He's a regular little jet engine, isn't he?
- What about his vital functions?

3
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,928
Oh, he's fine.

4
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,240
Now really open up.

5
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,726
Oh, my God.

6
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,139
Damn it!

7
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,008
Right, right. No problem.

8
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,717
Jason.

9
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,790
Jason, listen I think we should seriously
consider shutting down the project.

10
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,487
- Absolutely not.
- We're running short of money...

11
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,633
...we're way behind and...

12
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,026
And?

13
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:50,575
And I just can't get the other night
out of my mind.

14
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,009
That poor man.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,649
For the last time, Whitcomb,
that was not a man.

16
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,284
Do you hear me? That was a replicant.

17
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,319
A clone that I grew
from a genetic sample.

18
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,515
Like a hothouse flower.
I made him.

19
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,919
- But he was alive.
- Well, he's not anymore.

20
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,223
And you'd do well to remember
that in your whining.

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,659
Now, what we are doing
is illegal, highly illegal.

22
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,501
Look, Jason...

23
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,404
...it was really a great idea.

24
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,840
I mean, create a line
of superfast synthetic humans.

25
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:30,346
Workers, couriers, whatever they'd need,
we'd have a superclone to fit the bill.

26
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:37,350
But the process doesn't work.
We have to face the facts. It's over.

27
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,055
No.

28
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,154
We can't quit now. We're too close.

29
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,389
- We can make it work.
- How?

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,990
Cloning is not the problem.

31
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,500
It's the adrenophines we use
to increase the speed.

32
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,935
Normal tissue can't withstand the strain.
It breaks down.

33
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,836
So, what do we do?

34
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,775
You find a human being whose tissue
can withstand hyperspeed.

35
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,046
The Flash.

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,917
Okay. Really?

37
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,184
Same as always. On the shelves,
alphabetically by author.

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,792
Go.

39
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,946
Stop.

40
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,549
Well?

41
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,584
Twenty percent slower
than three months ago.

42
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,122
And your heart rate's faster.
You can get dressed.

43
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,958
Thank you.

44
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,138
Three books out of place. Three mental
errors, first you've ever made.

45
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,140
Three? Oh, no.

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,911
Come on, Tina. I'm having a bad day,
that's all. Lighten up. I feel great.

47
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,309
Feeling great is hardly firm,
empirical evidence.

48
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,953
Here are your blood-chemistry results.
Look.

49
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,852
Blood sugar down, iron down.
And here's something that's up:

50
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:30,325
Adrenaline levels. Barry,
you're exhausted, severely fatigued.

51
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,657
You're at 80 percent capacity
and getting worse.

52
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,426
I keep telling you, I feel great.

53
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,537
Yes, you feel great. But have you ever seen
a light bulb before it burns out?

54
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,834
For a moment or two it shines
very brightly, and then it's gone.

55
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,704
I'm not burning out.

56
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,273
Maybe you're not, Barry. But you're running
on pure energy and willpower.

57
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,182
- It has to take its toll somehow.
- Listen, I am only doing what I have to do.

58
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,718
I mean, look at these newspaper clippings.

59
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
"Flash saves little girl
from runaway bus."

60
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,825
"Flash races heart-attack victim
to hospital."

61
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,122
"Flash saves family
from burning building."

62
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,993
- Fifteen sightings in the past five days.
- Ask them if they were glad I was there.

63
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,133
I'm sure they were, Barry.
But at what cost to you?

64
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:17,208
I can handle it. I'm not like other men.
You, of all people, should know that.

65
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,908
- I can do things others can't.
- Barry, listen to yourself.

66
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,845
Do you think you're God.
Or that you're immortal?

67
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,947
You're showing signs
of stress syndrome.

68
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,649
Decreased physical capacities, impaired
decision-making. I can't make it any clearer.

69
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,727
If you don't slow down,
you're gonna collapse. You may even die.

70
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,032
- What are you doing now?
- I'm patched in to 911.

71
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,166
Some lunatic called the newspaper...

72
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,602
...told them he'd planted a bomb
in a locker at the train station.

73
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,273
I can beat the bomb squad.

74
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,448
False alarm.

75
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,712
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

76
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,672
And all from a drop of blood...

77
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,116
...treated with adrenophines
and hormones to accelerate growth.

78
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,653
Yeah.

79
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,710
It's time.

80
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,682
Let's meet our creation.

81
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,851
I found no trace of poison on the blade,
and there was no explosive inside.

82
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,286
But it was a trap.
The bomb scare was a hoax.

83
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,451
The robot was radio-controlled, but why?
It obviously wasn't meant to kill.

84
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,497
Whatever it was, it was meant to hurt
you. The cut was almost to the bone.

85
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,999
I thought so. You're not healing
as quickly as you usually do.

86
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,605
- The cut should be almost gone by now.
- I'll be fine.

87
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,332
This is another symptom,
don't you see that?

88
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,943
- It's all stress-related.
- Okay. I understand.

89
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,273
Now can we move away
from my being stressed...

90
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,642
...and get back
to what happened at the station?

91
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,876
Okay. Let's review this from the top.

92
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,317
Maybe this was just a test.

93
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,514
A dry run for a bigger attempt
on you later.

94
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,516
Could be.

95
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:15,638
So, what do you think of our latest
model here? Isn't he incredible?

96
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,505
He's already learning at 100 times
the speed of his predecessors.

97
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,011
An hour ago he was
making gurgling noises...

98
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,116
...now he's beginning to understand
simple words and concepts.

99
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,478
What's causing it?

100
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:31,186
The combination of his growth hormones
and his speeded-up metabolism.

101
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,917
- It's amazing.
- Well, don't you think it's dangerous?

102
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,583
- Why?
- Well, look at him.

103
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,161
He's a child trapped in a man's body.

104
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,630
No morality, no sense of right or wrong.
And yet tremendously powerful.

105
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,828
- Doesn't that scare you?
- No.

106
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,002
What we have here is something
incredible. This changes everything.

107
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,007
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,642
Don't you see?

109
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,249
The Intellagen project as we know it
is obsolete.

110
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,009
But this goes way beyond that.

111
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,644
Wait, you said we were gonna
create a high-speed drone here.

112
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,485
- Now, that's what we've got.
- We have more than that.

113
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,891
What we have is a whole new species.
A synthetic human...

114
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,224
...who can move faster
than bullets or bombs.

115
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,000
And we can create hundreds of them.
Thousands!

116
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,572
Just imagine what a foreign country
would pay for an army of these.

117
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,575
I'm talking soldiers, intelligence agents,
assassins.

118
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,546
- A race of warriors.
- That is not what this project is about.

119
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,708
You said we were gonna create
a force of good in the world.

120
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,285
Wrong.

121
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,218
I said it would make us rich.

122
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,888
And it will.

123
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,252
Any nation on the map would
pay millions for just one of these.

124
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,598
He needs a name.

125
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,601
How about...

126
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:58,571
...Pollux? Like Castor and Pollux,
the Gemini twins in Roman mythology.

127
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,476
Now, as fast as you can,
stack the blocks.

128
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,854
Try again.

129
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,976
Hey!

130
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,615
Hey! You little fool, you could kill us.

131
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,379
Stop it!

132
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,197
Try again, son.

133
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,183
Good boy.

134
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,958
Hungry.

135
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,320
Jason, about this warrior business, I don't
know if our investors are gonna approve.

136
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,547
Then we won't tell them.
We'll close down the project...

137
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,818
...say it's a failure and set up
shop somewhere else secretly.

138
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,189
- But that wouldn't be honest.
- Be realistic.

139
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,594
We don't want them to know
what we're doing, do we?

140
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,062
Oh, no.

141
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,235
Hurt.

142
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,507
Here.

143
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,307
Feel his arm.

144
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,845
He's burning up.
From the exertion.

145
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,986
I should have thought of this.

146
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,849
We need to build him
a protective suit.

147
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,056
Something in honor of his real father.

148
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,391
What was Allen thinking of?

149
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,829
He's been working hard.
It's just a slip-up.

150
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,266
I got seven men sitting on their
hands, and to you it's a slip-up?

151
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,839
Allen, get over here.

152
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,634
- Mad?
- Meltdown.

153
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,979
- Afternoon, lieutenant.
- Where are the Franklin murder case...

154
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,845
...and the Roe Street hit-and-run files?
- Franklin...

155
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,452
Well, that would be in the active box.

156
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,421
No, I'll tell you where these
two active felony files are, Mr. Allen.

157
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,254
They're at the deactivation
storage center, 20 miles away.

158
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,954
- Of all of the incompetent...
- Now, whoa, wait a minute.

159
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,099
- No, you wait a minute.
- What's this about?

160
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,293
Looks like Barry got on a housecleaning
kick and he overdid it.

161
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,529
Retired some active stuff by mistake.

162
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,402
If the investigative units
weren't so slow and sloppy...

163
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,169
...we wouldn't have 10,000 files
cluttering up the place.

164
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,109
- Who you calling slow and sloppy?
- Lf the shoe fits, sir.

165
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,148
Excuse me while
I stop the suspension.

166
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,150
- Like I said, it was an honest mis...
- What I don't need...

167
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,584
...is somebody making excuses for me.
- Oh, yeah.

168
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,782
- He can come up with his own alibis.
- One more crack, Garfield...

169
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,395
Lieutenant, I'm sure Julio could
retrieve those files for you quickly.

170
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,294
- I'll get them myself if I have to.
- I'm sure they'll be in proper hands soon.

171
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,301
Barry, you and I need to take a walk.
I'll see you downstairs in a few minutes.

172
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,468
- What's eating him?
- Please excuse him, lieutenant.

173
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,670
- He's under extreme stress.
- Aren't we all.

174
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,613
I'm treating him for it. He'll be himself
very soon. I promise you.

175
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,849
I wish I had a pretty doctor
to treat my stress.

176
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,430
Your blowup was a classic sign of stress.
You were almost irrational in there.

177
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,624
I was only one
of two irrational people.

178
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,865
Okay, so I was a little out of line.

179
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,565
All right, way out of line,
but he started it.

180
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,938
Petulance. I love that in a man.

181
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,877
What do you think?

182
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,483
I'd say it's perfect.

183
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,022
Tonight we take him outside
and see what he can do.

184
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,219
Outside. I want to go now. Please.

185
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,856
I said, tonight. Now go back
to your lessons.

186
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't know about any of this. We didn't
start this project to create a weapon.

187
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,401
- Calm down.
- For God's sake...

188
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,204
...you're talking about teaching him
to kill.

189
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,243
Let's get something clear.

190
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,316
You handle the business end,
but Pollux is my creation.

191
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,680
I decide what we do with him.

192
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,152
Now, don't you become a problem.

193
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,785
Pollux?

194
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,921
Pollux?

195
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,224
Pollux?

196
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,629
Damn it. You left the door open.

197
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,321
Can I play too?

198
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,247
Hey! Hey! Hey!

199
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,784
What in God's name?

200
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,153
Stay here.

201
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,779
- Barry, are you okay?
- I can't breathe.

202
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,387
Hello.

203
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,325
- Who...? What are you?
- Let's play.

204
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,895
- Stop it.
- Tina!

205
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,497
Let me go!

206
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,296
It was only a game.

207
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,864
Pollux!

208
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,534
Come here. Right now.

209
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,471
I have to go. Maybe we can
play again sometime.

210
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,011
Wait.

211
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,346
- Barry.
- Are you all right?

212
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,718
- Yes, I'm fine. We better get out of here.
- Yeah.

213
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,893
- Come on, Pollux.
- I don't want to go.

214
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,757
That's not up to you.

215
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,136
<i>Eyewitness reports</i>
<i>are so conflicting...</i>

216
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,139
<i>... police say they need several</i>
<i>more hours to sort them out.</i>

217
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,176
<i>Everything from a bizarre windstorm</i>
<i>to an alien invasion...</i>

218
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:52,113
<i>... claim to have been seen by those</i>
<i>present. And now in other news</i>...

219
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,912
It's a miracle no one was killed.
The park was in chaos.

220
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,681
- Tina, it was me.
- Yes, but did you hear him speak?

221
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,689
- The lilt, the emotions.
- Yeah, he sounded young.

222
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,022
Exactly. Like an angry, petulant child.

223
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,562
- Who is he? Where does he come from?
- I don't know.

224
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,895
But whoever he is, he not
only looks like me, he has my powers.

225
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,831
And he's dangerous.

226
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,404
We've gotta find him
before somebody gets hurt.

227
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,083
You see what he's doing?

228
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,484
Yeah. Isn't it amazing? He's reading
the equivalent of a book a minute.

229
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,584
Imagine. He'll have a college education
in a couple hours.

230
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,157
- We've gotta do something.
- What do you mean?

231
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,231
You saw what happened.
He's dangerous.

232
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,359
People could have been killed.
Jason, he scares me.

233
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,732
You sound like
an hysterical old woman.

234
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,306
Look, we almost lost control of him.

235
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,434
With all the knowledge he's absorbing,
who knows what he's capable of?

236
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,443
Jason, I...

237
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,319
- I think we should destroy him.
- Don't be absurd!

238
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,683
- Keep your voice down.
- Look.

239
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,816
When Pollux is ready, I intend
to sell him to the highest bidder.

240
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,054
I'm gonna use that money
to make a factory...

241
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,164
...to manufacture thousands more
like him.

242
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,359
If you don't wanna be part of that,
there's the door, but don't...

243
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,401
...interfere with this.

244
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,166
- Dr. Brossell.
- What? What is it?

245
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,046
- Who am I?
- I don't have the time...

246
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,707
...to deal with this right now.
Go back to your books.

247
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,545
But I need... I need to know.

248
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,755
Where am I from?

249
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,584
Who are my parents?

250
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,695
I've read about this.

251
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,559
But I...

252
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,669
I have no memory...

253
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,043
...of growing up.

254
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,743
You're who and what you are
right now.

255
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,576
- That's all you need to know.
- Yeah, but there's more.

256
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,242
I mean, there has to be.

257
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,178
Am I good?

258
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,892
- Am I bad?
- Aren't we getting philosophical...

259
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,861
...in our old age? Look, just shut up
and go back to your books.

260
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,499
Jason, don't speak to him like that.

261
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,972
I want to find out who I am.

262
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,404
You tell me.

263
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,535
All right, I will.

264
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,412
You're nothing.

265
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,517
Absolutely nothing.

266
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,886
A random accumulation of molecules
grown in a lab.

267
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:52,186
An experiment, a lab animal.

268
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:56,300
Who, at the moment, is getting on
my nerves. Now let go of my arm.

269
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,599
I don't believe you.

270
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,870
Everyone is someone.

271
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,115
- Now, where do you think you're going?
- To find out the truth!

272
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,049
- To find out who I am.
- Ted, the tranquilizer gun.

273
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,734
Barry, I think I've got something.

274
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,664
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it was on his chest.

275
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:50,304
- Intellagen Corp., 4919 Denny Avenue.
- I'm on my way.

276
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,576
Barry, I was just remembering the park.

277
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:58,189
- What if you can't stop this thing?
- First, I have to find it.

278
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,895
Excuse me.

279
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,101
- Is something wrong?
- What?

280
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,566
What do you want?

281
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,636
I'm Barry Allen,
with the police department.

282
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,577
Yeah.

283
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,581
I've told the police everything
I know. Several times.

284
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,653
That was an accident.
I found Ted Whitcomb's body.

285
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,949
I don't know what else I can say.

286
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:53,325
Well, tell me,
exactly what does Intellagen do?

287
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,262
Genetic research.

288
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,201
- But we're out of business.
- Really?

289
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,101
My partner's death leaves me
without financing.

290
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:09,212
- I'm afraid I'm not a good businessman.
- I see. That's too bad.

291
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,846
You'll have to excuse me.

292
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,926
Barry.

293
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,436
What are you wearing?
That's the most ridiculous...

294
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,631
Stop that.

295
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,169
Don't laugh at me.

296
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,278
I'm sorry.

297
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,914
I brought you flowers.

298
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:25,283
- Don't you like them?
- Yes, they're very nice.

299
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:32,491
I went to three different shops.
I didn't know what kind you liked, so...

300
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,954
Thank you.

301
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,271
It was really great running in to you
in the park the other day.

302
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,705
I'm sorry if I scared you.

303
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,610
- My name is Pollux.
- My name is Tina.

304
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,341
I know.

305
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,320
Pollux, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

306
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,526
- Who?
- He's a friend of mine.

307
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,993
And I think you'd like him
very much.

308
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,789
- Do you mind if I call him?
- All right.

309
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,764
Oh, good.

310
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,608
Yes, this is Barry Allen.

311
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,746
Tina, I've got it. I know who he is.

312
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,478
What?

313
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:29,286
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
Listen, Tina, be very careful.

314
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,834
You and me...

315
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,274
...we're the same.

316
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,073
Barry, this is Pollux.

317
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,143
Barry.

318
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,949
Is that your name?

319
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,155
My name...

320
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,884
Barry. Barry what?

321
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,586
Show him, Barry.
Tell him who you are.

322
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:17,792
I'm Barry Allen.
I live on Edgemore Street.

323
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,698
I work for the police department.

324
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,402
- I'm a forensic...
- A policeman.

325
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,508
It's all here. My whole life.

326
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:35,016
No, it's my life. I'm Barry Allen.

327
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,787
- You and I are not the same person.
- I come from you. I am you.

328
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:43,016
- No.
- Calm down. It's all right, Pollux.

329
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,127
- Barry, whatever you do, don't spook him.
- He's not human, Tina.

330
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,130
- He's a clone.
- What?

331
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,566
It's all right here in the Intellagen file.

332
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,433
He was created in a lab...

333
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,006
...from elements in my blood,
from my DNA.

334
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,905
- Oh, my God.
- There's no telling...

335
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,636
...how dangerous he might be.

336
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,312
I am him! I am me!

337
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,749
- Brossell was wrong!
- Pollux, listen to me.

338
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,358
I'm not Pollux. I'm Barry Allen.

339
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,440
Welcome back, Bar.

340
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,510
I got those files. Garfield is on his way
to pick them up.

341
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:44,545
- My office.
- Yeah, don't start on how it's dirty again.

342
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,822
Those are some nice threads, man.
Way to go, Bar.

343
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,925
Bar.

344
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,812
Those files are on the desk. Garfield
should be here soon to pick them up.

345
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:18,217
I know how you'd like to give them to him,
but please just hand them to him, all right?

346
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,447
Files.

347
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,922
Yeah, the files I drove
all that way to get back?

348
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,260
Garfield. Big, mean, outranks us?

349
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,821
The files.

350
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,699
Sure. Files, yeah.

351
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,042
Interesting look, Allen.

352
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,271
You get those at the circus?
Or did Mendez take you shopping?

353
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,418
- The circus?
- Lieutenant, we got those files for you.

354
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
Barry, can you give
the lieutenant the files?

355
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,823
Barry.

356
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,955
Barry Allen.

357
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,597
It's my name.

358
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,858
It's my name.

359
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,395
Yeah, well, now that we know
who all the players are, Barry...

360
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:12,168
...can you give him the files, please?
- Files. Okay.

361
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,044
- What are you doing?
- Files for Garfield.

362
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,679
- Damn it, Allen, this isn't funny.
- Barry, knock it off.

363
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,789
- Allen, you been drinking?
- Drinking? No, I'm not thirsty.

364
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:35,062
I don't know what's going on here, but
I've had it. As of now, you are on report.

365
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,930
I suggest you get your act together
before you find yourself in serious trouble.

366
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,601
I don't like that.

367
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,597
Let go of my hand.

368
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,401
- Allen!
- Barry, cool it, man.

369
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,409
Let me take care of it, okay?
Please, lieutenant.

370
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,483
Your pal is one inch away
from a suspension.

371
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,315
He'll be okay, all right? I promise.

372
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,559
What are you trying to do,
get yourself fired?

373
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:09,223
I don't like it
when people aren't nice to me.

374
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,267
Okay.

375
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,795
Maybe you ought to go home
and get some rest. You look real tired.

376
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,332
Home.

377
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,674
Yeah, home.

378
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,076
I haven't been there before.

379
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,423
This really is the dark side of science.

380
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,958
Toying with nature
with no thought of consequences.

381
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,655
Yes, Dr. Brossell simply copied
me from the DNA in my blood.

382
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,156
It's a real Frankenstein story.

383
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,532
Barry, if Brossell can make one of you,
he could make dozens, hundreds.

384
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:53,075
Just think what they could do. Crimes,
murders, political assassinations.

385
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,611
In the hands of the wrong person,
the possibilities are nightmarish.

386
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,217
- We have to stop him.
- First, we have to stop Pollux.

387
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,320
He's a destructive, deadly force,
and he's out of control.

388
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,325
I feel sorry for him.
He's like an abused child, Barry...

389
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,052
...who's grown up without any love
or moral guidance.

390
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,596
- He's a victim of this experiment too.
- Tina, he's killed a man.

391
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,098
- He would've killed me.
- But there's part of you in him, Barry.

392
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,228
It's possible your morality and goodness
have been genetically encoded in him.

393
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,432
- Lf only we could reach him.
- He has no concept of right or wrong.

394
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,307
If he wants something, he takes it. If
someone gets in his way, he removes them.

395
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,574
He's like a time bomb
just waiting to go off.

396
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,519
I guess you're right.

397
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,484
So where do we start?

398
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,664
Hi, are you my dog?

399
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,400
Good dog.

400
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,340
Don't be afraid. I'm Barry.

401
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:34,774
- <i>Hi, this is Barry. Wait for the beep.</i>
- Hi, this is Barry.

402
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,268
Hi, this is Barry.

403
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,037
- You're right. He's there.
- Lf he wants to be me...

404
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,541
...it was either the lab or my apartment.
I hope we get there in time.

405
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,736
- Maybe we should call the police.
- We can't.

406
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,076
They'd never be able to stop him.
And I can't let them see his face.

407
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,481
Your performance level is down.
I'm not sure you can stop him either.

408
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,451
- I've got to try.
- Well, then take me with you.

409
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,518
All right.

410
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,726
Pollux?

411
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,432
He's gone.

412
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,005
Hey, Earl, come here. Come on.

413
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,166
Come here. Hey, you all right?

414
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,643
Now, the object is to think like him.

415
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,442
What other connection is there
to his life so far?

416
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,212
Intellagen. Let's go.

417
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,766
You're leaving.

418
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,264
Pollux.

419
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,538
You startled me.

420
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,504
I'd lost track of you.

421
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:54,183
- Then you've been looking for me?
- Yes. I was worried about you.

422
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,885
Well, that's comforting.

423
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,622
Everything has just turned out so badly.

424
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,454
I told Whitcomb that we should've
gone slower, you know...

425
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,333
...taken our time.

426
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:15,235
But he's gone now,
and the police don't seem...

427
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:20,503
...to believe what I'm saying is true,
that he died in an accident.

428
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:25,445
- You told the police about me?
- No, of course.

429
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,780
But they keep probing...

430
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:36,819
...and sooner or later...
- Everything will come out.

431
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,426
We can't have that.

432
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,124
Pollux.

433
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,565
Stay away from me.

434
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,693
Look, we don't want to hurt you.
We just want you to come with us.

435
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,101
No!

436
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,269
I won't be locked up again.

437
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,468
I'm not an experiment.
I'm a human being!

438
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,342
Pollux, I know what you're feeling.
I'm you.

439
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,217
I faced the same things
when I got your powers.

440
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,817
- You want to destroy me.
- No.

441
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:44,291
I know you. I know!
You think I'm a freak!

442
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,720
You feel threatened by me.

443
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,664
- You wish me dead.
- Pollux, you're wrong.

444
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,464
I just... I want to be free.

445
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,275
To be someone.

446
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,538
- A person.
- I know.

447
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,305
But your powers are dangerous.

448
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:10,146
- You don't know how to control them.
- I will...

449
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,452
...in time.

450
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,999
- I'm leaving.
- Then I have to stop you.

451
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,628
I understand.

452
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,364
Barry!

453
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,476
Why?

454
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,513
Mask.

455
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,125
- Mask.
- What?

456
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,267
Wanted to see me...

457
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,444
...last time.

458
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,001
What's happening?

459
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:34,890
His metabolic level accelerated so fast
he literally burned himself out.

460
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,346
I'm glad we destroyed
those reconstructed files.

461
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,381
It was a monstrous experiment,
full of tragedy.

462
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,313
Yeah, it was.

463
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,381
But I guess some good came from it.

464
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,656
Tina, I watched myself die.

465
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:05,525
It really brought home what you've
always tried to make me understand.

466
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,857
That I am only a man.

467
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,768
And like all of us,
I'm on a journey of a birth...

468
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,596
...a life...

469
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,767
...and a passing.

470
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,806
Does that make any sense?

471
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,969
Nothing you've ever said
has been clearer or more true.

472
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:29,217
And I know that you've only tried
to make me be careful...

473
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,650
...with the life that I have.

474
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,019
That's right, Barry. Guard it well.

475
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,820
For with you
and the powers you have...

476
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,158
...oh, what a life you'll lead.

477
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,891
