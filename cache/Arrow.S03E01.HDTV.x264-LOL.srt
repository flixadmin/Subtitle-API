1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,050
Last season on
"Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:04,584
This city still
needs saving.

3
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:07,293
Not by the Hood.
It needs a hero.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:09,662
If you survive a crucible,
you grow the stronger for it.

5
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:10,997
This is to remind you of that.

6
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,381
Welcome aboard.

7
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,749
Sara swore
her allegiance

8
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,251
to the league
of assassins.

9
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:16,836
- You agreed to go back?
- She'll be OK.

10
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:18,137
Yeah,
I know she'll be OK,

11
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,672
but OK what is what
bothers me.

12
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:22,058
Dad? Dad!

13
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,596
Slade's whole plan was to take
everything from me. He did.

14
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,981
Slade took Laurel because
he wants to kill the woman I love.

15
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,850
So?
So he took the wrong woman.

16
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:33,936
I love you.
Do you understand?

17
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:40,109
The five years that I was gone,
I wasn't always on the island.

18
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,894
My name is Amanda
Waller, Mr. Queen.

19
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,413
Welcome
to Hong Kong.

20
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,850
Got him.
Coming up 52nd street, heading east.

21
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:08,137
Copy that. Or is it Roger?
I never know the difference.

22
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:11,724
John, there's an illegal
shipment of RPGs headed your way.

23
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,059
Roger. I'm on it.

24
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,894
Oh, so it is Roger.

25
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,246
RPGs are secure.
I've got eyes on.

26
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,248
Roy!

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,883
We're coming to you.

28
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,301
Vincent Steelgrave...

29
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,868
You have failed this city.

30
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:35,869
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 3x01 ♪</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>The Calm</font>
Original Air Date on October 7, 2014

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,870

32
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,630
The Arrow just
took down another

33
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,382
one of the city's
most wanted,

34
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:45,384
and there's no denying that
the city's crime rate

35
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,386
has plummeted
in the past five months.

36
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:48,854
You're welcome.

37
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,639
But so has its unemployment
rate and its population.

38
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,692
We have experienced
two terrorist attacks in as many years.

39
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:56,228
Starling City is dying,
and a prison full of criminals--

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,996
Take another
off the board.

41
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,532
We keep this up, there will only be
two types of criminals

42
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:02,701
left in Starling City--
the ones we put away

43
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:05,287
and the ones that
are running scared.

44
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,322
What's that?

45
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:10,492
A fern.
It thrives on the light.

46
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,127
I thought since you were
living here now,

47
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,879
the place could do
with a little sprucing.

48
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:14,913
I let you buy me a bed.

49
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,748
You were sleeping
on the floor.

50
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,053
Another text
from Thea.

51
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,922
Where is she now?

52
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:25,257
Amalfi coast.

53
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,892
I keep telling her
to send photos.

54
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,393
I'm going to go
do a patrol, clear my head.

55
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,845
Hey.

56
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,397
You did really
good tonight.

57
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,019
I'm going
to head out, too.

58
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,354
I have to pull an early shift
at work today,

59
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:41,940
which may or may not be the most
depressing thing I've ever said.

60
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:43,692
But we're still on
for tomorrow night?

61
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:46,612
Absolutely.
I am going to turn you

62
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:48,447
into corporate
master of the universe.

63
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,449
Those board members
are going to be begging

64
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,918
to sell Queen Consolidated
back to you and your backers.

65
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:58,207
I'm going
to roll out, too.

66
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,927
Lyla has me trying to build
the bassinet from hell.

67
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:05,130
That reminds me...

68
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:11,770
I figured since you and Lyla
are having a girl...

69
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:15,274
Man, you cannot
afford this.

70
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:18,644
I can't afford anything,
which is why I made it.

71
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:22,197
Arrowheads, one of the few things
that I can make.

72
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,449
Well, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

73
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,536
Congratulations, John.

74
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,821
And not just on the baby.

75
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,291
You and Lyla are happy.

76
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,794
Well, you know,
you should try it some time.

77
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:38,547
Last girlfriend, she's in
the League of Assassins.

78
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,582
My girlfriend before that,
she shot my girlfriend before that.

79
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:45,337
I'm not...not exactly
a catch at the moment.

80
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,889
Maybe Felicity will
change all that.

81
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:50,475
It's...It's not the right time.

82
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,178
Things are as good now
as ever will be, Oliver.

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,814
And you love her.

84
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:58,066
You even told her so.

85
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,651
I was trying to fool Slade.

86
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,770
Yes.

87
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:05,023
Except now the only
person you're fooling is yourself.

88
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,995
Thanks again.

89
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:10,422
I told you,
I don't speak Chinese!

90
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:13,642
And I told you,
you try to escape again,

91
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:16,428
I beat you senseless.

92
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:22,100
Steelgrave took
a plea for 15 to 20.

93
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:24,269
His lawyer folded
like a deck chair

94
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,571
after I hit him with
the evidence that the Arrow gathered.

95
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:27,906
Good work.

96
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,442
You catch 'em,
I cook 'em.

97
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:32,577
Did I say that
too loud?

98
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,246
No, you're fine.

99
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:36,365
Did you ever think that we'd
end up as business partners?

100
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,783
Is that why you invited me
down here, Laurel?

101
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,502
To see Mr. Steelgrave
sent off into his new life?

102
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,621
No.

103
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,790
I have a surprise
for you.

104
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,011
What's your dad doing here?

105
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:50,962
You'll see.

106
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:53,131
I'll be right back.
Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,433
Dad.
Hey.

108
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,435
Hi. How are you?

109
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,603
Uh, well, if they had told me press
conferences came with a promotion,

110
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,639
I would tell them I prefer
getting shot at.

111
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,057
Good thing your doctors

112
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,608
didn't give you
a choice, then.

113
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,394
You know, you could
try to hide the fact

114
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,646
that you're glad I can't
get out in the field anymore.

115
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:10,649
I can't hide that I'm glad
that you're safe.

116
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,821
What's all this?

117
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:16,988
Your surprise.

118
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,743
Uh, thank you all--ahem,
excuse me, thank you for coming.

119
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:26,798
Five months ago,
this city was under siege.

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,836
And the SCPD rallied
behind a man in a hood.

121
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,171
Well, I ended up
with a captain's rank,

122
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:36,141
and he didn't even
get a thank you.

123
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:39,561
But today, he does.

124
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:42,347
'Cause today,
the Starling City police department

125
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,733
is formally recognizing
the individual

126
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:47,018
known as the Arrow.

127
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,072
And I'm using
my new position

128
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,991
to disband
the anti-vigilante task force

129
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:54,910
charged
with capturing him.

130
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,661
Thank you.

131
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:59,030
Now make no mistake--
vigilantism will never be tolerated.

132
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,917
But I refuse to hunt,
in the name of this city,

133
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,502
the hero who saved it.

134
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,420
Shut that crap off.
Less heat on the Arrow

135
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,139
means more heat on us.

136
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:10,008
And the ATF now has our shipment
of grenade launchers.

137
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,343
They got our
shipment already?

138
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,044
What are we paying
bribes to the cops for?

139
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:16,932
We have a more
pressing concern.

140
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,967
Lack of leadership.

141
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:21,853
I nominate myself.
Any objections?

142
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,555
Yeah, a few.

143
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:25,774
Oh, illuminate me.

144
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,660
Where do I start?
It's not just that you talk funny.

145
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:30,429
You don't know
the first thing about business.

146
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,564
You're just a low level
street dealer, a pill pusher.

147
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,733
Oh, those pills I push?

148
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:36,985
Are known as Vertigo.

149
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:40,071
In the wake
of the count,

150
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:43,241
I tinkered some
with his formula,

151
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:47,946
introduced an additive produced
by certain mushrooms.

152
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,216
My Vertigo
reveals the face

153
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,251
of your greatest fear.

154
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,895
As I was saying...

155
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,982
Lack of leadership.
I nominate myself.

156
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,401
Any objections?

157
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:15,106
Our course of action
is straight as an arrow.

158
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,526
Gentlemen...

159
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,811
We're going
to kill him.

160
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:22,047
Hey, hey!
How was work?

161
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,884
"It" is not work. It is a soul crushing
exercise in misery

162
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,036
that offers health and dental.
Suffice it to say,

163
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:30,922
I am highly motivated to help convince
the board to sell you back the company.

164
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:34,392
Unfortunately, you don't really have the
qualifications to run Queen Consolidated,

165
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:37,262
but what you do have
is passion.

166
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,831
You care about the company
and the people that work there.

167
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,566
That's what you have
to get across to them.

168
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,134
You got to speak
from the heart.

169
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,304
Felicity...

170
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,974
Would you like to go out to
dinner with me?

171
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,476
I'm being serious here, Oliver.
So am I.

172
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:54,312
I don't want to read...
Too much into this,

173
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:56,231
but are you yoking me
out on a date?

174
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,534
Like an actual date?
Like a...Date-date?

175
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,987
Su--I mean, the implication
being with dinner

176
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,321
that you...
Usually I'm the one

177
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,624
talking in sentence fragments.

178
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,215
Would you like to go
to dinner with me?

179
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:16,301
Yes.

180
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,099
Go.

181
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:24,279
Kelvin Nico just knocked
over a liquor store.

182
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,445
Nico's in Steelgrave's crew.

183
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,866
Send his photo to Roy.

184
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,035
Get me Felicity.
You got it.

185
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,154
I can't
talk right now.

186
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,589
I'm at work.

187
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,926
Could I ask you guys
just to wait one moment?

188
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,629
Someone's calling
for tech support.

189
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:43,315
Oh, you are going to get me
so incredibly fired.

190
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,318
Okay, I am hacked into
the city's database. I am running

191
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,987
- facial recognition...N...
- Do you like Italian?

192
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:50,438
What?
For tonight.

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
You like Italian, right?
Everyone likes Italian.

194
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,526
Oliver, you're in the middle
of a high speed chase.

195
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,495
I'm multitasking.

196
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,030
I got him.
He's in the sewer.

197
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,916
I'm picking up his cell phone
underneath. He's at the corner

198
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,367
of Grand and Ames.

199
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,537
And yes, I love Italian.

200
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,291
Detective Lance-- captain Lance--
is also in pursuit.

201
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,876
You are welcome.
I have to go.

202
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:30,145
Detective...Thank you.

203
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,898
You had it handled.
For what you said today.

204
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,950
I wish I could do more.

205
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,236
You've already done
more than enough. I've got to go.

206
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,487
Some place
I have to be.

207
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,823
You got a hot date
or something?

208
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,994
So this morning
makes how many

209
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,746
escape attempts
in the last five months?

210
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,548
Nine.

211
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,583
What we have here is a failure
to reach an understanding.

212
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,718
Go to hell.

213
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,555
So this is my reward
from saving you from drowning

214
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,723
in that freighter
off the coast of Lian Yu?

215
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,141
Yeah.

216
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,260
Why'd you do that?

217
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,262
That's need
to know.

218
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:08,984
Suffice it to say, I have need
of a man of your capacity.

219
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:12,404
I don't care.

220
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,607
I don't care about anything
except going home.

221
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,692
And you should know that.

222
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:20,078
You should know
that I will never stop

223
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,913
trying to escape.

224
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,448
And you should know that it's
extremely easy to kill someone

225
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,617
the world already
thinks is dead.

226
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,119
Kill me, then.

227
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,005
I don't care.

228
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:32,958
We're going to have to try this
another way, then.

229
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,049
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

230
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,968
Ah, no problem.
I just want to buy this.

231
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,688
This is a satellite frequency
communicator TX40.

232
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,608
Yeah, I'm trying to breach
a torsecured firewall

233
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,059
and I need
something to help me

234
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,194
piggyback off
a keyhole hexagon satellite, so...

235
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,647
I did that once.

236
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,315
Hacked a public
WI-Fi signal,

237
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,451
piggybacked using
crowd-sourced stealth processing.

238
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:00,702
Huh.

239
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:02,737
You're Felicity Smoak.

240
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,323
Formerly of Queen
Consolidated.

241
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,126
Do you mind if I ask you something--
why are you here?

242
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,377
How do you know who I am?

243
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,246
I know a guy
who might be interested

244
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,914
in hiring someone
with your expertise.

245
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,884
I'm not actually...looking
for a new job right now.

246
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,335
God help me.

247
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,670
But I can help you buy this.

248
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,839
Unless I can't.
I mean, I shouldn't.

249
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,140
You shouldn't buy this.

250
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,675
OK. Clearly
you don't understand

251
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,343
how this whole
sales thing works.

252
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:27,562
The next gen model, the TX50,
comes out in a few months.

253
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,681
I got to touch one last year.
Pure bliss.

254
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,816
And if you want to breach
Tor-level security,

255
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,985
you should really
deploy a remote administration tool.

256
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,905
I have a good one.
Here's the URL.

257
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,023
Thanks.

258
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,324
Happy hacking.

259
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:41,159
I certainly hope so.

260
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,165
False alarm.

261
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,001
Are you sure?
These contractions...

262
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,704
Just Braxton-Hicks. You're not
even four centimeters dilated.

263
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,873
I feel like an M1-A1.

264
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,542
It's a tank.
Think a big, big tank.

265
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,377
You did the right
thing coming in.

266
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,545
You don't want
your husband--

267
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,297
boyfriend.
Ex-husband.

268
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,299
To be delivering the baby on the side
of the freeway.

269
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,684
You can
get dressed now.

270
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,686
All right.

271
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,471
Are you OK?

272
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,022
Yeah, yeah, I'm not
the one that's nine months pregnant.

273
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,141
You look a little scared.

274
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,193
Honey, please, I've thrown down
with the Taliban,

275
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,695
Malcolm Merlyn,
and a host

276
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,863
of Mirakuru-powered
human weapons.

277
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,032
I'm terrified.

278
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,431
Queen, party of two.

279
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,276
Hi.
Hi.

280
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,245
Hi.

281
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,085
What?
Nothing.

282
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,754
I'm just--
Nervous?

283
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,005
Yeah.

284
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,007
Line forms behind me.

285
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,092
Scotch. Neat.

286
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,627
Just the water
for me, thanks.

287
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,262
Are you--are you sure?

288
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,097
The booze might sort of
help with the whole--

289
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,517
the alcohol is not going to mix well with
the three benzos I took.

290
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,462
Am I being crazy?

291
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,713
I mean, what do we have
to be nervous about?

292
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,109
Well, we've already
exhausted every topic

293
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,145
that one would normally talk about
on a first date

294
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,479
and a second date
and a third date,

295
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,314
and every date,
actually,

296
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,317
and I've already
seen you shirtless.

297
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,903
Multiple times.

298
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,156
Shirtless,
all the time.

299
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,158
Thank you.
Thank you.

300
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:58,880
There are still a few things
that you don't know about me.

301
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,999
Please. Name one.

302
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,469
The five years that
I was away...

303
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:08,072
I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

304
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,841
I thought so.

305
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,060
Where were you?

306
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:15,597
Hong Kong...for one.

307
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:22,520
And I have been thinking
a lot recently about...

308
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,356
My time there.

309
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,795
The choices
that I had to make.

310
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:35,200
Those years sound like they were full
of a whole lot of suck.

311
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,703
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,873
I'm just a little
out of my element.

313
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,212
The entire time
that I was gone,

314
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,763
I could never...

315
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,799
completely trust someone.

316
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,170
And when that
goes on long,

317
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,005
you stop...

318
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,757
seeing people for people.

319
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,809
You see...

320
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,762
threats.

321
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:08,483
Or targets.

322
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:12,720
And when I decided
to come home, I...

323
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:17,942
I just didn't know
how to turn that part of me off.

324
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:25,250
Then I walked
into your office.

325
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:30,371
You were the first person
that I could see as a...

326
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:33,625
a person.

327
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:39,097
There was just
something about you.

328
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,132
Oh, yeah, I was
chewing on a pen.

329
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:42,550
It was red.

330
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,808
GPS shows him
in the restaurant.

331
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,560
The Arrow's
definitely in there.

332
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:54,646
If we're going to find him,
we got to get in close.

333
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:56,614
We're close enough.

334
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,983
Do you remember when I told you
that because of what we do,

335
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:01,152
I didn't think that

336
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:03,988
I could be with someone
that I...

337
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,325
That I could
really care about?

338
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,710
Yeah, I remember.

339
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,714
So maybe I was wrong.

340
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,675
Oliver, are you--

341
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:25,843
Ollie--

342
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:03,351
Is she OK?

343
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,686
She's just knocked out.

344
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:08,689
Saw it all over the news,
police and fire are on the scene.

345
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,023
Yeah, I didn't think
it was the best idea

346
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,575
to stick around
and answer questions.

347
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:12,910
You don't think you
and an explosion

348
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:14,862
at the same place
is a coincidence?

349
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,205
Hey, check this out.

350
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:19,061
It's a GPS.

351
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:21,335
I found it on your jacket.
It's wasted now.

352
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,203
You took out one
of Steelgraves' crew earlier tonight.

353
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,705
It was a set up

354
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,541
so they could plant
that thing on me.

355
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,209
Oliver, I know
what you're thinking.

356
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,078
No, you don't.
Listen, I'm not other people.

357
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,046
I know exactly what's going on
in your head, and you are wrong.

358
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,882
Diggle, somebody put a tracer on me
and I don't notice?

359
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,217
The only explanation...

360
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,553
I lost my focus.

361
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:43,807
Detective.
The person we took down earlier

362
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,059
is working with whoever's responsible
for tonight's explosion.

363
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,695
Another one of Steelgrave's
crew, I'm guessing.

364
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, I need to know who's
at the top of that organization now.

365
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,901
And where I can find him.

366
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,903
I'm on it.

367
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,243
Hey, hey, hey,
you're safe.

368
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,146
You're safe. I'm here.

369
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:13,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm on your side!

370
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,722
Got this handled, Detective.

371
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:16,974
These guys
blew up a building.

372
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,725
You think
I'm sitting this out?

373
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,427
Suspect's name
is Werner Zytle.

374
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,095
He's a real head case.

375
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,631
Keep your head
on a swivel, then.

376
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,778
I'm Werner Zytle.

377
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,112
Ahh!

378
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,367
You can call me Vertigo.

379
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,952
The Count's dead!

380
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,454
Some things never die.
You, for example.

381
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,840
It's frustrating.

382
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,159
Just means I have to try
a little bit harder.

383
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,462
Ahh!

384
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:01,969
The Count might
be dead, true...

385
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:05,973
But his glorious
narcotic lives on--

386
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,809
with a few enhancements

387
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:12,646
that will reveal to you
your greatest fear.

388
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,699
Like gazing
upon truth itself.

389
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,045
Get away from him
or get put down!

390
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,187
No...No!

391
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:06,116
Felicity, call an ambulance!

392
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,171
Are you OK?

393
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,540
That was a pretty strong psychotropic
Werner hit you with.

394
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,208
How's
detective Lance's condition?

395
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,710
Stable. He's at
starling general.

396
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:25,045
I hacked
the paramedic radio.

397
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,880
He had a coronary
artery spasm

398
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:29,550
treatable with medication.
He'll be fine.

399
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:31,385
How are you?

400
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:35,222
Believe it or not,
I have had worse first dates.

401
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,691
Hit the streets.

402
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:39,159
Werner's agenda
can't stop with me.

403
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,278
I need to know what he has planned.
On it.

404
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,563
I'll back
him up.

405
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,315
Roy's got it.
Go home to Lyla.

406
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:47,901
Oliver...

407
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:50,120
If this is about
what happened, man,

408
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,405
risk is part
of the job.

409
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,740
Diggle. It's just
Intel gathering.

410
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,626
Roy can handle it.

411
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,166
I know we need to talk.

412
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,752
About our dinner or our dinner
getting blown up?

413
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,754
Both.
It's OK.

414
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,290
We'll talk about it
after we catch this guy.

415
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:13,260
But maybe we should
reschedule the board meeting.

416
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:15,679
It's in less
than an hour.

417
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:18,599
I've got this.

418
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,280
When are people going to realize that
I don't speak Chinese?

419
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:34,665
Japanese.

420
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,917
You speak English?

421
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,453
Better than
you speak Chinese.

422
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:42,506
Where am I?

423
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,291
Our home.

424
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,126
Mine and my
husband's.

425
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:49,630
Your husband?

426
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:55,302
Welcome to my home.

427
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:58,305
Dinner?

428
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,762
I got to warn you, the doctors told me
not to get yelled at.

429
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,798
Well, it's a good thing
you don't care about

430
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,199
your doctor's
instructions, then,

431
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,868
since you're still
going out in the field.

432
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,905
Do you know what an advanced
healthcare directive is?

433
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:18,992
It's what they ask for
when you're going to die, dad.

434
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:22,546
The night Sara left,

435
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,831
the night
you collapsed,

436
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,385
the E.R. doctor asked me
if you had one.

437
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,675
I'm sorry, Laurel,
I really am.

438
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,259
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

439
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:40,180
Then why do you keep
pushing yourself like this?

440
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,684
I don't know how.

441
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:48,522
I've been a cop since before you
and your sister were born. It's all I know.

442
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:51,525
If I'm not a cop...

443
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:54,361
What am I?

444
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:59,533
You're my father.

445
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:02,753
And I need you.

446
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:05,038
And I just spoke
to Ned foster.

447
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,923
He said the board is primed.

448
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,542
You just have to go
in there and wow them.

449
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:11,261
Which I am pretty sure
is a business term.

450
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:12,879
I'm afraid we have a situation.

451
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,215
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

452
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,883
Really? Who?

453
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,269
Ray Palmer.

454
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:22,389
Nice to meet you.
Love your company.

455
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:24,891
Nice to see you again,
miss Smoak.

456
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,727
You two know
each other?

457
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,362
So sorry I am late.
Heh, traffic was terrible.

458
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:31,565
Which is why I took
my helicopter.

459
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,734
I parked on your roof.
I hope that's OK.

460
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,569
You guys validate, right?

461
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:39,206
Oh, frack.

462
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,408
Two years ago,
the people of Starling City

463
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,326
thought I was dead.

464
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,712
I came back.

465
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:48,415
And so can
Queen Consolidated.

466
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,001
With Starling National
Bank's new investment,

467
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:55,088
we can take QC out of receivership
and into the future.

468
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,142
I mean,
this company's my family.

469
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:04,898
And as my mother
always said...

470
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,485
There is nothing more important
to me than family.

471
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,937
Thank you.

472
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:21,164
That was
a good speech.

473
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,949
Hard to top.

474
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,453
Thank you all
for coming out today.

475
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:30,123
I promise to be brief,
if not a little entertaining.

476
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,512
Ahh. Oh, that's one
of my new smart watches.

477
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:37,764
I'm very proud of those.

478
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:40,016
You like it,
it works for you?

479
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:44,471
Yeah, good. Anyway.
Science. Numbers.

480
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:50,110
These numbers show
QC's performance

481
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:51,978
under Mr. Queen's
management.

482
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,147
I'm using that term
extremely, b-t-w.

483
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,799
Also b-t-w,
these numbers

484
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,651
aren't sanitized
for Wall Street.

485
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:58,819
This is raw
information

486
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:00,320
from your company's
own servers.

487
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,239
How did he get into
our computers?

488
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,541
Something tells me he deployed
a remote administration tool.

489
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:06,409
But the truth is,

490
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:09,830
this company's woes are a symptom of
a much larger problem.

491
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:13,166
And that problem
is Starling City.

492
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,502
Queen Consolidated
can't hope to survive

493
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:18,672
if the city
it's located in is dying.

494
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:22,008
Guess what? It is.

495
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,678
Nobody wants
to live here anymore.

496
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,396
And after
two terrorist attacks,

497
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,064
who can blame them?

498
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,518
This city
still needs saving.

499
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,521
And that is my vision
for this company.

500
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,023
To not only see it
rise from the ashes,

501
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,744
but to take this city with it
to that new horizon.

502
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,747
And that new day has a name.

503
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:53,089
Oliver!

504
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,624
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:56,877
I really thought
it was going to go our way.

506
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,846
So did I. But maybe the company's
better off with Dr. Palmer.

507
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:01,848
I couldn't make time
for QC last year,

508
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,717
and trying to get the company back now,
it's selfish.

509
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,886
That's something
that the old me would have done.

510
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:08,054
And if the past 12 hours
have reminded me of anything,

511
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:10,857
it's that two years ago, I made
the decision to put Oliver Queen aside

512
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,144
and be the Arrow.
It's not a choice I get to unmake.

513
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,612
Last night at the restaurant,
you didn't feel that way.

514
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,030
Look what happened,
Felicity.

515
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:19,566
Oliver! The explosion
wasn't your fault.

516
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,701
When Werner hit me
with the Vertigo dart,

517
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,737
he told me
that his formula,

518
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:26,957
it shows us
our worst fear.

519
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,492
And I saw myself.

520
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,879
You don't really think
you're afraid of yourself, do you?

521
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,464
I think I'm scared
of what would happen

522
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,716
if I let myself
be Oliver Queen.

523
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:45,970
What did we find out?

524
00:28:45,972 --> 00:28:47,305
You know how we've got
the number of crime bosses

525
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,856
in Starling City
down to three?

526
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:50,975
Well, this new guy, Werner,
he wants to make it zero.

527
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,777
Take out
the competition.

528
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,147
Mikhail Petrov, Luciano Costa,
Shintawa Shimosawa.

529
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,366
What are their
locations?

530
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:01,069
I'm not getting anything
off of last known addresses.

531
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,987
Werner could be
moving these guys right now.

532
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,622
I'm going as fast as I can!
It's not like these guys

533
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:07,158
walk around with little GPSs
attached to them.

534
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,693
Unless they do.

535
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,328
Petrov, Costa, Shimosawa,

536
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,664
they're all on parole
or out on bail.

537
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,332
Ankle monitors.

538
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:16,834
Can't be right.
They're all in the same location.

539
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:21,055
Rockets Arena.
The heavyweight title fight's tonight.

540
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:22,390
That's like Christmas
for crime bosses.

541
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,142
There'll be like
20,000 people there.

542
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:25,560
He was willing to blow up a restaurant
to take down one man.

543
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,228
He'll blow up a stadium
to take down three.

544
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,763
Yeah, but an RPG won't do it.
I need you looking

545
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,598
for a large explosive device.

546
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,583
Roy...suit up.

547
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:36,854
Where do you
want me?

548
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:38,189
Here.

549
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,692
I can't have you
in the field anymore.

550
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:43,411
Really?
What changed?

551
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:44,862
You're going to be a father.

552
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:46,347
Oliver,
you've known for

553
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,199
the past five months
I was going to be a father.

554
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,867
So I ask you again--

555
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,869
what changed?
I have.

556
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,505
My risks can't be your risks.

557
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:57,258
That...Diggle,
you have a life.

558
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,627
You have a new life, it's...

559
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:01,546
Life I can't have.

560
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,347
I get it.

561
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,550
You and Felicity
were in an explosion.

562
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:07,468
People died, either one
of you could have.

563
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,353
But you didn't.

564
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,222
You can't let that
shake you, man.

565
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:12,690
Detective Lance is laying
in hospital bed right now

566
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:14,692
because I let him--
Wait, wait, wait!

567
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,310
Lance is his own man who
makes his own decisions,

568
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:18,446
and so am I.

569
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,064
Not this one.

570
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,899
Oliver, I've given
the last two years

571
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,701
of my life
to your crusade.

572
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:25,570
I don't know what
that's supposed to earn me,

573
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,739
but it earns me at least the right
to make my own choices.

574
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:28,823
No, it doesn't--
damn it, Oliver,

575
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:30,074
you would be dead

576
00:30:30,076 --> 00:30:33,294
ten times over
if it wasn't for me!

577
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,664
You're right.

578
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,834
But this is my crusade,

579
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:42,720
which makes this my decision.

580
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:24,846
Five minute timer.

581
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:32,720
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

582
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:38,226
My partner.

583
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:39,610
Go.

584
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:40,812
I've isolated
a frequency spike

585
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:42,814
consistent with
an incendiary device.

586
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:45,366
It's in the maintenance tunnel
underneath the stands.

587
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:49,537
I'll get the bomb.

588
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:50,988
Get the son
of a bitch.

589
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,586
Back for more?

590
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:12,927
It's as if you've
developed an addiction

591
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,229
to Vertigo.

592
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,699
I've made my choice.

593
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,265
Felicity, we're running
out of time here.

594
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,017
OK. From your description,

595
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,552
it sounds like
a collapsible circuit design.

596
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:56,270
Felicity...

597
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:57,722
Cut the yellow wire.

598
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:01,309
There is no
yellow wire.

599
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,861
OK, new plan.

600
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:05,780
Look above you, there should be
insulated piping

601
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:08,733
pumping the arena's AC system.
They're pumping freon.

602
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:11,235
You want to break one off,
aim it at the bomb.

603
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:13,371
You're going
to freeze the thing.

604
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:44,402
It's not working!

605
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,295
Don't look so surprised.

606
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:14,215
I haven't been gone that long.

607
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:19,971
Lock me down,
it doesn't matter.

608
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:21,973
There will always
be a Vertigo,

609
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:24,692
always someone to
pick up the mantle.

610
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:28,029
You have given it
the power.

611
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,982
Don't you see?

612
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:33,651
Don't you see?

613
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:39,321
You look well.
How's Nanda Parbat?

614
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:41,654
Hot.

615
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,865
It's good
to see you.

616
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,866
You've been missed.

617
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,701
I was on my way
to see Laurel,

618
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,670
picked up
your radio chatter.

619
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,872
You should tell Felicity mix up her
frequencies a bit.

620
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:55,875
That's a good tip.
And is this permanent, you being back?

621
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:58,545
I hope so.

622
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,879
We'll see.

623
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:01,214
How are you doing?

624
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:05,635
I'm...working
through a few things.

625
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,888
Word of advice?

626
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,191
We're not our masks.

627
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:15,445
And we need people in our
lives who don't wear one.

628
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,734
Hey.

629
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,570
What are you
doing here?

630
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:25,572
And the answer
better not be stalking me.

631
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:27,073
Well, that depends
on whether you consider

632
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,909
pinging your phone's GPS
stalking. OK, guilty.

633
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:33,079
But you know how I know a guy
who would be interested

634
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,881
in hiring someone
with your expertise?

635
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,891
Yeah, turns out
I could really use it.

636
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:39,192
Seems somebody hacked
my cell phone and my laptop

637
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:41,528
and my desktop.
Gee, that's too bad.

638
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,398
All my data's been replaced by audio files
of porcupine flatulence.

639
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,368
And so I was hoping
that whoever did it

640
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,903
might be willing
to undo it

641
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:52,789
if I apologized
for misleading them in any way.

642
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,291
That would probably work.

643
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:55,909
Oh, unless, of course,
you did all that

644
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:57,794
to steal that person's
friend's company,

645
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,796
in which case I would suggest
getting used to the sound

646
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:01,915
of spiky rodents farting.

647
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:03,550
I didn't steal anything!

648
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,719
OK, maybe a little,
but as it turns out,

649
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,471
I didn't even need the data.
I mean, you saw the speech.

650
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:08,805
It was a pretty good speech.

651
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:11,224
My friends
just had a baby,

652
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,810
so if you don't mind, there's another
slimy little human that needs my attention.

653
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:15,428
Oh, and b-t-w,

654
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,764
might want to check
your tablet while you're at it.

655
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,270
Hey.

656
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:24,988
Hey.
Hi.

657
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,941
Oh, she is scrumptious!

658
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:30,944
Mazel tov, guys, seriously.

659
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:32,696
Thank you.

660
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:34,781
I can come back.

661
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:37,784
No, Oliver, come in.

662
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,624
Oh, she's perfect.

663
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:46,459
Congratulations.

664
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,380
Thank you, Oliver.

665
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,384
For what?

666
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,136
For being right.

667
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:01,024
The second I looked at her...

668
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,894
Everything changed.

669
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:06,229
The whole universe...

670
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,315
changed.

671
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:13,320
You were right.

672
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,008
How do I get
out of here?

673
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,509
You can't leave.

674
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:39,512
Well, why don't you
try to stop me?

675
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,348
You've already learned I can.

676
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,733
Repeatedly.

677
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:46,736
Amanda Waller wants you
working for her,

678
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:48,521
and she will have her way.

679
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:50,323
Yeah, well, too bad for her.
I'd rather die.

680
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,692
Which is why it's not
your life she's threatening.

681
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:55,195
I am to be responsible for you.

682
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:58,031
She's found the proper way
to motivate me.

683
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,367
Akio.

684
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:05,872
She's threatened my family.

685
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,008
She'll kill them
if I let you go.

686
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,211
My father had a proverb
he was once fond of.

687
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,213
A man cannot live
by two names.

688
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:14,881
And what does that mean?

689
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:17,183
In your case...

690
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:20,387
I believe it means
not having any choice.

691
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,441
Ahh. They look
really happy.

692
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:26,226
She's beautiful.

693
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,395
She is.

694
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:29,946
We need to talk.

695
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:32,232
I don't want
to talk.

696
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:35,285
Which for me, I know, is a little
unprecedented.

697
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:39,239
But...

698
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:41,958
As soon as we talk,
it's over.

699
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,578
I'm so sorry.

700
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,332
I thought that I could be me

701
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,584
and the Arrow...

702
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:54,254
But I can't.

703
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,841
Not now.

704
00:38:57,843 --> 00:39:00,310
Maybe not ever.

705
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:02,929
Then say never.

706
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,265
Stop...

707
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,901
Dangling maybes.

708
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,487
Say it's never going to work out
between us.

709
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,272
Say you never
loved me, say you--

710
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:14,574
Felicity...

711
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,843
Don't ask me
to say that I don't love you.

712
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,799
I told you as soon
as we talked...

713
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:44,971
It would be over.

714
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,315
Hello?

715
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:56,816
It's Barry.

716
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:58,535
Barry Allen.

717
00:39:58,537 --> 00:40:00,820
I woke up.

718
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:03,208
I could use some advice.

719
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,659
I'll be right there.

720
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,380
And here I thought
that you used up

721
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:13,333
all of your League
of Assassin vacation days.

722
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,388
You look great.
How's dad doing?

723
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,924
The same.

724
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,309
Seeing you will help.

725
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:24,094
I don't want him
to know I'm in town,

726
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:26,179
not just yet.

727
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:28,849
You don't want him
to know you're in town,

728
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:31,268
or you don't want him
to know why?

729
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,737
Both.

730
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,573
This life, it...

731
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:39,860
It's complicated.

732
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,695
We didn't want you
to choose it.

733
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:43,747
Not for us.

734
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:46,366
I know.
I chose it for me.

735
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:51,788
The Arrow--

736
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,373
Oliver--

737
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:57,594
busted someone who tried
to blow up Rockets Arena.

738
00:40:57,596 --> 00:40:59,963
And my boss wants me
to head to the station

739
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,882
to backstop the interrogation.

740
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:04,384
Laurel Lance.

741
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,053
Always trying
to save the world.

742
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:07,638
Runs in the family.

743
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:12,059
Love you.

744
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:24,071
Hello, Sara.

745
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:29,960
What are you
doing here?

746
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,093
Oh! No!

747
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:47,678
No! Sara!

748
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,013
Sara!

749
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:54,267
No, no!

750
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,107
Please!

751
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:07,896
