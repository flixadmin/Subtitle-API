2
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,583
Thanks.

3
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Walk towards the music, Cristoff.

4
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,375
Towards the music.

5
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,666
Music.

6
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,416
Music.

7
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Music.

8
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:04,291
Music... music.

9
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,166
Music.

10
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,583
This is Bear 3.

11
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,041
Emergency in Room 1.
I need immediate replacement in Room 1.

12
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,833
Copy, Bear 3. On my way.

13
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,291
Music.

14
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Excuse me.

15
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,375
Excuse me. I'm a doctor.
I think this gentleman doesn't feel well.

16
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,250
He's disoriented.
It's nothing serious. Thanks.

17
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
Come on, Dad.

18
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,958
Excuse me. Out there...

19
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,958
He crossed the line with some ladies.

20
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,666
What?

21
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,583
The president of the foundation
almost called the police.

22
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
What did he do?

23
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,083
He said

24
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,541
inappropriate things.

25
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,625
What things?

26
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,000
About...

27
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,666
genitals.

28
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,458
Did you see if he was
with someone or how he got here?

29
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,625
Move aside.

30
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,666
Come here, Dad.

31
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,208
Excuse me.

32
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,875
