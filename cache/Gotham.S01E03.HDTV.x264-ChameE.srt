1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:02,148
<i>Cobblepot: There's a war coming.</i>

2
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:03,975
<i>A terrible war.</i>

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,042
<i>There will be chaos,</i>

4
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:06,744
<i>rivers of blood in the streets.</i>

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:07,645
I know it!

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,533
I-I-I can see it coming.

7
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:11,124
<i>It's time. Somebody has to take over.</i>

8
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,360
<i>It might as well be me.</i>

9
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:14,944
(Bruce screaming)

10
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,779
<i>My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

11
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,147
I will find the man who did this.

12
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,150
<i>Pepper was framed by
Fish Mooney and the cops.</i>

13
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,085
James Gordon is not a good
guy. You deserve better.

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,887
<i>Gordon: Don't ever come back to Gotham.</i>

15
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,311
<i>I spoke with Cobblepot before he died.</i>

16
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,758
<i>Men who are about to die are very honest.</i>

17
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:32,860
<i>Mooney: I am gonna kill that old man.</i>

18
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>I just wish Penguin was still alive.</i>

19
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:38,072
<i>Selina: I've been watching you.</i>

20
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,065
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

21
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:51,645
(Siren blaring, crowd chatter)

22
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,118
Excuse me! Uh!

23
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,786
Man: Hey! Yo!

24
00:00:58,821 --> 00:00:59,854
Officer: Lay it on me.

25
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:09,964
Thank you. (Woman yelling)

26
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,332
Woman: Stop him!

27
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,935
Ooh! You need some...?

28
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,704
Home.

29
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,938
(Chuckles)

30
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,708
TV announcer: And let's go
live for some breaking news...

31
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,109
Thank you, Jason.

32
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,811
I'm coming to you with the latest wrinkle

33
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,346
in a story that sent shockwaves

34
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,447
through the financial world of Gotham.

35
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:28,949
I'm standing before the
home of Ronald Danzer,

36
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,618
the man who bilked investors out of

37
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,119
a reported half billion dollars

38
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,487
in a vast Ponzi scheme.

39
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,890
Danzer is currently out
on bail awaiting trial.

40
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,893
All of them-- the judge,
the jury, the D.A.--

41
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,295
pay them whatever it takes.

42
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,197
I am not going to prison just because

43
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,565
a few dumb bus drivers

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,235
and stupid old ladies
lost their damn pensions.

45
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,171
(Sighs) I got to sneak out.

46
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,506
The villagers are here with pitchforks.

47
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,642
You're my lawyer.

48
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,444
Fix this!

49
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:01,215
Balloons!

50
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,783
Balloon...!

51
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:06,654
Here, balloons!

52
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,757
- Want a balloon?
- What?

53
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,127
- No. No, thank you. No.
- Ronald Danzer?

54
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:15,663
Who are you?

55
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:26,207
(Yelling)

56
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,775
Help me!

57
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,677
That's Ronald Danzer. Roll the camera!

58
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,078
Roll the camera!

59
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:33,981
Help me...!

60
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,788
In a bizarre turn of events,

61
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:44,158
a man appearing to be
Ronald Danzer is rising

62
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:47,228
into the air above Gotham, attached to...

63
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:48,596
A weather balloon.

64
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,631
(Yelling)

65
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:02,276
Cart was loaded with bricks for ballast.

66
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,445
So, Ronald Danzer

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,380
cheats half of Gotham out of their savings,

68
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:07,882
but before he can stand trial,

69
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,783
an unknown man clips him to a balloon?

70
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,619
No body?

71
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:14,622
- We calling this a murder?
- Call it a public service.

72
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:17,057
Danzer was a bum. He got what he deserved.

73
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,427
I'm gonna go get a Danish.
It's what I deserve.

74
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,268
<i>Man: Damn it!</i>

75
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:29,270
Somebody find me O'Brian!

76
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,472
And get me some ice!

77
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,544
- Who the hell are you?
- Jim Gordon.

78
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,547
Jim Gordon. You're
bullock's new partner, hey?

79
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:43,484
Yeah. Lieutenant bill Cranston.

80
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,753
Yeah, bullock tells me
you're a real boy scout.

81
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,988
Don't think we should
be roughing up the skels?

82
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,523
Well, they do have their rights.

83
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,058
I'm gonna have to remember that.

84
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,927
Maybe I'll get that tattooed on my ass.

85
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,194
(Laughs)

86
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,663
Let me show you something, Gordon.

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,033
This was a gift

88
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,802
from the Gotham chamber of
commerce for years of service.

89
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:03,470
I call him O'Brian.

90
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:10,311
He also just happens to be the
best interrogator on the force.

91
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:12,580
Nice meeting you, Gordon.

92
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:17,551
Oh, Luke, say hello to sergeant O'Brian.

93
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:18,919
Luke: No! No!

94
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:21,956
(Luke yelling)

95
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,727
I just met lieutenant Cranston.

96
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,430
- The man, the myth, the legend.
- He's a thug.

97
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,966
So, no fingerprints, and those carts

98
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,701
are too easy to buy or steal to trace.

99
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,603
How you coming on those death threats?

100
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:37,271
I thought we talked about this.

101
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,907
Ronald Danzer was murdered.
It's our job to catch murderers.

102
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,508
The guy was a crook.

103
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,910
Who had not been convicted of any crime.

104
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,845
Tell that to the two
guys who killed themselves

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
because he lost their life savings.

106
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,349
This guy was living high for 30 years

107
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:50,551
while the city kissed his
ass and gave him awards

108
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:51,986
for being such a philanthropist.

109
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,487
So we just let his killer go free.

110
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:56,457
Guy walks in here, holds out
his hands, I'll arrest him.

111
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,959
Otherwise, I'm content justice was served.

112
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:00,394
Like with the Waynes?
Is that what you mean?

113
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,463
Mario pepper killed the Waynes.

114
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:05,532
We killed pepper. That case is closed.

115
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,768
Detective Gordon?

116
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,436
Davis Lamond from juvenile services?

117
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:12,606
You asked to see Selina Kyle.
Could you sign for custody?

118
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:13,974
And when you finish,

119
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,143
you can bring her to our
new facility on water street.

120
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:18,579
She's scheduled to be
transferred upstate tomorrow.

121
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,780
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.

122
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,788
She has information about an investigation.

123
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:26,220
Would you mind... stepping...
Back... a bit, please?

124
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:27,688
Wait a minute.

125
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,990
Is that one of the kids that was snatched?

126
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:32,326
Another closed case.

127
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,995
What is it about the word
"closed" you don't understand?

128
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,563
This is something else.

129
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,565
Just read the letters, track the balloons.

130
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,767
I'll be back in an hour.

131
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:43,378
Yeah, boss. Get right on it.

132
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,380
Where's my pen?

133
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:47,382
<i>Selina: So why do you care</i>

134
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,217
who really killed the Waynes?

135
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,753
Because I want the person
responsible brought to justice.

136
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:54,889
(Scoffs) Did you read that
in a book or something?

137
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,926
And...

138
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,395
I made a promise to the boy.

139
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,030
So?

140
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,566
The killer came from there.

141
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,636
Took the man's wallet
and the woman's necklace.

142
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,705
Then shot them both.

143
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,607
He left the boy alive.

144
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,642
I was up there.

145
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,646
Everybody knows that much.

146
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,249
Plus, the killer's face was covered.

147
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:22,550
Not at first.

148
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,185
He pulled up his scarf when

149
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,020
he walked toward them.
I saw him for a second.

150
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,089
You saw him... Here... in the dark?

151
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,757
I can see in the dark.

152
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,294
You don't believe me.

153
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,064
There's a question of whether
you're lying about what you saw,

154
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,399
and then there's the question
of whether you were even here.

155
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:40,201
- You're not giving me proof.
- I just told you,

156
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,470
I stole some chump's wallet
just before it happened.

157
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,239
That was, like, two blocks from here.

158
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,306
Didn't he report it?

159
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,208
Yes, a man did report

160
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,776
his wallet stolen by a thief

161
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,545
that matches your description, and, yes,

162
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,747
the timing does work out to just
before the Waynes were murdered.

163
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:54,215
But that does not place you here.

164
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:55,950
I dumped the wallet.

165
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,319
There.

166
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,270
The sewer. Great.

167
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,995
It's not that I don't
trust you not to run away.

168
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,064
But, well... I don't.

169
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,969
You find the wallet,
you'll let me go, right?

170
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:16,571
- That's the deal.
- No.

171
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:19,407
Find the wallet, that places you here.

172
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,075
We still have to find the guy.

173
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,911
- That's bull!
- That's the deal.

174
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,063
(Water dripping)

175
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,368
(Groaning)

176
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:49,404
Oh, great.

177
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,849
(Groans)

178
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,122
Son of a bitch. She was telling the truth.

179
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,492
Selina: Oh, detective?

180
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,663
You're gonna need these.

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,299
Hey!

182
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,401
Hey, wait a minute!

183
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:22,403
(Groans, yells)

184
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,543
(Sighs)

185
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,778
Lazlo, honey,

186
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,780
take a rest.

187
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,749
Poor thing.

188
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,752
Well, well, well.

189
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:40,188
Detectives Montoya and Allen.

190
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:42,123
To what do I owe this honor?

191
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,258
Thought we'd pay our respects.

192
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:47,328
Maybe ask if you'd seen
your friend Cobblepot around.

193
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:50,732
Hmm. Oswald. Hmm.

194
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,900
Now that you mention it, I haven't

195
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:54,769
seen him.

196
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:57,138
Isn't that funny?

197
00:08:57,173 --> 00:09:00,008
Almost as funny as two
detectives from Major Crimes

198
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:02,510
looking for a nobody like Oswald.

199
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,512
Can we stop the dance?

200
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,481
He's dead, isn't he?

201
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,282
He was killed 'cause he told us

202
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:10,251
about pepper being framed
for the Wayne murders.

203
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:11,819
He's dead.

204
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,457
But I didn't kill the little snitch.

205
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:19,994
Word is, Jim Gordon pulled the trigger.

206
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,899
You have proof?

207
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,068
What do I look like, a cop?

208
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,569
I only heard

209
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:32,006
that James Gordon splattered
poor Oswald's brains

210
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,541
all over Gotham river.

211
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:36,644
Why would Gordon want
to murder Cobblepot? Huh?

212
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,379
Just to keep him quiet about the frame?

213
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:40,581
Wrong question, gorgeous.

214
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,653
Jim Gordon pulled the trigger,
but who gave the order?

215
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:50,758
Who could make a cop
commit cold-blooded murder?

216
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,094
Falcone.

217
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,398
Your deductive powers astonish me.

218
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:59,400
Honestly, I just got a chill.

219
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,769
You know, there's a rumor going around that

220
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:06,040
Falcone gave your latest
boy-toy a nasty beating.

221
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,976
You wouldn't be looking for a
little revenge, now, would you?

222
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:12,947
I just want justice for little Oswald.

223
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,661
Man: Hey, Cobblepot.

224
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,563
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

225
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,531
(With Russian accent): I'm
afraid you have me confused.

226
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,633
My name is Dimitri from Odessa.

227
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,635
I-I heard you got whacked for ratting.

228
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,137
Yeah, Fish is gonna pay

229
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,772
some serious cash for your skinny ass.

230
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,107
No, no, no, no! No, please!

231
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,441
Please, please, she'll kill me!

232
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:42,110
Why'd you even come back, huh? Huh?

233
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,779
I-I could not stay
away. Gotham is my home!

234
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,080
It's my destiny!

235
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,882
You don't see what's coming! I do!

236
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,717
Gotham needs me! I am its future!

237
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:52,420
If you're its future, then
Gotham is in big trouble.

238
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,355
Yes. Yes, it is.

239
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,893
(Shouting)

240
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,511
Can I have a tuna sandwich, please?

241
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,943
<i>- Don't want to do this.
- Alfred: What?</i>

242
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,546
- Stop. I don't want to do this. Stop.
- Come on. Swat.

243
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,915
En garde.

244
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,250
There you go, son. What? What?

245
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,653
- Is that all you got?
- I'm not... doing this.

246
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:39,855
- Uh... what?
- (Chuckles)

247
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,724
There she blows,

248
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,792
the eye of the tiger through the wind

249
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,195
in your nostrils, sir Bruce,

250
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,864
the blood in his veins.

251
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,200
That's it. Mind your head!

252
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:52,301
(Alfred yells)

253
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,969
I do beg your pardon, sir. I'm most...

254
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,772
Oi! Might be the bat.

255
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,207
Blood's up. (Grunts)

256
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,942
And hyah!

257
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:02,074
(Grunts)

258
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,212
That's got to hurt. No, not really.

259
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,146
Ooh.

260
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,749
I said stop!

261
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,485
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

262
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,686
Stop. Down swords.

263
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,188
I surrender.

264
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:15,057
(Alfred panting)

265
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,559
- (Chuckles)
- See?

266
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:18,594
A nice...

267
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,663
Sword fight gets your blood up,

268
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,499
doesn't it?

269
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,035
Better than reading these dusty old files.

270
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,238
What is this, anyway?

271
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:30,672
Police file.

272
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,675
About your mom and dad.
How'd you get these?

273
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,512
Wasn't-wasn't hard.

274
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,081
Why would you want to look
at these? They're horrible.

275
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,350
They're gonna give you nightmares.

276
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,852
I-I have those, anyway, and...

277
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,654
I'm looking for clues.

278
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,089
What, so you're a detective now, are you?

279
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:48,390
If I find a clue I am.

280
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:49,525
Have you found a clue?

281
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,396
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

282
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,601
Now, detective Gordon has promised you

283
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,403
that he will find the person
that killed your parents.

284
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,872
Do you really believe he will?

285
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,874
He will try.

286
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,010
Of that I am certain.

287
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,815
Yeah. Detective James Gordon.

288
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,917
One of your counselors
brought me a girl this morning,

289
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,052
and I signed for custody.

290
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,554
That's what I'm saying.

291
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,422
I can't bring her back. She got away.

292
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,460
Yeah? Well, I'm not happy about it either.

293
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,463
On edge, Gordon?

294
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm fine. How can I help you?

295
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:34,269
We were just, uh, wondering

296
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:37,039
when you shot Cobblepot in the head

297
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,707
and dumped his body in the river,

298
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,642
did Falcone pay you?

299
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,946
Or was that more of a "favor
to the don" type thing?

300
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:51,104
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

301
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,973
Oh, so you mean you didn't kill Cobblepot?

302
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,476
Or you didn't do it for Falcone?

303
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,611
We thought we'd give you a
chance to tell us the truth.

304
00:13:58,647 --> 00:13:59,946
Cop to cop.

305
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,915
You're not listening. I didn't kill him.

306
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,885
Okay, so where were you on the
night of September the 17th?

307
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,554
Are you really asking me this?

308
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,889
Since when did Major Crimes become I.A.?

309
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,125
When cops started doing hits for the mob.

310
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,794
Yeah? Well, come back to me
when you have actual proof.

311
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,963
Until then, don't waste my time.

312
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:18,839
Hey, Gordon, piece of advice:

313
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,468
Take a shower. 'Cause
you stink like a sewer.

314
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,441
Any job at all. Even dishwasher.

315
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:29,442
We're staffed up.

316
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,911
I only ask a chance to prove myself.

317
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,313
You ever work in a restaurant?

318
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,315
Not exactly...

319
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,716
Here, you're on your feet all day.

320
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,785
You don't even have the right shoes.

321
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,821
(Plates clatter)

322
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,596
Bullock: There you are.

323
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,064
I got the owner of a
weather balloon factory

324
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,466
downstairs, says he's got something for us.

325
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,135
Montoya and Allen came by.

326
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,905
- Accused me of killing Cobblepot.
- Damn.

327
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,506
- Somebody must've talked.
- Doesn't matter.

328
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,108
The fact they're here
means they got nothing,

329
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,576
and they're gonna get nothing.

330
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,946
End of the day, no one
cares about Cobblepot.

331
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,915
Because he deserved it. Like Ronald Danzer.

332
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,377
Don't make this into something bigger.

333
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,151
You did what you had to do.

334
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:13,419
And, yes, he probably did deserve it.

335
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,840
He worked for Fish. She
doesn't employ altar boys.

336
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,991
What about Mario pepper?
He deserve what he got?

337
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:18,992
Hell, yes.

338
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:22,795
He was a dirtbag. He tried
to shoot you, remember?

339
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,931
And I thought we were
done talking about this.

340
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,399
We're done talking about this

341
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:27,934
when the person who actually murdered

342
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,536
Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail,

343
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,705
not the person we killed for it.

344
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:35,508
For the last time, Gordon, let it go.

345
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,976
Or what?

346
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,312
Am I gonna be the next
person taken out to the pier

347
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:40,680
to get a bullet in the head?

348
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,851
The interview's waiting.

349
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,531
Pardon me.

350
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,733
You work at that Italian
restaurant across the way,

351
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,201
- don't you?
- Yeah.

352
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:05,371
And what size are your shoes?

353
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,640
Uh, nines.

354
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,642
What a coincidence!

355
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,645
(Laughing)

356
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,080
When I saw that balloon go up on TV,

357
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:15,481
I knew it was one of mine,

358
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,983
and I said to myself, "Jimmy boy,

359
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,384
"you better call the cops right away,

360
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,820
or they'll try and pin this on you."

361
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,155
So it was you who called us.

362
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,690
And here I thought my partner had gone

363
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,024
to the trouble of tracking you down.

364
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,141
How exactly was one of your
balloons used to kill Ronald Danzer?

365
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,464
It was stole by my bum of
an ex-employee a month ago.

366
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,266
Carl Smikers.

367
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,201
That's what I get for hiring a kid.

368
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,837
- Did he ever mention Danzer?
- Hell, no.

369
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,340
I'm surprised he even knew who Danzer was.

370
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,674
We ain't talking about

371
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,278
one of those intellectually
superior types here.

372
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:46,179
You got an address?

373
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,915
Yeah, but you find him, see
you can get back the others.

374
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,184
- The other what?
- The other balloons.

375
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,519
A grand a pop those things are.

376
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,921
He stole four.

377
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,725
(Grunts, coughs)

378
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:03,563
$47? Frankie, I'm coming back next week.

379
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,498
Try to show some initiative, all right?

380
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,167
Okay. Bill.

381
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,737
You're a disgrace to drug dealers.

382
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,116
- Hot dog?
- Get lost.

383
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,817
- Hot dog?
- I said get lost!

384
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:25,918
Lieutenant Cranston?

385
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,121
(Grunting)

386
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,092
(Grunts) (Moaning)

387
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,928
All right.

388
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,164
(Grunts)

389
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,268
Let's see... Huh? Huh?

390
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:44,070
Let's see what we got here.

391
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,674
What the hell?

392
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,478
Who are you?

393
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:54,914
(Grunting)

394
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,284
(Air hissing)

395
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:01,921
Oh, no.

396
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,456
(Grunting)

397
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:06,626
(Cranston shouts)

398
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:09,362
No! No!

399
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:12,999
No! No! No!

400
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,802
(Cranston sobbing)

401
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:16,803
No!

402
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,472
(Sobbing)

403
00:18:28,452 --> 00:18:30,452
Right.

404
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:34,623
So no breakfast then?

405
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,958
And no dinner last night?

406
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,438
What's the new program?

407
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:43,209
Trying to see how long we can
go without eating anything?

408
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,678
Right. If that's the case, I
should save myself the trouble

409
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,814
of making it.

410
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,171
Have you seen this?

411
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,519
Oh, yeah, yeah. That nutter going around

412
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,921
offing people with balloons.

413
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:58,157
I can think of easier ways to kill someone.

414
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,826
Master Bruce, forgive me for...

415
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:04,564
Uttering the tired old
words "in times like these,"

416
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,234
but in times like these,

417
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,603
you really need to keep your strength up.

418
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:15,174
I'm just not hungry.

419
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,359
Morning.

420
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,695
Hi. Thank you.

421
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,363
I tried not to wake you.

422
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:39,632
It's fine. I have a meeting.

423
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,168
Mm. You okay?

424
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:43,502
You hardly slept last night.

425
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,037
(Sighs) Just work.

426
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:46,772
This Balloonman thing?

427
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,775
That's what the paper's calling him.

428
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,779
And it says he killed a cop.

429
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,116
You're not in danger, are you?

430
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,218
You don't have to worry about me.

431
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:00,820
Well, what is it then?

432
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,788
I can see something's bothering you.

433
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:04,957
Yesterday,

434
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:08,194
the first victim, Ronald Danzer,

435
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:11,078
was a con man. Nobody cared.

436
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:13,703
Now that a cop's been targeted,

437
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,638
the investigation will get
all the support it needs.

438
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,507
It's not right.

439
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,909
Everyone has to matter or nobody matters.

440
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:22,111
Otherwise people lose faith.

441
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:24,614
That's when you get vigilantes.

442
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,282
But that isn't your fault.

443
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:29,385
I mean, if anything,
you're giving people faith.

444
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,522
Am I? How?

445
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:35,758
Your first case, you
caught the Wayne killer.

446
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:41,297
Do you have any idea what
that meant for the city?

447
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,633
You're a hero.

448
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:47,470
I gotta go.

449
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:55,044
<i>Man: Don't matter if you a cop. You dirty,</i>

450
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,379
the Balloonman gonna get you.

451
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:58,381
It's time the people of Gotham realize

452
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,650
that they have to stand up for themselves.

453
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,819
Hey, Balloonman ought to
get to my landlord next.

454
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:07,089
He's a crook. And his name is Harold bl...

455
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,091
This is wonderful. This is like...

456
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:11,260
My dream of how today was gonna go.

457
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:12,762
Besides the black eye to the department,

458
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:15,485
now we have a vigilante who kills bad cops.

459
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,433
Cranston wasn't that bad.

460
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,135
But whatever he was or wasn't guilty of,

461
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,604
Cranston was a lieutenant in the GCPD.

462
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,673
You don't get to go around killing cops.

463
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,168
So where are you on this
and the Danzer murder?

464
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,044
We're looking for a man named Carl Smikers.

465
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,545
He was an employee at the factory

466
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,414
where the balloons were stolen.

467
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:32,915
We have uniforms staking out his apartment,

468
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,684
but he hasn't been back
there since last night.

469
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,186
- And you like him for this?
- Oh, he's guilty.

470
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:39,088
Leave me in a room with
him, he'll be guilty.

471
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,090
He's definitely connected,
but I'm not sure he's the one.

472
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,325
He had weather balloons!

473
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,993
Cranston and Danzer were
killed with weather balloons!

474
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,161
He's the guy!

475
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,330
Smikers never graduated high school.

476
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:50,099
He's never held a job for more
than a year, he's got busts

477
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,334
for soliciting, possession.

478
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:53,202
Tell her about the other balloons.

479
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,004
What other balloons?

480
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,474
Smikers' boss mentioned that
four balloons are missing.

481
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,276
There are two of them still out there.

482
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,311
So two more targets?

483
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:04,280
We have any sense who they might be?

484
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,549
Danzer and Cranston
were both known figures,

485
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,284
and known to be dirty.

486
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,753
Killer didn't need any special
knowledge to target them,

487
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,989
so, it's likely the next target is public

488
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,457
and known to be corrupt.

489
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:15,891
Basically, every elected official

490
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,827
in Gotham should stay indoors.

491
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,863
Find him. Now.

492
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:24,367
<i>- We will.
- We will?</i>

493
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:26,802
What happened to the killer
doing the city a favor?

494
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,671
You're gonna make me
think you actually care.

495
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,806
Listen, smartass, you want
to kill a corrupt financier,

496
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:31,941
be my guest.

497
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,644
You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.

498
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,045
- We need a plan.
- Relax.

499
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,181
One thing I do know is how to find someone.

500
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,754
Maybe later tonight.

501
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:04,306
Here you go. Beautiful, baby.

502
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,175
There you go. Hmm?

503
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:12,214
Hey!

504
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,750
Hey! Yo!

505
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:16,452
What did he tell you?

506
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,788
Nothing. I was just hungry.

507
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,823
Oh! Mmm!

508
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,730
Here's the deal: You wash dishes,

509
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,465
mop the floor, take out the trash.

510
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,635
Otherwise, you're deaf, dumb and blind.

511
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,938
- I understand.
- No, you don't, but you will.

512
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,140
This ain't like other places,
and you'll either get it...

513
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:40,376
Or I'll be fired?

514
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:42,378
You could say that.

515
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:44,313
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

516
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,949
I know that this is a great opportunity.

517
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:50,052
(Laughs) Don Maroni!

518
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,153
Good to see you.

519
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:52,154
Doing good? Welcome. Welcome.

520
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,889
All right.

521
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,459
Great. A great opportunity, indeed.

522
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:01,497
So, our suspect had a prior for
soliciting two years ago, right?

523
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,933
So, one of my girls
thought he looked familiar,

524
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,501
remembered he liked big, brawny types.

525
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:07,503
So, she pointed me to that pimp,

526
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,371
that guy who specialized in that.

527
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,774
- He remembered...
- After you roughed him up a little.

528
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,375
...that he used to do deliveries

529
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,112
for this, uh, dry cleaner, Mr. Chang.

530
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,780
And he remembered, on
top of everything else,

531
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:19,181
the guy was a mahjong guy.

532
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:21,517
He was into these Chinese
bookies for, like, five grand.

533
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:22,752
Gordon: And they sent you here.

534
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,120
By way of some bike messengers,

535
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:26,188
the guy that runs
pickpockets on the south side,

536
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:29,091
and a pot sticker joint
the guy apparently loved.

537
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,394
Dragon palace.

538
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:36,165
- We didn't order any...
- Carl Smikers?

539
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:41,170
- Run!
- (Grunting)

540
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:43,606
GCPD! You're under arrest!

541
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,341
(Grunting, yelling)

542
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:52,047
Stop, or I'll... (Yells)

543
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,817
Don't move.

544
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:58,354
Jim, a little help!

545
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,689
Put it down!

546
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:02,792
Put it down now!

547
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,661
(Thudding, crashing)

548
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:22,558
<i>You put the MCU onto
that cop killing Oswald.</i>

549
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:25,561
Falcone finds out it
came from you... I mean,

550
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:28,864
I don't mind what he did to me, it's, uh...

551
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,133
Lazlo, honey,

552
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:33,435
you're worried about me, aren't you?

553
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,680
But you must remember,

554
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:43,684
it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt.

555
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,986
It was me.

556
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:48,522
Understand?

557
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:59,867
(Clicks tongue)

558
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:05,873
The boy's lost his spine. (Wry laugh)

559
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:08,275
Not everyone's built
for a beating like that.

560
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:12,479
What's that new piece that
the Roman's been seeing--

561
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:14,948
what's her name--
Natalia? Nadia?

562
00:26:14,984 --> 00:26:16,850
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

563
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:19,720
Tell butch she's going to have an accident.

564
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:21,789
Such a shame.

565
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,391
She was a pretty girl.

566
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:27,261
And get rid of Lazlo while you're at it.

567
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,029
He's bringing down the mood.

568
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:31,398
With pleasure.

569
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,309
My God!

570
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,077
Sorry. I knocked, but I could
hear someone in here, and...

571
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,747
- How did you get in?
- I still have a key, remember?

572
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:48,649
And you just let yourself in?

573
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,584
Give it to me.

574
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,619
I could have you arrested.

575
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:55,556
Or I could arrest you.

576
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,091
It's kind of early to get high, isn't it?

577
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,494
It's been a stressful day.

578
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:01,728
And is that all you're doing?

579
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:04,765
Afraid so. Disappointed?

580
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
Don't play with me, Barbara.

581
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,035
I was there, remember?

582
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,237
- Through all of it.
- Don't you mean you were a part of it?

583
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,239
Fine.

584
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:16,043
- Answer the question.
- Yes. This is it.

585
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,946
And now that you've broken
into my home and accused me

586
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:21,081
of being a drug addict, you can leave.

587
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,382
Not until we talk about Gordon.

588
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,550
(Scoffs) He's killed a man.

589
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:25,018
You told me. It's not true.

590
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,020
Not Mario pepper, another man.

591
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:30,224
And he killed him on the
orders of carmine Falcone,

592
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,558
biggest crime boss in Gotham.

593
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:33,627
You're lying.

594
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:37,243
But, you know, I guess
I should be used to that.

595
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,279
True.

596
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:42,182
When we were together, I did lie to you.

597
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:46,619
A lot. But you always knew.

598
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:50,890
You looked in my eyes, and you
knew when I was lying to you.

599
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,723
Am I lying now?

600
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,694
Is it just because I love him?

601
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:04,699
Is that why you are so
determined to destroy him?

602
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:07,001
I've been sober for a year.

603
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,371
Look, and I know that doesn't
erase the things that I did.

604
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,409
But I still care about you.

605
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,512
I can't stand you being with this man.

606
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:21,215
You deserve better.

607
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:30,558
Leave.

608
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:35,496
Now.

609
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,137
Ask him where he was the night

610
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:45,072
that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

611
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:48,242
That's the name of the man he killed.

612
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,584
I-I'm telling the truth,
I didn't kill those guys.

613
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:59,520
I mean, a cop?! Why would I kill a cop?!

614
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,690
Maybe because you're a thieving,
cop-murdering pile of crap.

615
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,458
But, mind you, that's just a theory.

616
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,227
You admit stealing the balloons.

617
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:08,229
Yeah. Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks,

618
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:10,965
and-and if I didn't pay 'em,
they were gonna cut off stuff.

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,934
So if you didn't kill
Danzer and Cranston, who did?

620
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,904
- Who'd you sell the balloons to?
- I never saw his face.

621
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,974
We had a drop-off point to
exchange the balloons and money.

622
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,411
You know what we got here,
Jim? We got us a criminal

623
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:25,780
mastermind, hmm? Not only

624
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,548
is the murder weapon in the stratosphere,

625
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,117
but so are the bodies.
It's the perfect crime!

626
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:32,620
The bodies will come back.

627
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,491
What are you talking about?

628
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,927
Do you guys not know how
weather balloons work?

629
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:42,830
Tell us, genius, or
I'll beat it out of you.

630
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,098
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

631
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,633
They-they rise
up, and-and it gets

632
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:48,335
colder and colder, and
the balloon gets brittle,

633
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,937
and the helium expands.

634
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,172
Then what?

635
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,007
It pops.

636
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:01,816
(Dog whining, barking)

637
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:03,484
(Thudding) Woman: Oy...

638
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:08,289
Bullock: I'm really starting
to dislike this case.

639
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:11,959
Where do you think they
find shovels that big, huh?

640
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:13,894
We only have to worry
about one more balloon.

641
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,563
- Who?
- Cardinal Quinn.

642
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,198
He was meditating in his garden.

643
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,133
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

644
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:21,502
Now we're gonna have the
church on our back. Great.

645
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:22,770
Forget the fact

646
00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:25,639
that Quinn was known
as the diddling priest.

647
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,641
Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.

648
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,844
What wasn't smashed to bits.

649
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,614
Why's your name on this, Jim?

650
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:43,324
I know who the Balloonman is.

651
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,226
<i>Maroni: You see, Falcone is only the boss</i>

652
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:53,529
of Gotham because people
believe he's the boss.

653
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,798
That's what this Arkham
thing is gonna change.

654
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:59,068
People are gonna see that
the emperor's got no clothes.

655
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:01,237
I'm wasting my breath. You're an idiot.

656
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,705
Get out of here.

657
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,610
- Who the hell are you?
- Uh, I-I'm sorry, sir.

658
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:08,911
I'm... Hold on.

659
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,913
(Clears his throat) Put that down.

660
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:13,567
You were listening, huh? You're new.

661
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,995
- What's your name?
- Paolo, sir.

662
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,098
Italian. You don't look Italian.

663
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,766
Well, on my mother's side.

664
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,002
It's the side that I claim.

665
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,837
A boy who loves his mother.

666
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,372
(Both laugh)

667
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,480
Here you go.

668
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,348
Take it.

669
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:32,716
I was a lot like you.

670
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:34,718
Started from nothing.

671
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:37,821
But I kept my head down, I
worked hard, now look at me.

672
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:40,691
Gotham is the city of opportunity.

673
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:43,027
Yes, sir. I believe that, too.

674
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,929
You hear what I was saying back there?

675
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:48,232
Those names: Falcone, Arkham--

676
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,167
they mean anything to you?

677
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,370
Honestly, sir... I didn't
hear anything at all.

678
00:31:53,406 --> 00:31:55,005
That a boy. (Laughs)

679
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,907
Reporter: The Balloonman has struck

680
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,976
once again. Cardinal Quinn, accused

681
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:00,744
of multiple counts of sexual abuse,

682
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,681
is the latest victim of the vigilante.

683
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:06,850
See this... This is not good.

684
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:08,886
You can't go around killing priests.

685
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,889
At least not in public.

686
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:13,357
(Laughing)

687
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,093
Got take care of your mother, Paolo.

688
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:21,198
<i>Gordon: His name is Davis Lamond; 48.</i>

689
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,734
He's worked at juvenile
services for 15 years.

690
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:24,802
No priors.

691
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,470
He didn't show up for work today,

692
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,305
and hasn't been back to his apartment.

693
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:29,640
We have uniforms at both.

694
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,642
And you're positive he's the killer?

695
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,311
We found a form on Cranston's
body that I'd given Lamond

696
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:35,946
yesterday morning.

697
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:38,248
Also keys that opened Lamond's apartment.

698
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:39,717
I'm guessing they had a scuffle,

699
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,251
Cranston went through his pockets,

700
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:43,120
but Lamond managed to
attach him to the balloon.

701
00:32:43,155 --> 00:32:45,990
So what caused Lamond to snap?

702
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:47,992
Not sure.

703
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:51,395
Lamond's coworkers describe
him as thoughtful, dedicated,

704
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,997
sweet-- a few said that.

705
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:55,566
Oh, great, one of those
sweet cop-killing vigilantes.

706
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,068
And what about his last target?

707
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:00,237
Same profile as all the rest.

708
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,605
Well known.

709
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:04,241
Seemingly respectable. Actually corrupt.

710
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,542
This is Gotham.

711
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,478
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

712
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:09,780
Meanwhile, I have the mayor, city council,

713
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:11,315
half the city's judges

714
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,917
and clergy hiding indoors
screaming at the commissioner

715
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:16,487
to find the guy. And
guess who he screams at?

716
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:19,156
We've got his photo out there.
It's just a matter of time.

717
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:26,864
- Nothing.
- Really?

718
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,033
Your network of Chinese
loan sharks and hookers

719
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,134
came up empty?

720
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:32,369
Gloat later. Let's think about it.

721
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:33,871
He had to store the balloons,

722
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:36,840
the helium canisters,
the carts he was using...

723
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:38,976
Uh, maybe a storage facility.

724
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:40,344
A warehouse.

725
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:43,313
Or an abandoned building.

726
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:45,449
That's it? How'd you come up with that?

727
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,284
It's the same thing I just said.

728
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,590
What made you figure this place?

729
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,492
The girl yesterday, Selina,

730
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,961
she told me she was in
a new juvie building.

731
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:00,631
Lamond, the counselor, said
the same thing, so I'm thinking

732
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,100
what happened to the old juvie building?

733
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,736
Turns out... city's
getting ready to demo it.

734
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:08,672
Look, even if he was here,
he's probably long gone.

735
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,940
He's only got one balloon left.

736
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,809
He knows we're closing in.

737
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,846
Or that's it right there.

738
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:01,625
Bullock!

739
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,198
Drop the gun! Now!

740
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:10,734
I can't do that,
detective. I'm not done yet.

741
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,935
Once more time: Drop it.

742
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,103
You should be helping me.

743
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:14,238
You're wasting your breath.

744
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:15,672
My partner here thinks you're as bad

745
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,974
as the scum you kill.

746
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,942
Me, I can see how you're
kind of doing us a favor.

747
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,677
So don't shoot me, all right?

748
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:22,613
You believe as I do.

749
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:25,048
I know you're the one who
caught those child snatchers.

750
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,151
- You risked your life.
- Uh, so did I.

751
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:29,153
You want to protect the innocent?

752
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,288
Yes. And we have laws for that.

753
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:33,290
And what good are laws when they require

754
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:36,260
men like your lieutenant
Cranston to implement them?

755
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:38,295
And Ronald Danzer--
you really think

756
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,164
he would've ever seen the inside of a jail?

757
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,431
Or that priest?

758
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,567
Why didn't the law punish him?

759
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,837
You know, I have given my life

760
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:48,705
to the lost children of Gotham

761
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:50,240
because I wanted to make a difference.

762
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:53,310
And you know what kind of
difference I made? None.

763
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:55,045
Because the people running this city

764
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,781
feed off the weak and
the law protects them.

765
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:00,717
And when your mayor rounded
up all those children

766
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,820
to send off to that prison upstate,

767
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:05,455
I decided "no more."

768
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:08,325
I would teach them there are consequences.

769
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,361
So why don't you ask yourself, detective:

770
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,363
Who are you fighting for?

771
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:17,201
A mayor in the mob's
pocket? Cops on the take?

772
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:20,337
Or for the weak and the innocent?

773
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:22,172
Who are you, finally?

774
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:25,843
Aw, forget it.

775
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:32,983
(Air hissing)

776
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,820
No, no! Aah! (Yelling)

777
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:37,955
What're you doing?

778
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,690
- How do you like that?
- Grab him!

779
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:42,059
How's it feel? You're
hoisted by your own petard.

780
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:44,828
(Grunts)

781
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:46,396
No, Jim.

782
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:48,732
Jim, what are you doing?

783
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,033
Jim, let go.

784
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:51,835
Gordon: Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!

785
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:52,903
Jim!

786
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:53,937
Bullock: Let go!

787
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:55,973
Gordon: Shoot it!

788
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,574
Just let go!

789
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,209
Shoot it, now!

790
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,755
(Groans)

791
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,094
Carmine.

792
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:30,329
What a lovely surprise.

793
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:33,266
We're not quite open, but for you...

794
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,801
Hello, Fish.

795
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,235
Just stopped by on my way to dinner.

796
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,104
I wanted to make sure
there were no hard feelings.

797
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,607
Mm. Never.

798
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:43,739
That's my girl.

799
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,275
Speaking of your girl,
that better be the reason

800
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,477
why you're ditching me tonight.

801
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,179
What's her name again?

802
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,082
- Nadia?
- Natalia.

803
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,084
And no. She had an accident.

804
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,819
I hope nothing serious.

805
00:37:56,854 --> 00:38:00,489
- A mugging.
- Mugging?!

806
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,991
Ever since the Waynes were killed,

807
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,292
the city has gone crazy.

808
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:08,631
I hope the punk who did
it paid with his life.

809
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,000
He will. When we find him.

810
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,335
Along with anyone who helped him.

811
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:20,809
Are you hearing any
rumblings from Maroni's camp?

812
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:22,745
You don't actually believe that Maroni

813
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,713
had something to do with it, do you?

814
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:26,215
Like you say:

815
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,752
People are acting crazy,
and crazy's bad for business.

816
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,954
Especially with everything on the horizon.

817
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,291
You're talking about Arkham.

818
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,693
I thought you had that locked up.

819
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:40,229
Mm.

820
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:41,697
Keep your eyes open.

821
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,033
(Kisses)

822
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:53,842
Hold on. Hold on.

823
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:56,745
Give me a second.

824
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:58,581
There will be more

825
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:01,417
like me, detective.

826
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,085
You know that, don't you?

827
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,521
Not if we do our job.

828
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:08,057
And we will. I will.

829
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:10,059
You had your chance.

830
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,194
All of you.

831
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,163
Who was your last target?

832
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,566
(Weak grunt)

833
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,802
The crusade of the vigilante
known as the Balloonman

834
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:22,504
ended tonight when he
was apprehended by police.

835
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,406
He was one man who stood
up to the corruption

836
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:26,508
eating at the heart of Gotham,
willing to break the law

837
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,244
in order to save it.

838
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,579
Well, I imagine the criminals of Gotham

839
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,181
are sleeping well tonight.

840
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:34,216
He killed people.

841
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:37,286
That made him a criminal, too.

842
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:39,488
That's very true.

843
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:41,957
Can I get you anything else?

844
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,626
No, thank you, Alfred.

845
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,961
Right, well, you know...

846
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,430
Do try and eat a bit, won't you?

847
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,432
Be a shame to have you floating away.

848
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:52,434
TV reporter: ...The GCPD claims a win,

849
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,770
but this journalist is left to wonder:

850
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,405
Now that the Balloonman is gone,

851
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,907
who will defend the people of Gotham?

852
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:01,210
This is channel 7 at 7:00, reporting live

853
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,711
from the former Gotham

854
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,447
juvenile facility center in downtown,

855
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,583
with your minute-to-minute updates.

856
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,618
Back to the newsroom, John.

857
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:21,163
(Groans quietly)

858
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:30,439
You're okay.

859
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,276
Are you okay?

860
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:37,846
Yeah. I fell is all. I'm fine.

861
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:47,256
What's wrong?

862
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,994
I want you to know

863
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:54,263
that you can tell me anything.

864
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:58,267
The city's sick.

865
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,137
Sick in a way I hadn't realized.

866
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,710
When they were taking him away,

867
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,978
this Balloonman killer,

868
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:12,348
I asked who his last target was.

869
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:15,184
You know what he said?

870
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:17,286
Doesn't matter.

871
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:24,026
He meant the mayor, judges,
anyone in a position of power--

872
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:25,527
they're all guilty.

873
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:28,364
But that's not true.

874
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:31,433
It's how he feels. It's how they all feel.

875
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,701
Everyone.

876
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,804
That's why the city embraced him.

877
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,608
Because we let them down.

878
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:42,511
But if people take the
law into their own hands,

879
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,646
then there is no law.

880
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,649
And we're lost.

881
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:52,755
There are cops who do it.

882
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,393
The same thing he did.

883
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:01,029
But you never would.

884
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:04,366
Do you think I could?

885
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,703
(Sighs)

886
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,037
No.

887
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:14,343
I know you,

888
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,378
Jim Gordon.

889
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:20,015
And I love you.

890
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,957
And now I'm gonna get you a drink.

891
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:37,199
- (Knocking on door)
- I'll get it.

892
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,815
Jim.

893
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,939
Hello, James.

894
00:42:52,896 --> 00:42:54,093
Old friend.

895
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:06,584
