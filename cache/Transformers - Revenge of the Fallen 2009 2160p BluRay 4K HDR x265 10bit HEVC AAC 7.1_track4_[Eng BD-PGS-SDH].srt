like you thought they would?

303
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,993
<i>Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.</i>

304
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,038
<i>The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.</i>

305
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,707
Well , I guess I didn't get that memo.

306
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,795
GALLOWAY: Forgive the interruption ,
General . Excuse me. Coming through .

307
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,256
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

308
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,551
After all the damage in Shanghai ,

309
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,597
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

310
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,895
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

311
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,526
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

312
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,530
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

313
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:47,200
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good .

314
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,161
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

315
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,288
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

316
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,915
in the field for two years.

317
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,293
We've shed blood ,
sweat and precious metal together.

318
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,088
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

319
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,798
Don't tempt me.

320
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,384
GALLOWAY: And the newest members
of your team .

321
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,426
OPTIMUS: Easy.

322
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,761
GALLOWAY: I understand
they arrived here

323
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,721
after you sent a message into space,

324
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,559
an open invitation to come to Earth ,
vetted by no one at the White House.

325
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:16,396
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

326
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,400
<i>And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team</i>

327
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,403
has always been above reproach .

328
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,322
<i>Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

329
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:31,953
<i>that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</i>

330
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,164
Now, what do we know so far?

331
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:41,671
We know that the enemy leader,
classified N BE One, aka Megatron ,

332
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,341
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

333
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,929
<i>surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.</i>

334
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:54,434
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

335
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,436
<i>is locked in an electromagnetic vault</i>

336
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,856
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

337
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,444
SOU N DWAVE: Decepticons,
we have located the shard .

338
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,366
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

339
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,286
well , there's only one clear conclusion !

340
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,205
You ! The Autobots !

341
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,334
They're here to hunt you !

342
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,378
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

343
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,340
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

344
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,634
It sounds to me
like something's coming .

345
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:32,472
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

346
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,267
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

347
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,272
will you leave peacefully?

348
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:46,235
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

349
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:52,575
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

350
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:57,538
What if we leave and you're wrong?

351
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,090
That's a good question .

352
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,258

So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

-That side.
-I already chose that side.

363

You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

Yeah , see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

wrecked and China says "gas leak."

Don't believe the hype, bro.

in LA two years ago

that everyone covered up.

394

Yeah , I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

and they came down and toasted
this woman , and she was like...

on any computer, okay?

And I wasn't there,

-so I can't comment or speculate.
-No.

01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,139
They gotta mean something ,
like a message or like a map.

1057
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,641
Like a map to an Energon source !

1058
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,977
-Can you read this?
-Read?

1059
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,355
No. We don't really do much reading .
Not so much .

1060
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,482
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can .

1061
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,192
Look who came sashaying back!

1062
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,860
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him .

1063
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,779
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

1064
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:51,988
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

1065
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:53,948
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through .

1066
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,659
I heard you have a problem .

1067
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,745
-I think I know someone who can help.
-Who?

1068
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,996
Robo-Warrior.

1069
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,793
LEO: This guy, Robo-Warrior,

1070
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,253
everything about anything alien ,
he's supposed to know.

1071
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,713
One time we revenge-hacked his site

1072
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:13,218
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

1073
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,607
This is it. Yep.

1074
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:28,858
Deli . Good front!

1075
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,778
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?

1076
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,948
N umber 42, we got your kishka, knish ,

1077
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,159
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

1078
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,577
Cash only. Who's next?

1079
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:42,956
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

1080
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,624
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

1081
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,209
You . . . You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish , you retard !

1082
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,627
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form .

1083
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:48,920
Give me your money. Get out of here !

1084
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,924
Hey, Sal ! Watch your reach , huh?
Take a number, young man .

1085
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:54,926
Robo-Warrior.

1086
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,805
-Know him?
-I never heard of him .

1087
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,224
You never heard of
TheReal Effing Deal .com?

1088
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,852
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

1089
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,063
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

1090
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,025
It's him ! It's him !
That's the guy right there ! That's him !

1091
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,528
No.

1092
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,406
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed !

1093
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,867
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-WOMAN : When he says to go,

1094
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,535
-you go.
-That means you , lady, right now.

1095
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,746
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

1096
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:26,291
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven ,

1097
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,709
got the kibosh , disbanded .

1098
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,045
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing .

1099
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,090
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend .

1100
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:38,470
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron ! Where's the whitefish?

1101
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,430
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig .

1102
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,098
-SIMMONS: Yakov!
-What?

1103
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:44,225
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around !

1104
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:46,102
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1105
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,396
-It's my dream .
-Help her out.

1106
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,064
You live with your mama?

1107
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,483
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1108
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:53,443
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1109
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,904
-Yeah , I know.
-And N BE One's still kicking , huh?

1110
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,156
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1111
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,617
I don't know what you're hiding ,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1112
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,453
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish .

1113
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,997
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on , I need your help.

1114
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,666
Really? You need my help?

1115
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,377
I need . . .
Look, I am slowly losing my mind .

1116
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,087
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1117
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:15,298
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1118
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,218
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie !

1119
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,054
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1120
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,306
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1121
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,975
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1122
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:27,977
LEO: Dead pigs.
MI KAELA: Yuck.

1123
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:30,230
What you're about to see is top secret.

1124
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,024
Do not tell my mother.

1125
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,152
LEO: Swine flu . Not good .
SIMMONS: Now you know.

1126
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:39,197
Next time you eat a goat or a pig ,
there's a story behind it.

1127
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,573
Sad little story.

1128
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:41,825
<i>MAN ON TV: An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</i>

1129
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:42,992
<i>Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</i>

1130
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:46,246
SIMMONS: Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1131
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:49,541
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1132
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,252
Okay, Cube-brain .

1133
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,088
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1134
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,506
Where'd you get these?

1135
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,260
Before I got fired ,
I poached S-7's crown jewel ,

1136
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:05,723
over 75 years of alien research ,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1137
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:09,769
The Transformers,
they've been here a long , long time.

1138
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,271
How do I know?

1139
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,274
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1140
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,609
in ancient ruins all over the world .

1141
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,112
China. Egypt. Greece.

1142
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,656
Shot in 1 932.

1143
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,575
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1144
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,244
-Yeah .
-Same ones over here, right?

1145
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,124
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1146
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,128
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed .

1147
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,131
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1148
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,094
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along .

1149
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,472
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1150
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:50,059
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1151
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:53,688
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal ,

1152
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,232
that I was obsessed .

1153
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,067
Me. Can you imagine that?

1154
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:01,279
Yeah . Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1155
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,239
-On Earth . Another source?
-On Earth .

1156
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:06,200
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head , would lead him there.

1157
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:08,036
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1158
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,412
No, no, no, the source is before them .

1159
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,331
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them .

1160
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,498
It's before them .

1161
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:14,584
-So, it comes before them .
-Correct.

1162
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,046
Well , then we're porked ,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon .

1163
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,214
I mean ,
I'm not on speaking terms with them .

1164
01:19:20,298 --> 01:19:22,008
Actually, I am .

1165
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,056
WH EELI E: Let me out!

1166
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,391
-This is going to be a little bit sad .
-Open it.

1167
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,935
(EXCLAIMI NG)

1168
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:34,228
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1169
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,772
Hey, behave !

1170
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,690
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah .

1171
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,567
-And you're training him?
-I'm trying to.

1172
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,154
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1173
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,574
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1174
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,619
Do you want a throwdown ,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1175
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,872
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1176
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,084
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1177
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,585
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1178
01:19:57,669 --> 01:20:01,047
J ust tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1179
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,549
All right.

1180
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,595
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1181
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:11,182
I don't read it, but these guys...

1182
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,768
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1183
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,647
-Is this they?
-Yeah . Seekers, pal . Oldest of the old .

1184
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:21,317
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something . I don't know what.

1185
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:24,904
Nobody tells me nothing , but they'll
translate those symbols for you .

1186
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,323
-And I know where to find them .
-Show us.

1187
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:28,741
Yeah .

1188

SIMMONS: The closest one's
in Washington .

Smithsonian Air and Space Museum .
Land of dreams in there.

1190
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,507
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1191
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,553
-SIMMONS: Hold those.
-What is that?

1192
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:51,597
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1193
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,144
So does Giambi , Jeter.
It's a baseball thing . Okay.

1194
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,687
Watches synchronized ,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1195
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:01,691
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1196
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,526
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1197
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,903
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1198
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,697
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1201
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:12,076
Whoa. Whoa !
No, listen , I can't do this.

1202
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,078

by turning on that machine.</i>

1350
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:54,014
<i>The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</i>

1351
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:57,184
<i>called the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

1352
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,861
<i>A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</i>

1353
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:15,160
<i>The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</i>

1354
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:21,000
<i>so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</i>

1355
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,463
<i>In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</i>

1356
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:29,717
<i>in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</i>

1357
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,345
<i>a tomb we cannot find.</i>

1358
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,477
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1359
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,605
The Fallen knows where it is

1360
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:48,319
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1361
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,321
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1362
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,781
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen .

1363
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,450
Optimus Prime?

1364
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:58,996
So, you've met a Prime?

1365
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,166
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1366
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,377
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1367
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,380
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1368
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,299
So, he's dead .

1369
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,470
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen .

1370
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,557
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1371
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:21,268
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1372
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:22,394
and bring him back to life?

1373
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:27,191
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1374
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:31,153
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1375
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,448
Follow your mind , your map,
your symbols.

1376

What you carved in the sand ,
it's your clue.

1377
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,456
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1378
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,500

Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1383

Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1384
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:07,272
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-It's part of the Red Sea.

1385
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:09,525
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1386
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,445
29. 5 degrees north , 35 east. Here it is.

1387
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:15,906
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1388
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,450
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

a thing worth doing until now.

Not to call you a coward , Master,

1971
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:45,479
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1972

This isn't over.

1973
02:21:15,718 --> 02:21:18,596
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1974
02:21:20,222 --> 02:21:21,766
You said it first.
