00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,830
the middle school
production of "Guys and Dolls"

535

Okay, um, one more.

537
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,590
So, when your dad was
about ten,

538
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:40,678
there was a kid in his class
that lost his folks.

539
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,681
Kid stopped smiling,
barely spoke.

540
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,932
And for some reason,
all of the other kids in school

541
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,601
were being so mean to him.

542
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,481
So, your father had lunch with
this boy

543
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,150
every single day

544
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,277
for a whole year.

545
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,656
And when springtime came
and the yearbook came out

546
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:04,577
your father gave the kid
an entire page

547
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,953
and the photos
of his science fair project

548
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,955
made him "most
likely to succeed."

549
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,419
And then the boy
finally smiled.

550
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:21,760
- Wait, but dad
wasn't in yearbook.

551
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,268
That story
wasn't about dad, was it?
