1
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,651
No, no, no.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,889
Come on, man.
I'm just trying to make an honest living.

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,048
There's nothing honest
about what you do.

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,928
Who supplies you with Vertigo?
Tell me now and you live.

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,128
Please! He'll kill me!

6
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,607
Whoever you fear...

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,610
...fear me more.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,529
Okay, okay!

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,244
They call him The Count.
That's all I know.

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,409
I swear to God!

11
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,889
Hey! You get me down from here!

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,483
- Find what you're looking for?
- Took down three Vertigo pushers.

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,604
The last one finally knew a name.
The Count.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,201
The Count?
That's worse than The Hood.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,564
- You're not going back out there?
- I'm not done for the night.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,842
This Count has a lot of blood
on his hands.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,964
- It is long past time he started paying.
- Slow down.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,771
- I think you're missing the point here.
- What?

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,171
- Thea.
- Her hearing's in a few hours.

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,926
You think she cares more
about some drug lord...

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,124
...or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,883
- Hey, we should get going.
- Heh.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,447
Judges don't appreciate the value
of being fashionably late.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,163
- Got any other tips?
- Ahh, let the lawyer do all the talking.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,762
They give you a pad and paper,
but do not play tic-tac-toe.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,567
Judges don't appreciate that either.

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,285
Come on, Speedy.

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,562
I know. I know.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,566
I keep on trying to get up and go...

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,287
...but, heh, I just don't.

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,651
I wish Dad were here.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,770
I'm here.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,567
We should leave now, Thea.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,928
Miss Queen. Thea, over here.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,600
Can we get a comment?
Just one comment.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,563
Thea, are you going into rehab?

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,921
Are you being expelled from Balliol Prep?

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,646
Are you worried about the outcome?

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,083
"Docket ending 1-10-5-6,
People v. Thea Dearden Queen.

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,722
Possession of a controlled substance.
Driving under the influence."

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,809
Counselors, I understand
you've reached a plea agreement?

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,327
We have.
Given that my client is a juvenile...

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,522
...the people have agreed
to probation.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,684
A juvenile?

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,604
Says right here she's 18.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,569
She is 18 now, but at her arrest...

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,531
...she was still two days shy
of her 18th birthday.

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,764
- Miss Queen has no priors.
- Just because Miss Queen's family...

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,203
...sweeps her priors under the rug,
doesn't mean they don't exist.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,164
You get your client off.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,601
You help your boss
avoid dealing with a drug...

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,087
...that's sweeping across our city
like a plague.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,044
Everyone wins, except us...

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,886
- ...people of Starling City.
- With all due respect...

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,206
Miss Queen...

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,847
...like it or not, you are now
the poster child for this menace.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,168
Maybe if people see
that the Queen family...

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,442
...can't get away with using Vertigo...

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,286
...they'll think twice
before using it themselves.

60
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,926
The plea arrangement is denied.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,962
This case will proceed to trial.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,925
They can't do this.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,726
That man cannot send my daughter
to prison.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,526
What are our options?

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,609
An interlocutory appeal.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,770
The trial judges have discretion
to reject plea agreements.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,208
You might prepare
for the possibility...

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,886
...that this isn't gonna go our way.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,564
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.
I'll get to work on the appeal.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,086
Well, so much for the best
criminal defense attorney in the city.

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,689
Thea, we will handle this. I promise.

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,969
Like you promised Walter
you'd always stay faithful to him?

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,970
- I feel better already.
- That's enough.

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,210
Don't worry. Sounds like you won't have
to be putting up with me much longer.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,922
What, does she not realize
how serious this is? She took drugs.

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,242
She drove.
She could have killed someone.

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,686
- Or herself.
- I know.

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,327
All that judge is looking for
is someone to make an example of.

79
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,964
Why does it have to be her?

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,449
Maybe it doesn't.

81
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,167
Listen, I have to go do something.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,090
Are you gonna be okay?

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,968
I'm not the one facing prison.

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,846
Working for them now?

85
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,489
Why are you doing this to me?

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,006
I thought we were friends...

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,249
...or something.

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,169
Why'd you bother keeping me safe if
you were gonna hand me over to them?

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,281
Just get me out of here, okay?

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,929
I can't.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,122
Hey. Don't leave me here.

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,288
I came back for you.

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,084
Now you hear me.

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,886
I came back for you!

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,290
Looking for a Detective Hall.
I was told he works in Vice.

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,289
Oliver?

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,884
McKenna Hall.

98
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,367
Hi, heh.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,882
Here I was, expecting a middle-aged guy
in a bad suit.

100
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,809
And I got McKenna Hall.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,764
- I live to surprise.
- Oh.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,167
- I remember.
- Heh.

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,806
What was that club you got us
kicked out of? The Club DeVille?

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,163
In my defense there was no sign that
said you had to keep your clothes on.

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,369
So a cop. I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,210
I still go to raves.
I just go undercover now.

107
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,761
And I have to dress
slightly more appropriately...

108
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,406
- ...to hide my badge and gun.
- Right.

109
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,523
So, what do you need with a vice cop?

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,927
- Vertigo.
- Right. I saw your sister on TV.

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,925
- I'm sorry.
- The judge is making an example of her.

112
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,529
So if you could find the person selling
drugs, it might take some heat off Thea.

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,246
Easier said than done.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,842
Did some digging
and came up with a name.

115
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,884
Um, The Count?

116
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,449
We've known about The Count
for months.

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,727
Oh.

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,242
I wish this was thicker,
but we really don't have much on him.

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,965
Love to say we're gonna catch him before
your sister's trial but it's unlikely.

120
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,408
Oh, I'm late for my shift.

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,606
Well, if you hear of anything
about this guy, just let me know?

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Always loved how much you
cared about your sister...

123
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,606
...but leave the policing to the police.

124
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,490
Okay.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,081
What did Queen want?

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,284
He's an old friend.
His sister's jammed up.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,810
- Anything else, sergeant?
- No.

128
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,928
- You need a tailor.
- You know about the Hood.

129
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,366
He just cornered me, man.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,451
The Hood guy?

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,005
I didn't say anything.

132
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,169
Oh, I know.

133
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,609
You can't divulge secrets
you don't know.

134
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,968
But examples must be made.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,166
Vertigo...

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,011
...in its purest form.

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,043
When injected into the bloodstream...

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,481
...affects the thalamus region
of your brain...

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,969
...which is where all of the information
from your pain receptors is collected.

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,931
No doubt you're in excruciating pain...

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,810
...but actually you're not.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,207
You just think you are.

143
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,084
I've seen it last for days...

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,965
...until finally the heart gives out.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,082
One bullet left.

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,362
Now, you can use that bullet to shoot me
and take your revenge...

147
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,285
...or you could shoot yourself.

148
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,521
It's your choice.

149
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,088
The Hood...

150
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,921
...coming for me.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,207
Interesting.

152
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,642
I'm learning
you're not a morning snuggler.

153
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,208
I'm learning you don't like to wake up
at any hour that ends in a.m.

154
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,447
That's true. Yeah.

155
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,043
So if you're busy being a lawyer all day
and I'm managing a nightclub all night...

156
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,004
...when exactly do we get
to see each other?

157
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,091
Hmm, I got it. Stay.

158
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,168
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,369
Hey, how is Thea holding up?

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,688
She's doing okay. Thank you.

161
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,086
Um...

162
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,086
Actually, uh, I came to talk to Laurel.

163
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,731
Yeah.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,843
- Hi.
- Hi.

165
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,288
Thank you for coming to court
yesterday.

166
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,166
Of course. But I don't think the judge
is willing to move off his position.

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,407
Taking a hard line against criminals
is a platform for his reelection.

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,568
I need you to talk to your father.

169
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,006
He's inside the system...

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,363
...and maybe he cashes in a chip
with Judge Brackett...

171
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,404
- ...gets him off throwing book at Thea.
- Oliver, I don't...

172
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,248
Laurel, I am working on something
on my end...

173
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,050
...but if it doesn't work out,
this is my best chance to help my sister.

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,487
Please.

175
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,448
I'll see what I can do.

176
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,281
- But no promises.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,485
Yep.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,731
- Absolutely not.
- Dad, I know how you feel about Oliver.

179
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,410
Then why would you even ask me?

180
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,602
Because Thea,
she's only 18 years old.

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,041
Which makes her an adult.
She can take medicine.

182
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,561
It's about time somebody
in the Queen family did.

183
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,250
What about the Lance family?

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,962
A young girl acting out,
engaging in reckless behavior.

185
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,049
Does that sound familiar?

186
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,083
Laurel, don't go there.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,687
Thea, she's just like I remember Sara.

188
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,962
That is not how I remember
your sister.

189
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,851
Because you remember her
the way you wish she had been...

190
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,048
...not the way that she actually was.

191
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,848
She's not the saint
you make her out to be.

192
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,646
I know she was arrested for shoplifting
and I know you made it go away.

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,167
Well, maybe if I'd let her go to jail...

194
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,408
...Queen wouldn't have had her
on that boat.

195
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,729
Dad, you make it sound
like he kidnapped her.

196
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,484
For so long, you and I have blamed
Oliver for Sara's death.

197
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
But Sara's to blame too.

198
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,726
When I look at Thea,
I see Sara's potential in her.

199
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,843
And her flaws too.

200
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,010
Yes, Thea made a mistake...

201
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,641
...but she's been through a lot.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,004
She lost a father and a brother.

203
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,481
She doesn't need prison.

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,842
She needs help.

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,680
So please...

206
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,848
I'll make some calls.

207
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,327
Seen a fair amount of Cyrillic
back in Afghanistan left over by Soviets.

208
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,967
Is this Russian-owned?

209
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,846
It's the not-so-hidden headquarters
of Starling City chapter of the Bratva.

210
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,645
Diggle.

211
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,969
Whatever I say.

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,288
Whatever goes down.

213
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,769
Just go with it.

214
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,084
Good to see you too.

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,324
Long time.

216
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,409
Particularly for Bratva captain.

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,171
I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

218
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,647
I decided on pharmaceuticals.

219
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,927
I don't mean aspirin.

220
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,691
A wise choice.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,641
Mephedrone would be
good investment for you.

222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,047
It's the newest thing.

223
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,242
I was thinking Vertigo.

224
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,686
Newer thing.

225
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,247
Tough market, Vertigo.

226
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,891
- Only one seller.
- I know.

227
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,280
Hoping you could do me a favor,
arrange a meeting.

228
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,250
He is difficult man...

229
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,886
...and he does not like new friends.

230
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,767
This is everything the police
have on him.

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,923
Tell him it's a gift.

232
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,488
I will see what I can do...

233
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,530
...provided you do favor for me.

234
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,287
It is unusual for an American
to hold such a position...

235
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,448
...of esteem in our organization,
Mr. Queen.

236
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,485
Anatoli Knyazev...

237
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,206
- ...he speaks very highly of you.
- He should.

238
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,441
I saved his life.

239
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,451
- What did he do?
- Something I told him not to.

240
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,402
Now, the favor.

241
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,125
Kill this man for me...

242
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,324
...and I will believe your interest
in our organization is genuine.

243
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,890
And then I will arrange
a meeting with The Count.

244
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,601
- Oliver...
- Hey, shut up.

245
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,686
Spasiba.

246
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,002
What are friends for?

247
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,410
I'm out of the gate now.
What's going on?

248
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,688
Are we getting out of here?

249
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,209
Where are you taking me?

250
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,603
Well, I admit that bout
was particularly one-sided.

251
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,208
Would anybody else like
to give it a try?

252
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,649
The point of these little
gladiatorial distractions...

253
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,090
...is to strengthen unit cohesion.

254
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,765
To that end,
I think our newest recruit...

255
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,204
...ought to be afforded
the opportunity to try his hand.

256
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,560
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

257
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,166
- Get it on.
- Get it over with.

258
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,841
I can't believe you just killed that guy.

259
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,930
You really have a low opinion of me.

260
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,160
Whoa, that's a neat trick.
You going to teach me that one day?

261
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,731
- No.
- What are you doing?

262
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,800
You need to arrange a new identity
for this guy. Get him out of the city.

263
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,641
So your Russki pal draws out The Count,
the vigilante takes him down.

264
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,890
No, then the Bratva would know I used
them. That relationship is too valuable.

265
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,168
I do the meet with The Count
as myself...

266
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,364
...let him leave,
then we follow him to his hideout.

267
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,643
- Just that easy, huh?
- I will still need my trusty bodyguard.

268
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,167
Fantastic. Looking forward to my new
and exciting career as a drug dealer.

269
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,121
He is a captain.

270
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,080
And he has money.

271
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,764
- Are you interested?
- Hmm.

272
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,011
Let's say, yes.

273
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,842
My father was able to get Brackett
to back off his hard line stance.

274
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,249
Your father hates me.

275
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,885
- No.
- No.

276
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,009
My father hates him.

277
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,961
- Nobody asked you to get involved.
- I did.

278
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,808
The judge has agreed to a sentence...

279
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,002
...of 500 hours of community service...

280
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,282
...and two years of probation.

281
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,009
Provisional on the appointment
of someone to act in loco parentis.

282
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,281
In loco what?

283
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,921
It means the court
will appoint an individual...

284
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,329
...to assume responsibility for you.

285
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,565
Me.

286
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,888
I say thanks, but no thanks.

287
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,287
Thea,
you don't actually have a choice.

288
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,926
Oh, actually, I do.

289
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,209
See, I'm 18 now
and I can make my own decisions.

290
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,043
So I decide not to be
your ex-girlfriend's office monkey.

291
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,602
Well, if you change your mind, then.

292
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,641
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

293
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,210
Thea.

294
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,561
You're in real trouble. And rightly so.

295
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,525
Doing drugs and driving,
it is beyond stupid.

296
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,167
That is a good deal that Laurel got you.
Why aren't you jumping at it?

297
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,131
- I already have a mother.
- So...

298
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,160
You're gonna go to jail,
and it will ruin the rest of your life.

299
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,570
No, heh, I want to ruin Mom's life.

300
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,401
She's a liar and a cheat.
I mean, deal with it, Ollie.

301
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,003
You can pretend all you want to
that she's a saint, but I hate her.

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,091
- And she betrayed Dad.
- So you're gonna go to jail to spite her?

303
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,766
Thea...

304
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,800
...Mom didn't cheat on Dad.

305
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,761
He cheated on her.

306
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,248
Is that the best you can come up with?

307
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,725
Dad wasn't the man he said he was.

308
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,963
On the Queen's Gambit
right before he died...

309
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,886
...he admitted to me that he failed us.

310
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,648
You, me and Mom.

311
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,326
That he wasn't the man
he said he was...

312
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,046
...and that he just wished...

313
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,285
He wished he had more time
to right his wrongs.

314
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,930
- I don't believe you.
- Yes, you do.

315
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,404
- Speedy...
- Leave me alone.

316
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,809
How dare you.

317
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,641
She was old enough
to know the truth.

318
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,604
Oliver, the Russians called.

319
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,531
The meet is set. It's tonight.

320
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,169
You know why they call him The Count?

321
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,651
When he was developing this drug,
he experimented on the homeless.

322
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,527
Prostitutes, runaways.

323
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,486
The police would find their bodies,
puncture marks on their neck...

324
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,045
...like a vampire.

325
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,888
You should not be in such a hurry
to meet this man.

326
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,526
Thank you for this.

327
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
But I'm not overly concerned
about the S.C.P.D.

328
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,329
Now, I understand you gentlemen wish
to participate in the feel-good business.

329
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,410
- Yes.
- And why is that?

330
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,923
I'm opening a nightclub.
I'd like my customers to have a little...

331
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,200
...something extra.

332
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,609
Well, as it happens,
I'm looking to expand my brand.

333
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,170
A good wine's value is measured
by its vintage.

334
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,966
The number of years
it took to ferment.

335
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,923
Vertigo is measured in lives.

336
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,723
Fifty-six people died
to perfect this high.

337
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,201
Believe me when I say
that they did not die for nothing.

338
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,649
Let's get out of here.
Come on, come on, let's go.

339
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,727
- S.C.P.D. Put your weapons down!
- Move, move.

340
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,211
S.C.P.D. Freeze.

341
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,044
Get down!

342
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,850
Oliver!

343
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,566
No witnesses.

344
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,967
Get out of the car.

345
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,490
- You okay?
- Keep it.

346
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it, got it. Go. Steps, let's go.

347
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,444
Oliver.

348
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,250
Drink.

349
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,642
- You're quick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,127
- All right.
- Come on.

351
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,050
Morning.

352
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,291
How you feeling?

353
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,409
I feel like I'm getting over
the worst hangover of my life. Argh.

354
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,729
That coming from a guy who spent
most of his 20s in a hangover.

355
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,451
Think you can uncuff me?

356
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,964
I'm not gonna kill you.

357
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,560
Promise.

358
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,689
Ah.

359
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,206
- Oh.
- You're standing. That's pretty impressive.

360
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,324
Count got you with half a dose but you
sweated out a small pool coming down.

361
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,565
Ah, The Count.

362
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,204
Any chance our friends
in S.C.P.D. took him down?

363
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,051
None at all.
But we did manage to get this.

364
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,728
I think we should analyze it.

365
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,683
Listen, maybe you need to give it
a few hours.

366
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,089
A near drug overdose isn't something
you just walk away from.

367
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,928
Neither is Thea.

368
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,331
What's wrong?
ls everything okay with Thea?

369
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,171
This isn't about your sister,
this is about you.

370
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,522
Last night, we got a call from a Cl.

371
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,803
Busted up a drug sale between
a bigtime dealer and Russian mob.

372
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,890
"We"? I thought you worked Vice.

373
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,327
Joint task force.

374
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,683
- Vertigo's got everyone holding hands.
- Like I said...

375
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,368
...last night, drug deal gone south.

376
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,844
An eyewitness puts you at the scene.

377
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,481
Whoever he is, he's mistaken.

378
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,570
- Yeah?
- I saw you, Oliver.

379
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,130
Is this true?

380
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,409
I was checking into The Count.

381
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,329
He's the guy who sold drugs to Thea.

382
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,605
Figured I could find out what he looked
like, give your sketch artist something.

383
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,964
I paid a lowlife with a Russian accent an
obscene amount to arrange a meeting.

384
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,208
And did you get eyes on him?

385
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,731
No.

386
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,764
All right. Are you pressing charges
against my son?

387
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,960
Get involved again,
you'll see the inside of a cell.

388
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,686
Unlike last time, you
will not see the way out.

389
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,281
- Detective.
- Thank you very much.

390
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,891
Thank you for what you did for Thea.

391
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,409
My daughter asked me for a favor
and I did it.

392
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,602
And that's the end of it.

393
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,201
- Hope you don't think I sold you out.
- No.

394
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,321
Just doing your job.

395
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,286
- What were you thinking?
- I was trying to help.

396
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,882
By running around with the Russian mob
and a murderous drug dealer?

397
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,562
- Are you out of your mind?
- Heh, Mom, look...

398
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,810
...the real reason that you're upset is
because I told Thea the truth about Dad.

399
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,083
- She never needed to know that.
- Yes, I did.

400
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,809
I'm old enough to know the truth,
Mom.

401
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,281
Mom...

402
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,927
It wasn't about your age.

403
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,840
It was about preserving your memory
of your father.

404
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,051
He loved you.

405
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,684
No matter his faults, he loved you.

406
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,727
I said that I wished...

407
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,609
...you had died instead of him,
but you still didn't say anything.

408
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,926
Why?

409
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,968
One day...

410
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,243
...I hope you're lucky enough
to have a daughter...

411
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,882
...and you'll know why.

412
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,642
I'm so sorry for what I said.

413
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,366
I know, I know.

414
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,408
- Now what?
- Like you said, we analyze the Vertigo.

415
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,329
It's liquid form, it contains water.

416
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,320
So maybe we can trace back
to where in the city The Count is...

417
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,364
...cooking up this garbage.

418
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,807
Oliver? Oliver.

419
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,609
- Hey, we need to get you to a hospital.
- No.

420
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,607
Oliver, God knows what's in that drug.
It could be causing permanent damage.

421
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,845
Ahem, Felicity.
Hey, they said you'd be up here.

422
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,202
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

423
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,448
Not that there are cats
in this building.

424
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,923
Well, once a cat did get in,
but a guard Tased it.

425
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,329
It smelled like fur and static in here
for, like, a week.

426
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,561
Ahem, you mind stepping away
from the window?

427
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,762
I have a little bit of a hangover.

428
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,486
Sounds like you need a Bloody Mary
and a pretzel...

429
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,045
...not the IT Department.

430
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,284
Actually, my buddy Kevin
is starting an energy drink company.

431
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,165
He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers...

432
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,285
...but I am very particular
about what it is I put in my body.

433
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,244
I've noticed.

434
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,727
I said, "not noticed," right?

435
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,520
Trying to find a secret recipe.

436
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,001
Could you do a spectro-analysis
of the sample...

437
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,010
...and find out exactly
where in the city it's made?

438
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,441
If it's an energy drink,
why is it in a syringe?

439
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,166
I ran out of sports bottles.

440
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,805
Your BS stories are getting worse.

441
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,248
Well aware.

442
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,684
Looks like Felicity came through.

443
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,045
The solvent used in the Vertigo sample
was runoff water...

444
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,451
...originated within a 10-block radius
of where East Glades meets the bay.

445
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,089
Nothing there except an old detention
center abandoned about three years ago.

446
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,327
Cutbacks.

447
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,366
You can't go out there, Oliver. Still
suffering the aftereffects of Vertigo.

448
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,683
Did you hear The Count?
He's taking this drug citywide.

449
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,928
We don't stop him,
this becomes an epidemic.

450
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,724
I can stop you from leaving.

451
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,926
Try.

452
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,609
Oliver, hit this and you can leave.

453
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,087
I'm glad you came to your senses.

454
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,924
You should remember one thing, Dig.

455
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,329
- What's that?
- I don't need the bow.

456
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,162
- My Cl swears this is the place.
- Bring your men up on the flank.

457
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,806
- Okay, this way.
- Follow me.

458
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,363
- He's here!
- He who?

459
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,766
The Hood!

460
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,728
Looks like we're not the only guests.

461
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,962
You should have stuck
to your depraved elite.

462
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,250
I'm merely providing people
with what they want.

463
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,126
- I'm providing a public service.
- So am I.

464
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,087
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

465
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,729
Freeze!

466
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,288
Put down the needle
or I will shoot you.

467
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,408
- Put down the syringe.
- He deserves this.

468
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,251
Not according to the law.
People think you're a hero...

469
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
...people like my daughter
if they could see you now.

470
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,241
You're no hero.

471
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,245
You're what I always said you were.

472
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,889
A killer.

473
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,884
Get him.

474
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,928
Get me an ambulance. Now.

475
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,768
Juvenile delinquent
reporting for duty.

476
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,406
Heh, since you lost your license,
I'll pick you up at 5.

477
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,080
Six.
We have a lot of work for her to do.

478
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,766
Well, then, let's say 7, just to be safe.

479
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,450
Is it too late to choose jail?

480
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,847
Yes, ha-ha-ha.

481
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,084
I need you to go through these files,
and pull out the documents...

482
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,486
...dated March 2007.

483
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,330
Do you think you could do that?

484
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,488
I think I can, heh.

485
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,407
Look, I know I messed up.

486
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,121
I really appreciate this, Laurel.

487
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,961
We're gonna make an upstanding citizen
out of you yet, Speedy.

488
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,284
Thank you. This will be good for her
having a role model...

489
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,490
- ...somebody better than me.
- Oh, you're not so bad.

490
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,967
And besides, it will be nice
to have her around.

491
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,570
I gotta take this. Excuse me.

492
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,728
- Hello.
- I got the Count.

493
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,005
Bust up his lab, got him on everything
from drug trafficking to homicide.

494
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,807
- He'll be gone for a long while.
- That's great. Thanks.

495
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,520
It was great seeing you, Oliver, heh.

496
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,529
You too.

497
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,009
See you.

498
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,329
He's still critical.

499
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,325
I've never seen anyone OD
on this much Vertigo and live.

500
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,404
There's just no way of knowing
what damage has been done...

501
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,683
...to his brain and nervous system,
or if it's irreparable.

502
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,243
"Survive."

503
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,046
Thanks for meeting me.
I was nervous to come to your house, heh.

505
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,641
Okay, heh.

506
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,727
The thing is, I've been debating whether
or not to share this with you for weeks.

507
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,402
Can I trust you?

508
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,370
I'm not an idiot. You've dropped
some fairly ridiculous lies on me...

509
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,208
...and yet I still feel
like I can trust you, heh.

510
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,121
Why is that?

511
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,646
I have one of those faces.

512
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,210
Sorry.

513
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,290
Yes.

514
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,284
You can trust me.

515
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,204
Then I have something to show you.

516
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,649
Have you ever seen this before?

517
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,444
No.

518
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,563
Where'd you get it?

519
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,322
From your stepfather.

520
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,806
It's from Walter.

521
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,724
Uh...

522
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,643
Where did he get it?

523
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,403
He said he found it in your house...

524
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,001
...that it belongs to your mother.

525
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,964
Walter thought
she was hiding something.

526
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,124
Something more...

527
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,607
...and he wanted me to look into it,
but then he vanished.

528
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,691
I think this list
might have cost Walter his life.
