00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,196
We could do the same.

164
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,531
No, we couldn't.

165
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,950
This is their country.

166
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,828
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

167
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,707

00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,510
This look like home to you?

172
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,181
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,269
No, you don't.

00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,396
We're at war.

176
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
We've always been at war.

177
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,068
lt's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

178
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,613
We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.

The Watch has given you a great gift.

180
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,535
You only have one thing to give in return,

your life.

182
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,624
-l'll gladly give my life.
-l don't want you to be glad about it.

183
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,544
l want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,255
And know this, boy.

185
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,759
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

186
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,178
They'll never know what you've done.

187
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,182
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

188
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,060
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

189
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,646
north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

190

Now, do you understand me?

191
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,777
l do.

192

You're even dumber than you look.

This letter detailing our infantry movements

00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,652
l traveled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

233
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,737
Ah, the late King Renly.

234
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,365
Rather a short reign.

You say that as if you were

Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

246
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,614
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

247
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,782
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

-feeding horses and soldiers.
-Yes, yes, yes.

The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,213
And Margaery...

Wants to be queen.

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
Yes, she does.

254
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,514
House Tyrell rebelled against the lron Throne.

-Against my grandson.

Why?

491

something to eat, to drink?

492
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,749
l'll have them flogged in the square.

493
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,210
Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,

494
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,796
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what l want.

495
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,382
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

496
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,719
So, my little princess, what is it you want?

497
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,263
My birthright.

498
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,139
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

499
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,101
l fear l'm no better
than a servant in this regard.

500
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,186
l cannot give you what l do not have.

501
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,939
l'm not asking you for the kingdoms.

502
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,524
l'm asking you for ships.

503
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,109
l need to cross the Narrow Sea.

504
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,944
l need my ships as well.

505
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,614
l use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

506
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,616
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid

507
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,160
three times over
when l retake the lron Throne.

508
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,287
Retake?

509
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,081
Did you once sit on the lron Throne?

510
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,834
My father sat there, before he was murdered.

511
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,253
But if you did not sit on it yourself,

512
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,673
would it not be correct
to say "take the lron Throne"?

513
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,925
l didn't come here to argue grammar.

514
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,511
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

515
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,765
So let me explain my position, little princess.

516
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,020
Unlike you, l do not have exalted ancestors.

517
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,771
l make my living by trade.

518
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,733
And l judge every trade on its merits.

519
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,901
You ask for ships.

520
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,738
You say l shall be repaid triple.

521
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,782
l do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

522
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,118
But before you repay your debts,

523
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,537
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

524
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,956
-Do you have an army?
-Not yet.

525
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,583
You do not have an army.

526
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,336
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

527
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,296
There are many there that support my claim.

528
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,422
When were you there last?

529
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,342
l left when l was a baby.

530
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,178
So, in truth, you have no allies.

531
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,682
The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when l return.

532
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,892
Ah.

533
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,311
Forgive me, little princess,

534
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,898
but l cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

535
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,399
Now if you'll pardon me.

536
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,069
Do you know lllyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

537
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,905
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

538
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,241
For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

539
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:19,163
He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

540
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,667
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

541
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,503
But l dreamt that if l carried those eggs

542
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,922
into a great fire, they would hatch.

543
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,343
When l stepped into the fire,
my own people thought l was mad.

544
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,137
But when the fire burned out,

545
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,056
l was unhurt,

546
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,392
the Mother of Dragons.

547
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,188
Do you understand?

548
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,485
l'm no ordinary woman.

549
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,488
My dreams come true.

550
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,620
l admire your passion.

551
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,458
But in business, l trust in logic, not passion.

552
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,044
l'm sorry, little princess.

553
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,838
l am not your little princess.

554
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,341
l am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,

555
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,218
and l will take what is mine.

556
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,679
With fire and blood, l will take it.

557
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,433
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

558

559
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,664
My father, my lord.

560
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,749
Hmm.

561
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
l taught my son Jaime to read.

562
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,508
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

563
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,303
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

564
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,805
He reversed them in his head.

565
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,976
The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction

566
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,228
and that we simply must accept it.

567
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,313
Ha!

568
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:14,320
After that, l sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

569
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,365
He hated me for it, for a time.

570
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,452
For a long time.

571
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,038
But he learned.

572
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,457
Hmm.

573
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,629
Where is your father? ls he alive?

574
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,425
Who was he?

575
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,178
A stonemason.

576
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,514
A stonemason who could read?

577
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Hmm.

578
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,849
He taught himself.

579
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,519
Quite a man.

580
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,396

Loyalty.

Did...

584
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,872
Forgive me, my lord.
l shouldn't ask questions.

585
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,583
No.

588
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,426
l did.

589
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,055
l grew up with him.

590
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,434
l watched him grow old.

591
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,356
He loved us.

592
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
He was a good man,

593
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,736

Let me go and talk to Theon.

There will be no talk. He will die for this.

Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

Let me send word to

Winterfell before the new moon.

We have the Lannisters on the run.

you'll lose what you gained.
