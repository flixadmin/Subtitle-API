1
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,780
Take it!

2
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,690
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,390
Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.

4
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,940
I know that you're probably
gonna be away this weekend.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,440
But listen, just think about
what we're gonna play. Please.

6
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,640
'Cause we have to decide, and we really...
We need to practice, okay?

7
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,970
Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.

8
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,780
And, oh, please call Mom. Please.

9
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,510
'Cause she worries, which you know already.

10
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,810
Okay. Later, A. Bye.

11
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,470
Whoa!

12
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,130
Hey! It's Friday night.

13
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,730
April 25, 2003.

14
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,430
I'm just entering Canyon-lands.

15
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,170
Just me,
the music and the night.

16
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,300
Love it!

17
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,250
Whoo!

18
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,750
Blue John Canyon.

19
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,990
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

20
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,000
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

21
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,220
Whoo!

22
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,350
Your face.

23
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,390
- You looked like a dog.
- I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

24
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't know.
I think we go that way.

25
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,560
But we went that
way and had to come back.

26
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,370
- Hey!
- Whoa.

27
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,900
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

28
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,140
Uh, no, actually. We're headed for the dome.

29
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,680
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

30
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,240
Hang on.

31
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,210
- Oh, my God.
- God.

32
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,890
Let's see this.

33
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,830
You are... here.

34
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,630
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,360
Oh, yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

36
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,770
And the dome is there.

37
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,140
Oh.

38
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,700
Um, I can take you that way if you like.

39
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,370
Uh...

40
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,310
I'm sorry. The, uh- Friday the 13th there.

41
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,710
Child-killer look.

42
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

43
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,110
And today's Saturday, so...

44
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,980
Can't take this off. It's my face.

45
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,620
Nice.

46
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,330
- Aron.
- Kristi.

47
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,870
Allow me to introduce
you to my friend Megan.

48
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,770
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

49
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,400
What do you say?

50
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,500
You're lost. I'm a guide.

51
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm good.

52
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,440
- Why not?
- Sure.

53
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,040
All right. This way.

54
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,710
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

55
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,590
What is that- like, 20 miles?

56
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,790
Seventeen on the odometer.

57
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh. Oh. I thought it was 17.2.

58
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,720
Uh, 17.3 actually.

59
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,930
Ah, you're one of those.

60
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,330
I'm not one of those.

61
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,630
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

62
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,800
It's my second home.

63
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,280
Ah, see?

64
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,210
There's the fork right there.

65
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,410
Aah. Okay, totally missed that.

66
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,640
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

67
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,810
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

68
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,380
Exactly. You go to the
one place in America...

69
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,120
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

70
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,820
And what happens?

71
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,060
All right.

72
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,160
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

73
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,470
But I know a better way- the cool way.

74
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,270
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

75
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,280
Although it's better with your clothes off.

76
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,040
It is a bit of a climb.

77
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,020
We climb.

78
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,060
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

79
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,220
So you get us all
the way back in here...

80
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,130
and then you tell us that
you are not a guide.

81
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

82
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh, that's wonderful.

83
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,070
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...

84
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,910
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

85
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,100
Jesus, what if these things move?

86
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,740
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

87
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,310
- Oh, sure they will.
- What?

88
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,080
- Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.
- Oh!

89
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,810
Let's just hope not today.

90
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,650
Oh. Great.

91
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,890
All right.

92
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,830
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

93
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,530
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

94
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,430
- What...
- Where- Aron!

95
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,200
Are you okay? Aron!

96
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,260
Aron!

97
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,030
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

98
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,620
He's batshit.

99
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,670
You're batshit!

100
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,570
Come on! You gotta come down here!

101
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,730
- Trust me!
- Trust you?

102
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,600
I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

103
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, please. You love this.

104
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,380
Whoa!

105
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,420
Whoo!

106
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,590
Hey!

107
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,130
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

108
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,830
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

109
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,060
It's amazing!

110
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,570
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

111
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,470
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

112
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,770
Fuck.

113
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,570
Oh, shit!

114
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,970
Are you okay?

115
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,540
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

116
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,980
I can't believe I just did that.

117
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,980
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

118
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,620
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

119
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,680
Camera!

120
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,990
Whoo!

121
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,780
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John...

122
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,710
who was Butch Cassidy's cook...

123
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,880
- Ah. That's cool.
- from, you know, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

124
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,610
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

125
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,990
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

126
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,650
But also what they'd do is they'd run horses...
wild horses- into here...

127
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,250
- and they'd trap 'em at the end of the canyons.
- Wow.

128
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,630
- That's how they'd catch the horses.
- Oh, wow.

129
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,430
You wanna take one more picture before I go?

130
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,990
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

131
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,400
Ready?

132
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,070
One, two, three.

133
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,270
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

134
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,330
Well, will I ever see you again?

135
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,680
That depends. Do you party?

136
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,980
Do I party? Uh, yeah, sometimes.

137
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,350
Tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously,
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

138
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,580
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

139
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,250
Okay. Where am I going?

140
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,050
It's about 20 miles away, near Green River.

141
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,390
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

142
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,930
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

143
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,520
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

144
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,460
- Yep. ...
Cool. - Okay.

145
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,030
It was good to meet you. See ya!

146
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,270
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

147
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,310
Yeah!

148
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,870
Rock on!

149
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,510
You think he's actually gonna show up?

150
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,950
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

151
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,180
Oh.

152
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,260
You liked him.

153
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,850
Shit!

154
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,940
This is insane!

155
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,930
Fuck.

156
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,970
Move this fucking rock!

157
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,890
Please.

158
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,520
Fuck.

159
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,790
Fucking save it.

160
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,850
Oh, God.

161
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,610
Kristi!

162
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,920
Megan!

163
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,480
Kristi!

164
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,260
It's Aron!

165
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,300
Megan!

166
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,000
Kristi! Megan!

167
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,160
Kristi!

168
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,590
Think.

169
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,580
Just think.

170
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,510
Ow!

171
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,220
Hmm.

172
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah.

173
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,830
Fuck.

174
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,360
Oh. Fuck.

175
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,390
Shit.

176
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,260
Oh, God.

177
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,460
Shit!

178
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,410
Fucker.

179
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,280
Come on. Please.

180
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,450
Sweet.

181
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,820
Ah.

182
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,190
Oh.

183
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,870
Nice and dull.

184
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,180
Look at the size of this one, man.

185
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,240
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

186
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,260
Yes.

187
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,710
Okay.

188
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,680
Hey!

189
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,890
Hey, buddy.

190
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,160
Here we go.

191
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,450
Um.

192
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,810
It's 3:05...

193
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,290
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

194
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,890
Uh, this marks 24 hours...

195
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,160
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...

196
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,800
right where it slots up before the big drop.

197
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,000
My name's Aron Ralston.

198
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,340
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

199
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,710
Um.

200
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,350
Whoever finds this can keep the- the recorder.

201
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,720
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents...

202
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,660
and-and give them this tape.

203
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,290
I'd appreciate it.

204
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,100
Uh, I was descending Blue John yesterday...

205
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:20,510
uh, when this, uh, chockstone came loose...

206
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,130
and rolled onto my arm...

207
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,040
and now it's stuck.

208
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:30,920
Um, the thumb is kind
of this gray-blue color.

209
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,280
Yeah.

210
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,950
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

211
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,190
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

212
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm low on food.

213
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,830
Um.

214
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,740
That's about 300, 400 mil...

215
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,910
and that's it for water.

216
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,850
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

217
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,220
Hello!

218
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,450
Please!

219
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,620
There's someone down here!

220
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,860
Help!

221
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,920
I'm in the canyon!

222
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,630
Help!

223
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,370
Help! Help!

224
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,660
Please!

225
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,070
Help!

226
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,070
Help!

227
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,340
Down here!

228
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,810
Help!

229
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,260
Don't lose it.

230
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,830
Aron.

231
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,140
Do not lose it.

232
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,590
Not bad.

233
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,570
Oh, dinner.

234
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,180
Tomorrow night, we're actually,
seriously, throwing a party.

235
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,380
You should come by, have a beer, kick back.

236
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,050
There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

237
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,030
Scooby-Doo.

238
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,910
Hmm. Mountain Dew.

239
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,380
Plastic cup.

240
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,090
Thank you.

241
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,530
Oh.

242
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,930
Might take a beer as well.

243
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,570
Don't mind if I do.

244
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,380
Oh.

245
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,190
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

246
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,060
Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.

247
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,040
Are you there?

248
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,880
Hello?

249
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,310
Okay. Nothing urgent.

250
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,750
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

251
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,380
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

252
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,510
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

253
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,610
Right there, Brion.

254
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,520
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

255
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,950
Have a good one.

256
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,180
Always do.

257
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,050
Always do.

258
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,690
Let's go.

259
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,920
Oh, come on!

260
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,620
Crap.

261
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,190
This is freaking me out, looking at myself.

262
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,160
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

263
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,370
Uh.

264
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,040
It's Monday. Um.

265
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,710
Bummer, all day.

266
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,450
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...

267
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,080
but it didn't work.

268
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,090
It was worth a try.

269
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,920
But there's too much friction.

270
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,230
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

271
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,090
What I could really use...

272
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:19,040
is about 20 meters of
static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

273
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,300
Uh, three or four pulleys...

274
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,810
a rack of carabiners, a sling...

275
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,320
power drill... and bolt kit.

276
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,680
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.

277
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,130
That should just about do it.

278
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,120
I have, uh...

279
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,030
about 150 milliliters of water left...

280
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,340
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

281
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,440
if I'm lucky.

282
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,240
I peed twice.

283
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,720
Almost pissed my pants.

284
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,980
Uh, I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

285
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,230
The second time, I did it in the CamelBak.

286
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,300
Smells really bad.

287
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,500
But, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.

288
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,480
It's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.

289
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,210
No number twos.

290
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,650
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

291
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,150
They'll just have to wait.

292
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,660
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

293
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,520
Um...

294
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,760
There's this raven that comes every morning.

295
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,940
Hey.

296
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,530
I clocked it at 8:17.

297
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,530
I'll- I'll film it for you tomorrow.

298
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:07,340
Every morning at, uh, 9:30...

299
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,910
I get 15 minutes of sunlight.

300
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,510
It's really nice.

301
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,560
I have been chipping away.

302
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,430
More to- More to keep warm than anything.

303
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,970
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

304
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,130
So when I chip away a little bit...

305
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,300
it actually settles more.

306
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,710
So...

307
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,380
I found this great tourniquet.

308
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,910
Oh.

309
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,950
Oh, yeah.

310
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,230
It hasn't been very useful.

311
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,740
Lesson:

312
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,980
Don't buy the cheap,
made-in-China multi-tool.

313
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,540
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...

314
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,520
This thing came free with a flashlight.

315
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:30,580
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

316
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,220
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

317
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,820
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

318
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,600
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

319
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,210
And there's no way
you could have ever known...

320
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,110
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

321
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,770
When we watch this later,
will the camera have to be on?

322
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,510
Yeah. So you have to
leave the camera with us...

323
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,880
if we want to watch something
that you've made, right?

324
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,680
- Yeah.
- Good job, honey.

325
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,190
- Isn't that great?
- That is quite extraordinary.

326
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,160
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

327
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,790
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live...

328
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,700
but he's going to be
able to show this again.

329
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,000
Go away.

330
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,510
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a...

331
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,810
So good.

332
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,510
Well done. Okay.

333
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,550
Way to go, Sis.

334
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,180
- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey. Keep going.

335
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,710
Fuck.

336
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,670
Okay!

337
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,900
Go!

338
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,060
Whoo!

339
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,400
I love you.

340
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,360
So...

341
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,440
how do I get in?

342
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,210
What's the, um...

343
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,550
- You know?
- Combination.

344
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,820
Combination.

345
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,990
If I told you...

346
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,620
I'd have to kill you.

347
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,690
But already you kill me.

348
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,670
Combination?

349
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,760
I think I have it.

350
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,660
Fuck!

351
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,370
Ah, fuck.

352
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:30,220
Ah. Ah.

353
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,980
Fuck. Fuck.

354
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,260
Who's there?

355
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,110
Aron?

356
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,740
Please!

357
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,910
Please!

358
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:58,630
Please!

359
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,900
Good morning, everybody out there. Steve.

360
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,470
- Good morning.
- It's The Morning Show
with Brian Stephenson...

361
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,140
Also coming up this half hour..

362
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:17,050
Good morning. This will
get you going today. 90 for your high...

363
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,010
Good morning, everyone!

364
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:26,390
It is 7:00 here in Canyonland, U.S.A.

365
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,190
And this morning on the boulder...

366
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,890
we have a very special guest...

367
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,560
self-proclaimed American superhero...

368
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,070
Aron Ralston!

369
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,700
Let's hear it for Aron!

370
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,000
Hey.

371
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,070
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's...

372
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:49,600
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,640
Um- Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

374
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,850
Mom and Dad!

375
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,150
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

376
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,280
Yeah. That's right.

377
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,330
Uh- Hey, Mom.

378
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,230
I'm really sorry I...

379
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,990
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

380
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,660
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then...

381
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,730
Well, I probably wouldn't be here right now.

382
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,570
That's for sure!

383
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,300
But like I always say...

384
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,140
your supreme selfishness...

385
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,240
is our gain.

386
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,680
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

387
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,590
Um- Well, Brion at work.

388
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,320
- Hi, Aron!
- Hey.

389
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,360
Uh, I probably won't be
making it into work today.

390
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,090
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

391
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:44,000
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron...

392
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,510
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

393
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,040
Aron asks...

394
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,340
Am I right in thinking...

395
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,540
that even if Brion from work...

396
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,210
notifies the police...

397
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,550
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

398
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,880
before they file a Missing Persons report?

399
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,090
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

400
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,290
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

401
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,630
Ah, yeah.
You're right on the money there, Aron.

402
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,570
Which means I'll probably be dead by then.

403
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,340
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much?

404
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,970
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

405
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,040
I volunteer for the rescue service.

406
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,050
Hmm?

407
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,950
You see, I'm something of a, uh...

408
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,450
well, a big fucking hard hero.

409
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,530
And I can do everything on my own, you see?

410
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,190
I do see.

411
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,420
Now...

412
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,900
is it true that despite...

413
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:54,500
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero...

414
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,870
you didn't tell anyone where you were going?

415
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,040
Uh...

416
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,100
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

417
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,250
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

418
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,520
Oops!

419
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,490
Oops.

420
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,470
Oops.

421
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,910
Mom, Dad.

422
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,390
I just want to take this time to tell you...

423
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:50,120
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

424
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,430
And I haven't appreciated you in my heart...

425
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,490
as I know that I could.

426
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,610
Mom, I love you...

427
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,240
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

428
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,180
I love you guys...

429
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,190
and I'll always be with you.

430
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,460
Yeah.

431
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,780
Oh.

432
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,580
Ah.

433
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,890
Bone.

434
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:15,700
It's no Slurpee.

435
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,970
It's like a bag of piss.

436
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,450
- Yahoo!
- Nice!

437
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,100
Come on, Ralston!

438
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,670
Okay, I'm gonna go up again.

439
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,680
Give me that.

440
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,910
Quick, while he's gone.

441
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,810
- Listen.
- We could tell him.

442
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,610
- I know that.
- Okay? Tell him.

443
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,150
- We're very worried about you.
-

444
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,190
- We're worried...
- About your music.

445
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,120
Your musical choices are really rough.

446
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,160
If you keep singing Phish,
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.

447
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,590
- Never.
- You might have one, but I really doubt that you do.

448
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,500
- You may be sort of cute, occasionally.
- I'm nervous and scared for you.

449
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:22,430
- Okay. This cannonball's for you.
- No one will care.

450
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,230
Okay.

451
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,110
That was a 10.

452
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,670
All right.

453
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:35,440
I'm going to test your theory...

454
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,850
about whether or not it's better to do it...

455
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,220
Oh, God!

456
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,810
without your clothes on.

457
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:44,880
I'm just gonna swim for a bit.

458
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,310
Don't.

459
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,750
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

460
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,480
Oh, please.

461
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,190
Don't.

462
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,890
Don't.

463
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,090
Ralston, rock on.

464
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,650
Whoo!

465
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,970
Oh, fuck.

466
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,570
You don't even
want me here, do you?

467
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,540
I'm gonna go, Aron.

468
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,480
Is that what you want?

469
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,350
It is, isn't it?

470
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,860
Okay.

471
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,330
Come back.

472
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,400
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

473
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:12,000
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50!

474
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,500
You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!

475
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,470
Um, I'm holding on.

476
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,110
Time's moving really slowly.

477
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,150
My heart's beating really fast.

478
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,940
I swear to God, it feels like...

479
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,250
- It feels like- - It's beating, like,
three times as fast as it should be.

480
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,920
So cold.

481
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,650
So cold.

482
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,670
Oh.

483
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,290
Hey.

484
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:52,770
Blue John.

485
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:01,300
I... love... you.

486
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,040
There you are.

487
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,480
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

488
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,450
I've been thinking about you, girl.

489
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,180
I admit it. I admit it.

490
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,920
I know how I am. I tried to do everything.

491
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,190
- Where I was.
- I tried.

492
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,000
Aron? Where are you?

493
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,000
Where are you?

494
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,310
What are you guys doing here?

495
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,420
Eddie? Tom?

496
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,220
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

497
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,890
Eric? Hey.

498
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,860
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

499
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,030
Dorks.

500
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,260
Found you, Aron.

501
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,310
Sis, I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding.

502
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:18,090
I know that I promised to play,
that we'd play.

503
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,750
I'm sorry.

504
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:22,600
I know it'll be a good one.

505
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,900
8:15. There's no raven.

506
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:29,300
8:20.

507
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,200
8:30. My raven didn't come.

508
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,570
I've been thinking.

509
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,570
Everything is...

510
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,710
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

511
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,950
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

512
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,250
Laters!

513
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,150
- It's me.
- Aron, it's Mom.

514
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,590
- I was hoping to catch you.
- I chose this.

515
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,920
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

516
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,220
I chose all of this.

517
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,560
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

518
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,430
This rock.

519
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,560
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

520
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,630
I hate this rock!

521
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,780
- In its entire life...
- ever since it was...

522
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,210
a bit of meteorite...

523
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,950
a million billion years ago...

524
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,680
How the fuck did this get here?

525
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,240
up there in space...

526
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,150
it's been waiting...

527
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,590
to come here...

528
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,860
right- right here.

529
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,360
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

530
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,100
The minute I was born,
every breath I've taken...

531
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,540
every action...

532
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:44,770
has been leading me to this crack...

533
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,010
on the earth's surface.

534
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,510
Oh!

535
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:41,280
Oh.

536
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:55,500
Oh. Oh.

537
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,530
Okay. Come on.

538
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,670
Don't pass out.

539
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,980
Don't fall asleep.

540
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,640
Thank you.

541
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,080
Easy.

542
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:01,350
Easy. Come on.

543
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,550
Oh!

544
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,430
Help!

545
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,970
Please!

546
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,940
Help me!

547
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,810
I need help!

548
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:58,590
My name is Aron Ral- Aron Ralston.

549
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,860
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

550
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,990
I haven't had food or water for five days.

551
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,560
This morning I cut my arm...

552
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,440
This morning I cut my arm off.

553
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,540
Please. Some water?

554
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:16,810
Thank you.

555
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,890
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

556
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,760
You should stop and rest.

557
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,990
No. I've gotta keep going.

558
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,170
Can one of you run?

559
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,570
Can one of you run ahead?
