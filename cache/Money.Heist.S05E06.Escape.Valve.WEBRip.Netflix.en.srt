1
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,666
According to astrophysicists,
nearly all of the gold on earth

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,625
came here four billion years ago
during a meteor shower.

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,333
Maybe the metal's violent arrival
caused it to be cursed forever.

4
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,875
No other metal has caused as many murders…

5
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,083
as the one we use to propose marriage.

6
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,500
No other metal has caused so much pain.

7
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,166
So much madness.

8
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,875
Professor, open the door.

9
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,083
-No!
-Professor, open the door!

10
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,291
Leave me alone.

11
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,166
What the fuck are you doing?

12
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,291
What?

13
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,583
Mónica, what are you doing? What's wrong?

14
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,708
Leave her alone.

15
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,458
Tokyo's dead. What are you laughing about?

16
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,833
I shot up some morphine.

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,333
What?

18
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:55,458
I was just a name on the casualty list
where only the golden metal survives.

19
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,125
Because while everything else decays,
gold remains intact.

20
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,833
Tokyo is dead?

21
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:06,958
Tokyo is dead.

22
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,500
Tokyo is dead.

23
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,666
Tokyo is dead?

24
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,875
I just wanted the pain to go away, Denver.

25
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,250
Honey…

26
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,458
I love you.

27
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,083
Professor, you need
to control your breathing.

28
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,916
Come on, breathe.

29
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,125
Hold your breath

30
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,833
and count with me. One,

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,208
two, three, four.

32
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,833
And exhale.

33
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,083
Again, Professor.

34
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,208
Take a deep breath.

35
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,708
Count.

36
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,125
One, two, three…

37
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,458
Colonel,

38
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,458
we took down Silene Oliveira, AKA Tokyo.

39
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,166
Fuck, finally, some good news.
Turn the speakers on.

40
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,750
Gentlemen, we took down
one of the thieves.

41
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,875
Oliveira resisted.

42
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,125
Salvador Torrecilla, down.

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,000
Lucas Hernando, down.

44
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,500
Isaac Cobo, down.

45
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,791
Mateo Canalejas, down.

46
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,708
And César Gandía, down.

47
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,458
Vázquez, injured. Arteche, minor injuries.

48
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,666
And I am unharmed.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,666
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,291
Your operation is hereby aborted.
Prepare to evacuate by air.

51
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,250
No, Colonel.

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,208
We are not going to withdraw.

53
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
We came in here with the mission

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,458
to end this heist
and that's what we're going to do.

55
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,458
Sagasta, there's two of you
and one psycho.

56
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,125
Right now, you don't stand a chance.

57
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,416
More than ever,

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,541
because this time
they really won't see it coming.

59
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,291
So, Colonel,
do not launch any other operation.

60
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,416
Over and out.

61
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,625
-Are you sure you're okay?
-It's nothing. A loose shard.

62
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,208
Give me your tag.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,416
Is anybody there?

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
One of my men is injured.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
He needs to be evacuated.

66
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,791
-And the rest?
-The rest are down.

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
Just me and the injured are left.

68
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,291
The soldiers want to negotiate.

69
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,541
I repeat, they want to negotiate.
I request permission to do so.

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Feeling better?

71
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,375
God.

72
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,541
Professor, Sierra is running away.
She stole a car.

73
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,541
Benjamín, you're in charge.

74
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,041
Marseille, come with me.

75
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,916
Fuck.

76
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,625
Professor speaking.

77
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Private line with Palermo and Lisbon.

78
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,833
BARENTS SEA, FIVE YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

79
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,000
ALBERTO MENDOZA
INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER

80
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,333
Look, there's the platform.

81
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,000
The Bank of Spain adventure
began a long time ago,

82
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,750
in a remote region of the planet.

83
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,541
And like almost everything
in Berlin's life,

84
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:02,125
it started with another robbery,
the most surreal he had ever done.

85
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,041
Sir.

86
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,750
Stealing the extraction pump
from an oil platform.

87
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,333
That's where he met Bogotá.

88
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,333
That's our man, Santiago,
underwater welder.

89
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,625
He's been working on platforms
for over 20 years.

90
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,333
Working for 20 years
and now you want to be a thief.

91
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,208
With such rough hands.

92
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,708
Yours are so soft
I could use them to jerk off.

93
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,833
If you've been too scared
to leave this prison for 20 years,

94
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,416
I can only think of one explanation.
You're a coward.

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,375
And we can't run a heist with a coward.

96
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,666
You think this sea is for cowards?
You've come here wearing your mom's coat!

97
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,958
Let him go, unless you want to fly
like the cormorants.

98
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,666
Hey.

99
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
Why haven't you left?

100
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,750
Because I have seven kids.

101
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,000
Your wife's hips must be as worn out
as the wheel on a mill.

102
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:09,541
Seven kids with seven different women.

103
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,666
This guy is an endangered species.

104
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:20,583
We're the only two true romantics left
and look where the other one was hiding.

105
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
It's beautiful.

106
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,041
Can it move 90 tons of gold?

107
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,416
If any machine can do it, it's this one.

108
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,958
It extracts aggregates from the seabed
as if they were baby food.

109
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,583
Ladies!

110
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,916
Things upstairs are pretty fucked up.

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,666
I want the extraction pump connected
in two hours! Got it?

112
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,666
Got it!

113
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,166
We still have ten tons to melt.

114
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
We'll keep melting
while we get the gold out.

115
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,250
Come on! Today's the big day!
We'll be home for Christmas!

116
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,541
-Come on!
-Let's do this!

117
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,208
-Professor.
-Sierra took one of the cars.

118
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,291
-What?
-But we're going after her.

119
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,625
You let a woman
who just gave birth get away?

120
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,458
Did you sing lullabies
thinking you were a happy family?

121
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,916
What the hell happened?

122
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,125
I lost my mind for moment.

123
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,291
Sergio, listen to me.

124
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,583
You take care of catching her.

125
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,166
We'll stay here
and go ahead with the plan.

126
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,791
Good luck, brother.

127
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,291
Matías, come and help with the door.
We're going to negotiate.

128
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,291
Open up.

129
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,625
I have a gift for them.

130
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,666
First, I'll blow them up.

131
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
Then you can negotiate all you want.

132
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,000
Put the gun down.

133
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:14,958
No.

134
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,958
Are you going to say
you're here because of me?

135
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,916
I didn't ask you to rescue me.

136
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,500
Give me that.

137
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Give me the gun.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Give me the damn gun!
No one else is going to die here today!

139
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,666
That… That is our problem.

140
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,375
We want to be the good guys.

141
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
In war, there are no good guys.

142
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,291
Gandía killed Nairobi.

143
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,791
And what did we do?

144
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,833
Dress his wounds and get him out.

145
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,166
And what did he do?

146
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
He came back and killed Tokyo.

147
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,000
Now we're going to heal their wounds, too?

148
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,541
Why? So they can come back
and destroy us tomorrow?

149
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,208
You know why?

150
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Because we didn't have the balls

151
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,291
to kill people in cold blood
when we should have.

152
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,250
We used to have Berlin.

153
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,458
He took care of these things.
You knew him.

154
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,666
What would he have done with Gandía?

155
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,833
I'll tell you.

156
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,833
He would've executed him…

157
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,458
for killing Nairobi.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
Tokyo would still be alive.

159
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
If it had been up to me,

160
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,291
you'd be rotting
in the desert in Algeria right now.

161
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,916
And Nairobi and Tokyo

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
would still be alive.

163
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,583
So would the six soldiers who just died.

164
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,416
But here we are.

165
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,625
And you're still alive.

166
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,625
So don't fuck with me,
and try not to get anyone else killed.

167
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,416
Matías, the door.

168
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,916
Fuck, he's fucking everywhere!

169
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
It's a safety feature.
You can't turn it off.

170
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,083
We know where you are.
The car has geolocation.

171
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,541
This chase is absurd.

172
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,625
It sure is.

173
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,375
If you escape, you'll go to jail.

174
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,916
So, now you care if I go to jail
or are you trying to clear my name?

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,208
It's too late for that.

176
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,750
All Tamayo's done
is pour another shovelful of dirt on you.

177
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,791
I'm up to my neck in dirt, just like you.

178
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,875
You can't see it
because you think you're better than me.

179
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,333
Of course I do.

180
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,916
Tell that to Tokyo and Nairobi.
They're dead because of you.

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,625
You discovered
where we were hiding Rio within hours.

182
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,666
You could've done it months ago
instead of making a scene

183
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,333
and risking so many lives,
but that would've been too easy

184
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,875
for an ego as big as yours, right?

185
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,666
You didn't give a shit about that kid.

186
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,958
Or breakfast with crazy grandma
or walking on the beach with Paulita.

187
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,416
It's great on vacation, but every day?
What a drag!

188
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,041
One day you woke up,
looked in the mirror and said,

189
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,375
"Should I buy a minivan

190
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,708
or organize a goddamn heist
to get out of my fucking shitty life?"

191
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,333
Am I right? Or am I right?

192
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,291
What's wrong?

193
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,250
Sorry, honey.

194
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,916
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

195
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,875
You're going to spend the rest
of the heist tied up and gagged.

196
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,041
You wish.

197
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,333
I'm on the highway.
I'll cut her off from the front.

198
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,416
Copy.

199
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,541
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

200
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,125
Giddy-up, giddy-up, go, go, go!

201
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,458
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

202
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,666
Giddy-up, giddy-up

203
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,375
Giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

204
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,750
Giddy-up, giddy-up, go, go, go!

205
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,416
Giddy-up, giddy-up horsey…

206
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Marseille, move aside
or I'll run into you.

207
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,291
I won't move.

208
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,208
If you don't, you'll kill a mom and baby.
You're no murderer.

209
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,125
-I saw how you held her.
-Stop the car.

210
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't act crazy, Alicia!

211
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,625
I'm not acting crazy… I am crazy.

212
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,541
Professor, my tires are flat.

213
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,416
Professor!

214
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,500
I can't right now, Marseille. I can't.

215
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,791
Helsinki.

216
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,750
Helsinki, how are you?

217
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
If they had cut my leg off before,

218
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
I'd be recovered by now.

219
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,875
Stockholm…

220
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,500
Who died?

221
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,666
Tokyo.

222
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,916
I heard four grenades.

223
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,708
Who else?

224
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,916
Six soldiers.

225
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,708
It could've been worse.

226
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,666
Denver and Manila could have died too
and you could've been widowed today.

227
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,750
Yes.

228
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,583
Zbogom, Tokyo.

229
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,458
We should've attacked simultaneously
with several contingents.

230
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,458
That's the way
things are done, contingent…

231
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,375
Suárez!

232
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,875
Tamayo, those five soldiers had children.

233
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,041
Hernando, three kids.

234
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,083
Canalejas, twin girls
who aren't even a year old.

235
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,125
-Cobo, one kid and another on the way.
-What did you say?

236
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,958
-That Cobo was expecting--
-Fuck, that's it.

237
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,833
I want photos
of those soldiers with their kids,

238
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,208
eating chocolate,
with their pets, on vacation…

239
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,083
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,291
Make it look like a Christmas movie!

241
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,166
We have to show the world
those disfigured bodies, full of shrapnel.

242
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,666
We're going to parade them around
like the corpse of Che Guevara.

243
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,500
We'll bring everyone to tears.

244
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,708
What are you doing?

245
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,166
Do you want to turn their families' pain
into emotional porn?

246
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,166
Those Robin Hoods took down
five national heroes

247
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,916
and no one will cheer on
a bunch of murderers.

248
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,541
We're going to turn the red tide
into an oil spill.

249
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,541
Martínez, get Intelligence on the line,
information division.

250
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,833
This is crazy.

251
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,708
One wrong move and we open fire.

252
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,916
Don't look for anyone. They're all dead.

253
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
This is as far as you'll get.

254
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,541
Let's see if he's telling the truth.

255
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
Easy there, all right? Slow.

256
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,375
She was wearing this one.

257
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,458
It belongs to Cortés.

258
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,916
So, what are your terms?

259
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,500
My man needs a blood transfusion
and a surgeon. He leaves, I stay.

260
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,791
I'll be your prisoner
until the heist is over.

261
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,125
No. You stay, he stays
and a surgeon comes in.

262
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,583
Colonel Tamayo,

263
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:38,875
I need you to send a surgeon in
to treat Vázquez. They won't let us out.

264
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,666
You can count on it.

265
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,000
Hand me the radio.
Consider yourself my prisoner.

266
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you smoke?

267
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,291
I quit nine months ago
for health reasons, but frankly,

268
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,958
it's a bit contradictory.

269
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,125
What happened in there?

270
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,791
Oliveira pulled the pins on her grenades,

271
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,708
then she let us take her down.

272
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,791
When we went to finish her off,
her grenades exploded,

273
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,375
and so did my men's, in sympathy.

274
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,333
She wasn't one to give up easily.

275
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,958
She would've made a great soldier…
if she had chosen the right side.

276
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,208
You still think there's a right side?

277
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,208
I think the world is full of bastards.

278
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,125
Politicians are bastards.

279
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,416
But dictators are worse.

280
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,166
Us soldiers are also big fucking bastards.

281
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,583
But terrorists like you are even worse.

282
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,666
So, yeah, there are right sides.

283
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,083
Don't you think it's ironic?

284
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,833
That your violence is required
to keep the peace.

285
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,291
Do you want me to believe that you're here
to fight for a better world?

286
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,333
I'm here out of love
for a man and an idea.

287
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,625
You loved your commando.

288
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,708
We both knew this war was going to happen.

289
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,166
And yet, we led them towards death.

290
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:36,291
Maybe we did them a favor, I don't know.
Or condemned them to something worse.

291
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,166
There are no right sides in hell, Major.

292
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,875
They say that,
when someone dies tragically,

293
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,791
their spirit lingers for a while
in the place they died.

294
00:24:58,916 --> 00:24:59,791
And sometimes,

295
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,791
for a few seconds,

296
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,125
the living can feel
the dead they once loved.

297
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,083
And Rio felt it.

298
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,916
I wanted to tell him it was me,

299
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,583
that I hadn't fully left yet.

300
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,083
That I was at peace.

301
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,000
That I didn't suffer.

302
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,291
And so much more.

303
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,916
My mother came up with a trick for that.
It was a magic door.

304
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:35,041
If I ever got scared, I could open it
and she'd be on the other side.

305
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,375
This door will always be open for you.

306
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,916
You can use it whenever you want.

307
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,416
Thank you.

308
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,625
Look at us.

309
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,041
It's like we're in a scene from a movie.

310
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,625
Aiming at each other in the rain,

311
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,625
like in Liberty Valance.

312
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,791
Has anyone ever challenged you to a duel?

313
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,416
Rumor has it, the first to shoot
is more likely to survive.

314
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,250
Don't force me to test that theory.
Put the gun down.

315
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,375
Saving Rio was just an excuse.

316
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,291
An excuse to rescue yourself
from your boring life.

317
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,416
Right?

318
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,291
I've lived most of my life
without an identity.

319
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,541
Living in a hole like some ghost.

320
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,708
My life with Raquel has been a dream.

321
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,291
But I also have dreams of my own.

322
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,375
And by kidnapping Rio,
you made it so easy.

323
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:49,000
So you rescued the kid
to have a showdown with the State?

324
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,666
Some people dream of skydiving.

325
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,375
I didn't want to die
without robbing the Bank of Spain.

326
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:58,500
You egocentric, narcissistic
son of a bitch. God, I love being right.

327
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,125
Put it down or I'll shoot.

328
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,250
No, you won't.

329
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,000
Put the weapon down.

330
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,125
You won't shoot.

331
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,166
You won't shoot.

332
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,458
You bastard. I didn't think you'd shoot.

333
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,083
Good thing I emptied the clip.

334
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,166
Now we're tied.

335
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,083
We've both shot at each other,
both emptied our clips.

336
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,125
Time for a tiebreaker?

337
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,166
Should I shoot?

338
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,916
What are we going to do?

339
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,875
Tokyo died
because she was fed up with paradise.

340
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,458
Because, one day, she woke up

341
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,708
and was tired of paradise.

342
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,166
And I get that.

343
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,500
I had my paradise.

344
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,291
I lived on the beach, far from the city,

345
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,000
60 miles away.

346
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,333
But every Friday,
I came up with a new excuse

347
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,625
to go out partying
because I had to set myself on fire.

348
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,958
I didn't grow up as much as I thought.

349
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,208
Honey, we used to go out
every fucking day.

350
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,500
We've grown up a little.

351
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,375
I didn't fit into that life.

352
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,541
And that makes me sad.

353
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:45,666
You know what I reminisced about
in my paradise?

354
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,000
About us.

355
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,125
Us and how we were always
the last to leave the club.

356
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,750
I called you early one morning
from a phone booth.

357
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,625
It rang once and I hung up.

358
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
You had a missed call
from Indonesia, right?

359
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,416
I had a missed call from Indonesia

360
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,250
at 1:15 in the morning.

361
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,166
That was because of the time difference.

362
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:17,791
Are you telling me that in paradise,

363
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,500
on a fucking awesome remote beach,

364
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,833
watching the sunrise,

365
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,666
you thought about me, Dani?

366
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,375
A lot.

367
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,750
About Sundays
when they turned the lights on at the club

368
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,083
and our feet were stuck to the floor?

369
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,041
That's what you missed
while you were in paradise?

370
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,791
Well,

371
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,833
that sucks.

372
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,666
Because now I don't know what to do.

373
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,500
I swear I came here thinking,
"I'm going to go for it, I don't care."

374
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,708
You can't waste your life
wanting to be with someone.

375
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,708
But then I saw you, and I said, "No."

376
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,333
"Stop, Julia. You better not."

377
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,500
And now you tell me this and…

378
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,375
I don't know what to do.

379
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,875
You're putting this whole mess
and responsibility on me.

380
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,416
What responsibility?

381
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,583
Stepping aside.

382
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,375
Denver, Manila, the surgeon is here.

383
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,583
You have to take him to the wounded.

384
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,166
-Denver.
-Coming.

385
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,125
On my way.

386
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,208
Hey, it's no big deal.

387
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,166
No big deal.

388
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,583
No big deal.

389
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,500
Come on, Victoria. Let's go.

390
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,208
Let me tell you something,
and as a mom this time.

391
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,541
You were wrong to give up your life
in Thailand to steal a country's gold.

392
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,208
You know why?

393
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,541
Ultimately, what one misses
isn't the thrill of being a criminal.

394
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,708
It's the comfort of family.

395
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,916
Just so you know.

396
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,416
Look. This is Emilio, my eldest.
He lives in Venezuela.

397
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:55,375
This is Julián, he's in Mexico City.
He calls me "güey."

398
00:33:56,916 --> 00:34:00,500
Hanna, violinist. A beauty. In Finland.

399
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,166
This is Drazen, he's in Montenegro.

400
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,291
When I call to wish him a happy birthday
he says, "Thank you, sir."

401
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:10,458
This is Ivana.
She's got a temper. She's an artist.

402
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,125
A blonde one, a black one, a redhead…

403
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,833
I'd say they all take after
their mom and dad,

404
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,500
but I think they all take after their mom.

405
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,708
Here comes the foreman.

406
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,541
We've sabotaged this priceless pump

407
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,416
to get it out of here.

408
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,083
Tell him we're going to steal it from him.

409
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,791
Tell him that we're also taking
this gentleman here with us.

410
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:09,250
He spends so much time alone under water,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

411
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,583
that he's realized his wallet is full

412
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,208
of photos of the 7 families he hasn't had.

413
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,750
His kids call him "güey" and "sir"
because no one calls a stranger "Dad."

414
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

415
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,541
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just in photos.

416
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,000
By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

417
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,750
He's going to have to pay us
to rob him. Translate, sir.

418
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,541
This guy is awesome.
Ask him if he has a sister.

419
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,625
Backpack on the conveyor belt.
Go that way. Move!

420
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:56,958
Move.

421
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,541
Double open fracture
of the radius and ulna.

422
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:09,208
Bullet in the lower third of the leg,
no exit wound.

423
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,041
Hemorrhage due to perforation
in the torso.

424
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,041
All yours, doctor.

425
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,750
This is the next man
you need to operate on.

426
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,166
My leg is crushed.

427
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,583
Femoral fracture and displaced patella.

428
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,708
The tibia and fibula
are probably shattered as well,

429
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,375
with femoral torsion.

430
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:33,500
With a possible tear, not too big.
We controlled bleeding with compression.

431
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,125
It's like a butcher shop.

432
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,333
Surgery like bullfighter, doctor.

433
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,291
But he goes first.

434
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,541
Colonel, something's happening.

435
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:55,083
They're sending information from the bank.
It is a real-time video, a live feed.

436
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,708
Block it at all costs.

437
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,583
I can't. I block one signal
and 100 more come up.

438
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,833
Then I want to see it.
Put it on the screen.

439
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:08,750
We're recording this video
to share some important information.

440
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,000
Seven people died today

441
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,916
inside the Bank of Spain.

442
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,291
Six soldiers and Silene Oliveira,

443
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,250
Tokyo.

444
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,916
A few years ago,

445
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:29,166
I thought Tokyo was one of those people

446
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,375
who was unable to reflect
when they caused pain.

447
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,625
I thought she was a murderer,
that she had no feelings.

448
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,583
And then, I got to know her.

449
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,666
I slapped her once.

450
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,250
We were on a beach and…

451
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,708
she didn't trust me

452
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,833
and I thought that her plan

453
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,416
to rescue Aníbal Cortés

454
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,708
was nothing more
than the whim of a spoiled brat

455
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,500
who feels guilty.

456
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,458
I later realized

457
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,708
she was doing it out of love.

458
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,083
Very few people in this world

459
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:25,833
are capable of braving the impossible
to save someone.

460
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:26,958
Today, I know

461
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,291
that we failed.

462
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,791
I am pained by the loss of these lives.

463
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,916
On behalf of all of us,
I ask for your forgiveness

464
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,833
for having turned a rescue mission

465
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,958
into a war with casualties.

466
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:46,833
Starting today,

467
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,458
we are no longer someone to follow,

468
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,291
cheer on,

469
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,583
and applaud.

470
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,208
We're never getting out of here.

471
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:07,375
So we ask that everyone
who believed in us,

472
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:10,500
the great red tide supporting us
outside the bank,

473
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,916
to please go home.

474
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,166
We're not leaving!

475
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,375
We're not leaving!

476
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:02,000
We're not leaving!

477
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,250
We're not leaving!

478
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:13,333
That bitch has beaten us to it!
The first to talk defines the truth.

479
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,166
If we tell our side
of this Christmas story,

480
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,000
it won't be worth shit.

481
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:22,041
That crybaby has beaten us
with her sentimental manipulation.

482
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,166
With one small difference.

483
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,458
Her feelings are real.

484
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,583
Consuelo, what's wrong?

485
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,708
The surgeon told me that

486
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,750
Arturo is alive.

487
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:11,875
That's great.

488
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I hit rock-bottom.

489
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,458
I couldn't take it anymore.

490
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,000
But I'm here, I'm back.

491
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,875
-I don't know where--
-Wait.

492
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:38,833
Yes.

493
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,916
A little while ago, up there,

494
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,875
you almost died.

495
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:59,333
And I can't even begin to imagine what
it'd be like to live without you, Denver.

496
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,333
I can't.

497
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,583
It was a wake-up call.

498
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,916
And I don't know.

499
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,166
I don't know
if we'll get out of here alive, but…

500
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,958
if something happens, Denver,
I don't want it to be when we're angry,

501
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,291
or distant or doubtful,
because I have no doubts.

502
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,458
I love you.

503
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,541
I love you a lot, too.

504
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,208
I know.

505
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,666
Nothing could ever
be more important than that.

506
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,750
Besides…

507
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:52,875
we already know
it's possible to love during a heist.

508
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,750
I fell in love during one.

509
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,208
Consuelo?

510
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,083
Consuelo, it's me.

511
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:42,958
Consuelo?

512
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,541
We've been waiting for you.

513
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,250
I love your house.

514
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,125
Are you okay?

515
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,833
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-No swearing.

516
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:10,083
At this age, they're like sponges.
I don't want you traumatizing her.

517
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,833
So, good vibes, smile.

518
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,625
Touch one hair on my wife's head
and I'll kill you.

519
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,458
Are you really threatening me?

520
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,958
The guy who didn't
send reinforcements into the bank

521
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:22,708
because the Professor
had him by the balls?

522
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,958
I don't know where you heard that,
but it's a lie.

523
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,291
I was there, in his hideout,

524
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,000
listening to him blackmail you
with a few recordings.

525
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,416
We'd better talk about that in private.

526
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,916
I'm sure your wife knows
just how despicable you are.

527
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,625
Okay.

528
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,791
Where is the Professor?

529
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,583
Voilà!

530
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,791
"What are you wearing, Colonel?"

531
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,458
He's in my custody.

532
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,791
I could put a ribbon on him
and hand him over.

533
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,208
What do you want?

534
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,375
Shut your fucking mouth.

535
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,791
Retract all the lies you told about me.

536
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,541
Resign from your position
and assume full responsibility.

537
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,541
It's your duty.

538
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:52,041
And then you hand the Professor
over on a silver platter.

539
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,666
Like a hero.

540
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,500
For your great service to the nation.

541
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,958
What if I don't fucking feel like it?

542
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,666
If you don't feel like it,
I'll pull a Raquel Murillo.

543
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,833
I'll switch sides,
with all that it entails,

544
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,208
and drink caipirinhas with the Professor.

545
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,458
Assuming you have the Professor
and hand him over to me, which I doubt,

546
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,375
do you think I'm going
to incriminate myself and go to jail

547
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,708
just so this man doesn't get his way?

548
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,166
No way.

549
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,583
We're both better off free than in jail.

550
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:51,208
Fuck, I've even started to like him.
It's a figure of speech, honey.

551
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,166
The real dilemma is this.

552
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,875
Either you shoot me now

553
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,000
and don't get out of jail
until your son's balls are wrinkly…

554
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:03,083
It's a girl, you asshole.

555
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,875
…or give me the gun
and maybe you'll get a reduced sentence,

556
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:10,125
because about three minutes ago
I hit the panic button on the alarm.

557
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:13,416
The police are about
to come through that fucking door.

558
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,875
3 LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ ST.

559
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,250
LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ

560
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,250
Tamayo.

561
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,791
Who is it?

562
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,416
Good afternoon. I have a certified letter
for apartment 5C.

563
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,333
Could you buzz me in
so I can leave him the notice?

564
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,875
Let's go.

565
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,875
Let's go.

566
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,625
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

567
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,166
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

568
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,500
I told you.
Now you have no choice but to trust me.

569
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,208
-Let's go, quick!
-Hello?

570
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,333
Can I leave the notice with you?

571
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:12,375
Sure.

572
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,125
