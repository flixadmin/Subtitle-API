The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

164
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,816
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

165
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,486
for the pain, which is unimaginable.

166
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,532
And then three days
to three weeks, you're dead.

167
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,037
That is what will happen
to those boys.

And what about us?

169

Well, we've...

170
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,007
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

171
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,177
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

172
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,305
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

173
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,517
So, in time, cancer.

174

Or aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

Well...

176
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:08,033

gotten off easy then, Valery.

why I wanted to take a walk.

the work site is bugged.

They've been here the whole time.

182
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,568
Of course, they've been here
the whole time.

183
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,698
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

184
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,451
it's because they want us to know.

Yes.

There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

193
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,848
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

194
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,854
Why did it explode?

195
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,858

conditions in an RBMK reactor.

To an extent.

306
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,077
Of course.

307

So what's the job?

308

We need to install a liquid

underneath this concrete pad.

310
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,478
There's no way to approach
from the interior of the building,

311
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,897
so you have to get at it
from underground.

00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:13,442
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,862
which is melting down.

Essentially.

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,204
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

317
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,081
Not if you're done within six weeks.

318
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,002
Dimensions?

319
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,007
Break ground here,

320
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,467
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

321
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,512
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

for the heat exchanger.

323
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,559
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

324
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,436
you can't use any heavy machinery.

325
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,937
It has to be done by hand.

326
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,690

I don't know.

491
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,394
Was it...

492
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,479
Of course it was.

493
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm working on it.

494
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,151
- Boris...
- I'm working on it.

495
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,737
What more do you want from me?

496
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,781
Fix your tie.

497
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,495
(DOOR OPENS)

498
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,873
They'll see you now.

499
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,720
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

500
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,014
successfully extinguished the fire.

501
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,932
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

502
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,476
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

503
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,272
And furthermore, there's no longer
a threat of additional explosion.

504
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,776
The Soviet people have faced
the challenge and risen to the task,

505
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,696
and they and everyone in this room
are to be commended.

506
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,454
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

507
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,873
to protect the security
interests of the State.

508
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,626
And since the unfortunate
release of information

509
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,461
directly following the accident,

510
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,588
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

511
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,381
Comrade Charkov,

512
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:03,178
we hope we have lived up to
the highest standards of the KGB.

513
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,679
You have.

514
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,514
SHCHERBINA: Thank you.

515
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,437
Professor Legasov will now speak
about the work that remains.

516
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,565
Thank you.

517
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,656
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

518
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,032
and it is good.

519
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,952
The immediate danger is over.

520
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,829
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

521
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,001
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

522
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,795
and contamination spread out
across a zone

523
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,214
of approximately
2,600-square kilometers.

524
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:43,635
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

525
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:48,306
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

526
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,562
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

527
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:57,399
whether domesticated or wild,

528
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:01,903
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

529
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,656
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

530
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,660
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

531
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:14,207
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

532
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,919
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

533
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:21,381
which will be carried by the wind
and the rain if left exposed.

534
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,633
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

535
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:25,927
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

536
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,387
and bury it under itself,

537
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,473
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

538
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,354
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

539
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:40,775
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

540
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,778
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

541
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,950
There will be deaths.

542
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,372
What amount of time,

543
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,082
and how many men do you require?

544
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,669
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

545
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,338
and approximately 750,000 men,

546
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:06,259
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

547
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,304
How many deaths?

548
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,723
Thousands.

549
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,933
Perhaps tens of thousands.

550
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,318
GORBACHEV: Begin at once.

551
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,659
LEGASOV: Comrade Charkov.
SHCHERBINA: Valery!

552
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:34,871
Yes, Professor?

553
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,000
My associate was arrested last night.

554
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,543
Oh?

555
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,670
I mean no disrespect,

556
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,714
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

557
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,841
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

558
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,843
She was arrested by the KGB.

559
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:52,889
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

560
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:54,349
I am.

561
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,310
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

562
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,771
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

563
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,025
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

564
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,069
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

565
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,072
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

566
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,450
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

567
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,494
But we are not what people say.

568
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,788
Yes, people are following you.

569
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,082
People are following those people.

570
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,042
You see them?

571
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:24,838
They follow me.

572
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:29,008
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

573
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,844
Nothing more.

574
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,512
You know the work we're doing here.

575
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,974
You really don't trust us?

576
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:37,433
Of course, I do.

577
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,811
But you know the old Russian proverb.

578
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,105
"Trust but verify."

579
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,278
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

580
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:49,404
Can you imagine?

581
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,240
It was very nice speaking with you.

582
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,742
I need her.

583
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,914
So you will be accountable for her?

584
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:05,628
Then it's done.

585
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,048
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

586
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,467
Good day, Professor.

587
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,814
Well, that went surprisingly well.

588
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,317
You came off like a naive idiot.

589
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,279
And naive idiots are not a threat.

590
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,255
I'll come back when
the paperwork's complete.

591
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,555
(LOCK CLICKING)

592
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,765
Are you all right?

593
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,058
They didn't hurt me.

594
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,729
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

595
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,856
(EXHALES) It doesn't matter.

596
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,901
They were stupid. I was stupid.

597
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,571
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

598
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,700
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

599
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,079
Valery,

600
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,789
Akimov...

601
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,500
His face was gone.

602
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,088
You want to stop?

603
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,133
Is that a choice I even have?

604
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:46,145
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

605
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,440
I don't know. A 40% chance, maybe.

606
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,529
I said 50. (SCOFFS)

607
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,657
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing.

608
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,825
"Maybe."

609
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,622
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

610
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,834
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

611
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,585
will save millions of lives.

612
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,172
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

613
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,095
I don't want to do this anymore.

614
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,223
I want to stop.

615
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,351
But I can't.

616
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,647
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

617
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,444
I think, despite the stupidity,

618
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,904
the lies, even this,

619
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,157
you are compelled.

620
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,535
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

621
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,911
until you find an answer.

622
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,622
Because that is who you are.

623
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,168
A lunatic, then.

624
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:53,755
A scientist.

625
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,841
(LOCK CLICKING)

626
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,279
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

627
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,157
Yeah.

628
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,367
There's something else.

629
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,413
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

630
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:29,415
and Toptunov confirms it.

631
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,250
They pressed AZ-5.

632
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,252
Apparently not soon enough.

633
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:34,837
No.

634
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:39,258
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

635
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,095
and then the reactor exploded.

636
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,183
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

637
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,144
faulty memory or delusion even,

638
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,939
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

639
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,653
Comrade?

640
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,782
Do you think it's possible?

641
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,450
I think it makes no sense. I...

642
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,413
I think it's what I would say if
I was trying to cover my own mistakes.

643
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,039
But?

644
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,458
I believe them.

645
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,712
Then you should pursue it.

646
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,966
We have to pursue every possibility,

647
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,677
no matter how unlikely,

648
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,847
no matter what or who's to blame.

649
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,394
I'll go back to the hospital
and re-interview Akimov and Toptunov.

650
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:35,982
If they're still awake.

651
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,818
They're not.

652
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:42,155
