1
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,475
Tea.

2
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,176
It is about time!

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,181
Oh!

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,817
Hey, tohru,

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,653
the Japanese cultural expo
starts tomorrow.

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,257
Wall-to-wall music, food,
and the coolest techno gear.

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,492
(Groans)

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,727
Uh, something the matter?

9
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,997
Uncle: Forgetting tea
is what is the matter!

10
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,966
This is a pot of water.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,102
Oh, sorry.

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,745
You've been acting
all weird lately.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,249
Come on,
you can tell me.

14
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,851
It's uncle, right?
That garlic smell?

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,487
It's my mother.

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,624
What, is she sick or--
you have a mom?

17
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,292
She is arriving
from Japan

18
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,760
to attend the expo.

19
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,529
She is a big fan
of kare noke

20
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,497
and her yodeling
kabukis.

21
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,801
The screechy
country singer? Yuck!

22
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,203
But what's so yuck about
a visit from your mom?

23
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,504
(Groans)

24
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,474
I am the black sheep.

25
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:16,642
All I've ever wanted

26
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,677
was for my mother
to be proud of me.

27
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,380
Well, she will be.
Look at you.

28
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,848
You're handsome and...

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,216
Big.

30
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,418
You've got, uh...
You're big.

31
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,787
You do not understand.

32
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,190
My mother is very hard
to please.

33
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:35,961
Tea.

34
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,663
Thank you.

35
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:38,931
(Gasps)

36
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,741
(Gasps)

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,104
Mommy.

38
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,806
Mommy?
- Mommy?

39
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,477
This where you live?

40
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,680
(Groans)

41
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,015
You gave up good job

42
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,517
with nice
Mr. valmont
for this?

43
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,052
Nice?

44
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,988
Hello? Doesn't she know
valmont's a crook?

45
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,291
No, and please
do not tell her.

46
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,127
My son...

47
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,196
A servant
in a junk shop!

48
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,697
Junk shop?

49
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,532
This is an antique store.

50
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,702
Huh! Only antique I see
is the Billy goat there.

51
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,871
Billy goat!

52
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,439
Mommy.
Hush up!

53
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,977
Dragon lady
should watch
her forked tongue

54
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,613
unless she wants
a piece of uncle.

55
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,716
Huh! I would sweep floor
with you.

56
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,518
And this floor needs it.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,652
Ugh.

58
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,325
Evil eye
cannot work on me.

59
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,994
Huh! What junk seller
know about work?

60
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,031
Please, both of you.

61
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,666
Tohru's mother
has jet lag

62
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,468
from her long flight.

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,903
My uncle is stressed

64
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,405
from working all night
on translations.

65
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,540
(Telephone rings)

66
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,275
Phone call.

67
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,409
Hello?

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,477
Hope I didn't catch you

69
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,979
in the middle of anything,
Jackie.

70
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,215
Uh, uncle and tohru's mom
are getting acquainted.

71
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,352
Ah. Family time.

72
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,586
Mom: Cheap junk.

73
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,054
Tsing dynasty.

74
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,423
Black: Could be trouble
brewing on the horizon.

75
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,591
Oh!

76
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,260
Believe me, I know.

77
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,129
The octopus will be on exhibit
at the Japanese expo.

78
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,697
I'd feel better
if you were there

79
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,266
to assist with security.

80
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,635
Uh, you want me
to guard a fish?

81
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:33,305
Actually, octopuses aren't
fish. They're multipods.

82
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,573
Octopi.

83
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,208
Please behave!

84
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,409
Sorry.

85
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,811
Grammar was never
my best subject in school.

86
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,748
Oh, you mean
the Kyoto octopus.

87
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,016
It is the most
famous relic

88
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,550
of the komodo
dynasty.

89
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,352
Intelligence sources indicate

90
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,954
that the yokanawa
crime family

91
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,856
has the octopus
in its sights.

92
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,892
Huh! Why don't
you get some
light in here?

93
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,061
Thought bats could see
in the dark.

94
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,496
This must stop!

95
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,665
My thinking exactly.

96
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,799
I'll set it up.

97
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,634
Thanks for you help,
Jackie.

98
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,702
Huh?

99
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,838
Ugh. Dragon lady
waste of my energy.

100
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,206
Must get back
to work.

101
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,875
Fine!

102
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,843
Show me my room,
tohru.

103
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,944
Uncle: No room here!

104
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,946
What do you think,
this is a hotel?

105
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,648
Only for roaches.

106
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,524
Your hotel, mommy.

107
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,127
A boy your age,
doesn't even own a car.

108
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,630
Makes his mother
walk in a typhoon!

109
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,169
Oh.

110
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,440
Does it have fish?

111
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,508
This is a Sushi
restaurant.

112
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,644
Everything has fish.

113
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,112
I hate fish.

114
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,615
Miso soup. Uh, small.

115
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,320
Hey, isn't that
the mountain

116
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,823
that does the
knuckle crunching
for valmont?

117
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,324
Not anymore.

118
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,693
Ain't you heard?
He's gone straight.

119
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,996
The bigger they are,
the faster they go soft.

120
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,433
Ha ha! Looks like
a real mama's boy.

121
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,075
Your soup.

122
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,014
(Slurps)

123
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,753
(Panting)

124
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,702
Can I offer you a ride?

125
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,537
I will walk.

126
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,472
Come on, tohru.

127
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,875
It is tohru, isn't it?

128
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,177
I'll drop you
anywhere you say.

129
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,379
Oh.

130
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,324
Boss: Plush, right?

131
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,794
This baby's outfitted
with the works.

132
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,595
Fridge, computer...

133
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,398
Tohru: Soda?

134
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,167
May I have the grape?

135
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,135
Sure.
Whatever you like.

136
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,274
Ahh.

137
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,142
Grape is my favorite.

138
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,545
That's 'cause
you got good taste.

139
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,846
So, uh, tohru,

140
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,314
I got a proposition
for you.

141
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,415
No, thank you.

142
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,483
Just hear me out.

143
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,452
This isn't just
some 2-bit heist.

144
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,154
What I've got in mind
has 8 legs

145
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,256
and is loaded with jewels.

146
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,896
You will kidnap
kare noke

147
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,731
and her yodeling
kabukis?

148
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,900
Kare noke
and her--ha ha ha!

149
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,803
I love this guy!

150
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,104
No, my friend.

151
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,674
I'm talking about
the Kyoto octopus.

152
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,311
I don't think so.

153
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,113
Hey, for old time's sake.
Serious payday.

154
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,917
Could buy yourself a car
just like this one.

155
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,752
Make your mom proud.

156
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,160
Must call landlord,

157
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,229
tell him to spray
for vermin.

158
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,930
Button your lip, windbag.

159
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,899
I am here to see my boy.

160
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,300
Tohru is out.
Where?

161
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,435
Do not know.

162
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,270
Huh! Lousy boss.

163
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,539
Can't keep track
of own employees.

164
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,673
That's not fair.

165
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,975
Uncle's a great boss,

166
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,610
and tohru loves it here.

167
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,678
You are a sweet girl,

168
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,180
very cute.

169
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,849
But please
do not speak of matters

170
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,252
beyond your
understanding, child.

171
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,754
Should have seen tohru

172
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,856
when he worked
for Mr. valmont.

173
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,224
Had his own room.

174
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,359
Big!

175
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,861
Always a spare bed
for his mother.

176
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,963
Valmont? Ah.
Valmont was a--

177
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,031
uncle!

178
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,500
Uh, heh. Ix-nay
on the almont-vay.

179
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,905
Ah, child speaks
many languages.

180
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,107
And look at you!

181
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,975
Cannot even
speak English!

182
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,911
Speak English
better than you!

183
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,012
Do not!
Do, too!

184
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,613
In your dreams,
junk monger!

185
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,781
Eyah!

186
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,516
Hyah!
Kak-kak-kyah!

187
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,523
Oh.

188
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,133
Mom: Gave up good job with
nice Mr. valmont for this?

189
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,268
Servant in a junk shop!

190
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,470
Boss: Kyoto octopus.

191
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,439
Black: Serious payday.

192
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,841
Boss: Buy yourself a car
just like this one.

193
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,043
Tohru: Grape.

194
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,178
Uncle: Cheap?!
I am not cheap!

195
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,148
Ha! I see the rags
tohru wears.

196
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,550
Same clothes
as when he worked
for valmont.

197
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,185
Jackie:
Ah! I have no time

198
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,454
to play referee
for the both of you.

199
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,256
Must get over
to the expo.

200
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,693
Play security guard
for an octopus.

201
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,098
Boss: You made
a wise choice,
tohru.

202
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,466
What do I do?

203
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,001
Nothing fancy.

204
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,869
You cruise
into the expo,

205
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,404
create a diversion.

206
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,740
Meanwhile, my boys
make an end run,

207
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,642
nab the octopus.

208
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,978
One tiny problem, tohru.

209
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,679
Word is,
you double-crossed

210
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,481
your old boss valmont.

211
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,983
That you're a rat.

212
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,651
I am no rat.

213
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,885
Yeah? Prove it!

214
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,687
I have information.

215
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,991
Yeah?

216
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:30,662
Um, Jackie chan will be
working security at the expo.

217
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,464
I heard of him.

218
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,399
They say
he's unbeatable.

219
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,802
Nobody is unbeatable.

220
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,939
I trust you'll take care

221
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,608
of this Jackie chan
personally, tohru.

222
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,577
And I mean permanently.

223
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,984
(Chatter)

224
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,927
Whoa!

225
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,829
Jade, how did you
get in here?

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,531
Security's lousy.

227
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,334
You have to leave.
Things could get ugly.

228
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,806
Go! Go! Go!

229
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,281
Not on
my salary.

230
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,760
Aah!

231
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,236
Wha...?

232
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,906
A little backup!

233
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,312
Tohru?

234
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,517
Whah!

235
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,153
I knew we couldn't
trust this guy!

236
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,555
Whoa! Unh.

237
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,527
Whoa.

238
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,098
Octo-jacking
in progress.

239
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,500
Ow!

240
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,768
Banzai!

241
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,541
Thank you
for the tip-off, tohru.

242
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,709
Of course.

243
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,911
Your mom will be very proud.

244
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,881
Tohru has a mom?

245
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,183
(Gasps)

246
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,619
The octopus!

247
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,858
And this one's
not just a smokescreen!

248
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,031
(Both groaning)

249
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,568
(Tohru grunting)

250
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,670
Oh.

251
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,511
Oh!

252
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,814
Jackie and tohru!
Where?

253
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,182
Uh, here's the deal:

254
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,750
You give us the octopus,

255
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,486
or your boys
do a meet-and-greet

256
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,788
with a shark.

257
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,056
Market street Sushi bar.
One hour.

258
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,725
Come through
the front door,

259
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,326
and come alone.

260
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,895
Well?

261
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,096
No problem.

262
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,064
Trade octopus
for young ones.

263
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,400
Wait, one problem.

264
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,501
What?

265
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,236
I have no octopus.

266
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,539
Jade: You do now.

267
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,142
Pretty good
for a child, huh?

268
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,146
Well, what are we
waiting for?

269
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,981
Tohru and Jackie need us.

270
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,716
Us, not you.

271
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,618
Me, not us.

272
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,821
Youngster-nappers
say come alone.

273
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,622
Ha! Foolish
old junk monger

274
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,858
cannot handle
this alone.

275
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,626
Uh, why don't I just--

276
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,795
no!
- No!
Hmmph.

277
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,363
I will phone
captain black.

278
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,464
In the meantime,

279
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,667
stay here and
watch the shop.

280
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,339
Watch the shop, huh?

281
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,608
Well...

282
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,043
Watched it.

283
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,515
Nobody
double-crosses

284
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,784
the yokanawa mob,
tohru.

285
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,719
You just made
the biggest,

286
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,588
dumbest,
and last mistake

287
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,889
of your life.

288
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,091
But you have a deal, right?

289
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,794
Once you get the octopus,
you set us free.

290
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:26,030
Ha ha! Once we get
the octopus,

291
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,600
you and your chum
are gonna <i> be</i> chum.

292
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,238
Fish bait.

293
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,506
I do not like fish.

294
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,085
Hey, check this out,
boys.

295
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,753
Walkin' the dog.

296
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,158
Wha...?
- Hey!

297
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,929
Uncle!
Mommy!

298
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,898
Hey, I said
front door

299
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,232
and to come
alone!

300
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,433
I told her.

301
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,369
See, I told you!

302
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,137
Ah! Would have
lost your way!

303
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,305
Near-sighted mule

304
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,806
can barely
see hook nose

305
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,008
in front
of his face.

306
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,010
Eyesight good enough
to see the hair

307
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,912
growing out
of that mole!

308
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,947
That is
a beauty mark!

309
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,081
Quit the squabblin',

310
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,384
and put the fish
on the table.

311
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,551
Uh, boss?

312
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,619
Technically,

313
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,954
an octopus
is a member

314
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,156
of the multipod
family, and--

315
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,225
put the fish
on the table!

316
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,427
Uncle, don't!

317
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,129
Jackie, be quiet!

318
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,166
There. Now we all go home.

319
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,336
What say we make it
a family affair?

320
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,438
Throw 'em all in the tank!

321
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,446
Eyee! Yak-kak-kah!

322
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,318
Whoa. Nice move.

323
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,054
You watching, junk man?

324
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,656
Watching,
but seeing nothing special.

325
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,161
Hand is quicker than the eye.

326
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,862
Hyah!

327
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:05,997
Unh.

328
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,700
But should have been
watching the foot.

329
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,939
Unh.

330
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,177
Ah,
get this over with.

331
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,346
I came a long way to
hear kare noke sing.

332
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,015
Ha!
You call that singing?

333
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,817
(Sings out of tune)

334
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,286
Tone-deaf owl

335
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,388
is cruising
for a bruising!

336
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,302
Another trick
I've been working on.

337
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,240
Oh.

338
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,576
Jackie! Tohru!

339
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,878
Jade, what are you
doing here?

340
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,447
Oh, never mind.
Give us a hand!

341
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,182
Oh, no, you don't!

342
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,685
Whoa!

343
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,653
Unh.

344
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,266
Whoa!

345
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,667
Tohru: Oh!

346
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,903
(Both gurgling)

347
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,241
Aah!

348
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,027
(Jade struggling)

349
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,062
Jade!

350
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,330
I'm ok.

351
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Mommy?

352
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,135
Uncle?

353
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,305
<i>No Ms.</i>

354
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,879
(Gasps)

355
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,380
Where is
the octopus?

356
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,316
Mr. yo-yo mob took it.

357
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,262
Well, I'm sure
he's miles away by now.

358
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,565
Wha...?

359
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,773
Hey!

360
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,378
Unh.

361
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,883
My favorite trick--
around the world.

362
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,755
Nice work, Jackie.

363
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,459
I am very sorry

364
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,728
for the unpleasantness,
mommy.

365
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,831
My brave little boy.

366
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,800
You make
your mother proud.

367
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,303
I am glad that
you are not hurt.

368
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,705
And also glad
you are with people

369
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,807
who care about you.

370
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,344
Jackie, Jade,
the Billy goat.

371
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,579
Hmmph.

372
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,017
I will show you
a Billy goat!

373
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,351
Hyah!

374
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,519
Hyah!

375
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,122
Ayee-yak-yak-yah!

376
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,993
Whoa. Oh, no!
Stop it, both of you!

377
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,195
Looks like
the beginning

378
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,197
of a beautiful
relationship.

379
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,433
Uh, want to go back
to the Japanese expo?

380
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,169
I have heard kare noke
and her yodeling kabukis

381
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,772
put on a very good show.

382
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,209
Jackie: Uncle! Tohru's mommy!
Mom: Eyaah-kak-kak-kah!

383
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,244
Don't! Oh!

384
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,046
Uncle: Hyah! Eeyah!

385
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,219
Man: Hey, Jackie,

386
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,054
what's your favorite
kind of music?

387
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,389
I like rock songs
because it makes me,

388
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,158
like, uh,
when I'm training,

389
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,559
I like this kind
of music.

390
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,961
Celine Dion,

391
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,362
Mariah Carey,

392
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,030
Whitney Houston.

393
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:37,802
I really can hear
what is she saying.

394
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,604
Then I can practice
my English.

395
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,938
So many...

396
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,740
Bee gees, carpenter,

397
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,875
abba. Beatles? No.

398
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,377
I'm too young.
