How so?

You make a move,
and I break your face.

1718
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,240
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1719

This is the Mandarin?

Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,880
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1723
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,840
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1724
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,720

Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,720
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,920
But we also have to figure out this

-vice president thing, right?
-Right.

1750

I wonder who I'm calling right now.

Welcome back to the land of the living.

1756
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,520
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1757
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,120
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1758
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,920
Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1759
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,240
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1760
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,640
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1761
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,760
I think we're good, here.

RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,920
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1765
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,280
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,600
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,600
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1774
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,760
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,600
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
