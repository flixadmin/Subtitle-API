
1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,692
He's dead!
Come on!

2
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:12,900
What...

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,983
Up she goes...

4
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,817
Where is it you're from, anyway?

5
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,858
He wants us to help him find those stars.

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,400
Nori?

7
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:34,942
Duty demanded I return to Middle-earth.

8
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:38,567
It wasn't Elves that chased me
from my homeland. It was Orcs.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,775
Was that the mark of your people's king?

10
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:41,900
My people have no king.

11
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:54,400
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

12
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:55,942
Taking a last look?

13
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,733
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

14
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,567
But the Men who live here have not.

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,775
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

16
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:07,442
- Someone dug this passage.
- Something. Men did not do this.

17
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,067
Get to it.

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,025
You there! Anchor him.

19
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:38,233
Toss him out with the rest.

20
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,900
You toss him out with the rest.
I had sun duty yesterday.

21
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,608
You'll stay in the sun
till you're black as coal

22
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,858
if Adar wills it.

23
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:49,983
For Adar, then.
But not for you!

24
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,858
For Adar.

25
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,275
Rest's over, slothabout.

26
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,483
Now dig.

27
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,567
She lives.

28
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,483
Our hosts.
Saviors or captors?

29
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,608
It's not poisoned.
If that's your concern.

30
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,108
Not for humans, anyway.

31
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,775
One of the Eldar.
Onboard my ship?

32
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,483
Strange tides indeed.

33
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,900
What vessel is this?

34
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,483
Be at ease. I'm obliged to deliver you
safely to my betters.

35
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,900
They will answer your questions, not I.

36
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,608
To what port do we sail?

37
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,317
See for yourself.
We're nearly there.

38
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,233
Nearly where?

39
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,150
Home.

40
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,400
What is this place?

41
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,108
There is only one place it can be.

42
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,858
The Land of the Star.

43
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,400
The westernmost of all mortal realms.

44
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:02,233
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

45
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,942
Harbor speed!

46
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,983
- Is that an Elf?
- See nothin'...

47
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,983
Since when did Men like me
build kingdoms such as this?

48
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,900
These Men are not like you.

49
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:14,733
In the Great War,
your ancestors stood with Morgoth.

50
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,567
These Men stood with the Elves.

51
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,983
As a reward,
the Valar granted them this island,

52
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,067
which has changed much since then.

53
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,442
Do I detect a note of envy?

54
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,775
Not envy.

55
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,483
Sorrow.

56
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Once, Elves came and went
freely from these shores.

57
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,233
Our people were as kin.

58
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,942
Sharing gifts, knowledge.

59
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,650
What happened?

60
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,692
Númenor began to turn away our ships.

61
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,817
In time, they broke off all contact.

62
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,983
Why?

63
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,317
We may be about to find out.

64
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,567
Keep moving.

65
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,275
You would not want to be lost here
without an escort.

66
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,983
Put it with the others.

67
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:00,608
Too hot.

68
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,317
Patience. Patience.

69
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,858
We are men and women of Númenor.

70
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:41,442
I suggest we set history aside
for the moment and show some restraint.

71
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,942
Let's try not to antagonize these people.

72
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:47,358
Captain.
The Queen Regent is occupied.

73
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,983
As is Chancellor Pharazôn.
I suggest that you...

74
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,358
Kneel.

75
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,233
No one kneels in Númenor.

76
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,108
Sorry.

77
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,025
Speak, Elf.

78
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,942
Name thyself.

79
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,775
Galadriel of the Noldor.

80
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,317
Daughter of the Golden House of Finarfin.

81
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,442
Commander of the Northern Armies
of High King Gil-galad.

82
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:54,775
Halbrand.

83
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,483
Of the Southlands.

84
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,358
A Man and an Elf, together?

85
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,150
Circumstances arose that...

86
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,358
We are companions by chance.
Met on the open sea.

87
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,192
Your captain, here,
delivered us from certain death.

88
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:14,108
All we ask is that Númenor
continue his mercy

89
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,733
and grant us ship's passage
to Middle-earth.

90
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,358
It's been generations
since a ship of Númenor

91
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,317
was permitted to make such a journey
on an Elf's behalf.

92
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,817
It is because of the Elves
that you were given this island.

93
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,959
What?

94
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,650
Surely you can spare
a few planks and a rudder.

95
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,900
Our ancestors were not given anything.

96
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,067
They paid for this isle
with the blood of their kin.

97
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,400
What the Elf means...

98
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:46,942
Then if blood be the price of passage,
I will pay it.

99
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,442
But one way or another, I will depart.

100
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:52,858
I welcome you to try.

101
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,233
I have no need of your welcome.

102
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,733
And you are quickly
wearing out yours.

103
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:00,483
- Guards!
- My friends.

104
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:06,150
It seems to me that our leaving
presents some complications.

105
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:09,275
Perhaps it'd be better if we stayed...

106
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:13,067
- Stayed?
- Long enough, good Queen,

107
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,442
to give you and your advisors
adequate time to weigh our request.

108
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,067
A few days, perhaps?

109
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:29,942
Three days. And the Elf
is to be restricted to palace ground.

110
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,567
I will not be made a prisoner.

111
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,358
I would sooner knee-cap a stallion

112
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,608
than seek to imprison the mighty commander
of the Northern Armies.

113
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,317
So, you shall be Númenor's guest.

114
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,858
Captain...

115
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:53,317
My gratitude.

116
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,733
"Good Queen?"

117
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:07,275
The Southlands
will still be there in three days.

118
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,584
But will its people?

119
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,650
Look around you.
This is a paradise.

120
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,150
Ripe with opportunity.

121
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,442
You really expect me to leap with you
back into the furnace?

122
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,775
You leapt into the sea to save one life.

123
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,150
I seek to save many.

124
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,192
I have been searching for my peace
for longer than you know.

125
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:26,525
Please, for both our sakes,
let me keep it.

126
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,775
Perhaps some peace
would do you good as well.

127
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,775
But at the very least...

128
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,608
do try not to make any new enemies.

129
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,358
It would be wise
to resolve this matter swiftly.

130
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,608
She is but one Elf.

131
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,942
An avalanche can start with one stone.

132
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,775
We dare not invite your father's cloud
back overhead.

133
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,483
Tell me about this captain.

134
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,525
His name is Elendil.

135
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,108
Originally of a noble line,
now a Sea Guardsman with a son,

136
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:24,567
if memory serves,
set to follow him into the service.

137
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,150
Heave!

138
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,567
Together now!

139
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,817
Heave!

140
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,358
You'll have to haul a sheet faster
than that if you want a spot in my guard!

141
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,400
Come on, cadets!

142
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,108
Together now!

143
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,942
Isildur...

144
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,192
Isildur!

145
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,025
Isildur!

146
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:13,358
Any cadet who earns
their place in the Sea Guard

147
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,942
becomes more than just
Númenor's protector.

148
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,108
Not that one!

149
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,692
Imrahil!

150
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,150
Portside!
Haul it into portside!

151
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,150
Valandil!
Ontamo!

152
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,067
Help!
Pull!

153
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:39,817
Co-ordination, cadets!
Back to it!

154
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:53,650
There is no harsher master than the sea.

155
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:35,442
The sea is always right!

156
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,067
The sea is always right!

157
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:43,608
Poor Imrahil.

158
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:47,358
His father is like to toss him out
on the stones.

159
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,900
Blind luck Isil's not joining him.

160
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:51,775
Me?

161
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:55,108
Your mind was in the bleeding clouds
again all day. What is it?

162
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,400
Just eager to get out there.
That's all.

163
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,775
Nine more days.
Nine more days!

164
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,858
We pass the Sea Trial, in four years,
we'll make officers.

165
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:05,775
Ten more, we'll have our own command.

166
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
- Mmm. Eight more for me.
- Eighteen maybe.

167
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,108
Isildur! Your sister's here.

168
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,817
There you are.

169
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,442
Berek, my boy.

170
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,692
Look who put down
the sketchbook for once.

171
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,442
Aw, you didn't have to come
all this way just to see me.

172
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,900
- Isil, cantina?
- Nah, you go.

173
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:29,483
Come find us later.
Don't be like your brother.

174
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,525
Got your whole life to be an old maid.

175
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:32,608
Or to be young.

176
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:36,858
What are you doing here?
Where's Father?

177
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:47,567
The Faithful believe that
when the petals of the White Tree fall,

178
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,317
it is no idle thing,

179
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,942
but the very tears
of the Valar themselves.

180
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:59,275
A living reminder that their eyes

181
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:04,650
and their judgment are ever upon us.

182
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,358
Do you believe that?

183
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,983
In my experience,
it is unwise to live one's life

184
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,858
guessing after signs and portents.

185
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:25,108
"Elendil." An uncommon name.

186
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,858
From our western shores, is it not?

187
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,358
Mmm.
It originates there.

188
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,150
Pray tell, what does it mean?

189
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,067
One who loves the stars.

190
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,567
That is not its only translation, is it?

191
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,192
In the ancient tongue of the Eldar,

192
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,733
it can also mean "Elf-friend."

193
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:51,067
And are you?
An Elf-friend?

194
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:57,025
I'm a loyal servant of Númenor.

195
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:00,817
And yet, though Elves
have been unwelcome on our shore

196
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,858
since the reign of my grandfather's
great grandfather,

197
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:07,275
you chose to break
with that precedent. Why?

198
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,442
It was the sea that put her in my path.

199
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,942
And the sea is always right.

200
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,858
The sea cannot commit treason.

201
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,150
With respect, Queen Regent,

202
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:28,483
given the circumstances, I did only
what I believed to be most prudent.

203
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:33,233
If, Elendil, that is truly your wish,

204
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:39,192
then I shall have to ask you
to perform a service.

205
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:44,692
These passages
reach all the way to Hordern.

206
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,442
Possibly beyond.

207
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,025
This must be how they escaped
our detection.

208
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,525
And how they shield themselves
from sunlight.

209
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,358
They're searching for something.

210
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,567
Some sort of weapon, perhaps?

211
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,942
I do not know.

212
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,983
But they ransack village after village,

213
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,317
toiling nightly to find it
for their leader.

214
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:13,442
One the Orcs speak of with near-worship,

215
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,983
even reverence,
if Orcs were capable of such a thing.

216
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,983
It seems Morgoth has a successor.

217
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:21,817
"Adar."

218
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,483
Why would Orcs refer to their leader
by an Elvish word?

219
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,525
Sauron was said to have
many names in days of old.

220
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,275
Perhaps this is one of them.

221
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:34,983
There is more at work here
than we can yet see.

222
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,108
First opportunity either of you has

223
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,442
to get a glimpse above this trench,
you'll take it.

224
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:42,400
Locate the closest tree line,

225
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:45,400
and when the sun is at its strongest,
we will make our escape.

226
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,567
If even one of us makes it home,

227
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,400
we can return in force

228
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,317
and sweep the enemy from these lands

229
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,043
like salt from a table.

230
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:57,733
Sew those lips and dig, Elf!

231
00:22:58,317 --> 00:23:00,942
- These roots block our path.
- Then rip them out.

232
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:05,775
Rip the whole stinkin' tree down!

233
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:09,608
Felling a tree will slow our progress.
We shall go around.

234
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:13,275
Try it, Elf.
And I'll make a map of your back.

235
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,775
This tree sprang from the earth
long before you crawled

236
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,858
from whatever wretched place you grew.

237
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,233
It has earned its place in these lands.

238
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:32,858
Good, Elf.

239
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,900
Very good.

240
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,400
You showed strength.

241
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:46,692
You just earned your company
a water ration.

242
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,025
Don't be afraid.

243
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,608
Surely you thirst.

244
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,400
There...

245
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:30,858
Tree.

246
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:33,817
Húna hravan! Húna hravan!

247
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:36,552
I will cut it.

248
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,317
I will cut it down!

249
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,692
Ánin apsene...

250
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:35,567
You will inform Pharazôn
that she's escaped.

251
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,900
I informed him last time.

252
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,233
That was a dog.

253
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,733
Be wiser to steal the half-sail.

254
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:06,817
That skiff will hardly get you
out of the harbor.

255
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
I assure you it's an improvement
on my prior mode of passage.

256
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:12,442
Still.
Can't let you take it.

257
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,567
I'm afraid the Queen has charged me

258
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,150
with seeing to it that you cause
no further disturbance.

259
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:20,108
I believe she saw it as a punishment.

260
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,025
Then she and I have something
in common after all.

261
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,275
We both wish you'd never brought me here.

262
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,942
I will take my chances on the skiff.

263
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:33,275
That would leave me little choice,
but to shout for your minders.

264
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:37,025
Suppose the words never manage
to escape your throat?

265
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,817
Supposing they did,

266
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,858
you'd be back at the palace in chains,
even further from your destination.

267
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:50,608
Who is this mortal who speaks to me
as if he has the slightest idea who I am?

268
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:57,067
I have a daughter who runs fast,
and a son who runs blind.

269
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,567
Your eyes bear
a striking resemblance to both.

270
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,025
Where I run and how I run there
are none of your concern.

271
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:08,858
Anywhere is better than here,
where I'm hated by all who see me.

272
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:13,317
So call to your guards,
or get out of my way.

273
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:18,483
You're not hated by all, m'lady.

274
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,817
You speak Elvish?

275
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,983
Where I was raised,
many speak it.

276
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:28,317
It is still taught in our Hall of Lore.

277
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,900
Still carved on statues throughout
the city, if you look closely.

278
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:34,275
Your Hall of Lore, how far is that?

279
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:35,900
A quarter day's ride.

280
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,275
What is it you seek?

281
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:41,233
Did you say "ride"?

282
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:54,817
There is not another man on this isle
that knows this craft better than I.

283
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,608
I will shovel coal if need be,
I'll splinter wood,

284
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:01,192
I'll shape a sea anchor for you,
free of charge,

285
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:04,025
sturdier than anything you have ever seen.
How's that?

286
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,442
I'm here to start anew.

287
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,400
Lend me that chance.
Please.

288
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:15,400
And I won't forget it.

289
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,775
You've a stout heart, lad.

290
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:23,483
But until you've earned your guild crest,
you can't forge steel in Númenor.

291
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:31,067
That's him, isn't it?

292
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:34,358
The fellow who sailed in with the Elf?

293
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,983
It's you, isn't it?

294
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:39,567
Certainly appears that way.

295
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,317
- What are you called, again?
- Depends.

296
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:45,108
Depends on what?

297
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:47,900
How close we are.

298
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,608
And how close are you and the She-elf?

299
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,233
You're on a lucky streak, low man.

300
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,692
Free sail to our island, eating our food,

301
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:09,317
drinking our ale...

302
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,900
What will you take next?

303
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,900
Our lands?
Our trades?

304
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:16,608
Don't forget your women.

305
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,317
Look at the mouth on him.

306
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,775
Maybe he and the She-elf
aren't so close after all.

307
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:33,608
Wager she'd prefer someone
of better breeding.

308
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,900
You're right.
You're right.

309
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,733
Here I am.

310
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,483
I'm a guest on your island,

311
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,692
and I haven't shown you
the faintest bit of gratitude.

312
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,192
How 'bout this?

313
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,233
Next few rounds on me!

314
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:02,983
You're not so bad, low man.

315
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,567
Well, then, I best make my retreat,

316
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,483
while you've still
got a warm opinion of me.

317
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:13,150
Men, ladies, anon!

318
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,233
Hey, low man.

319
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,608
Really thought I wouldn't notice?

320
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,900
Well, I thought it was worth a try.

321
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,733
Take it.

322
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,150
I don't want any trouble.

323
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,108
Bit late for that, isn't it?

324
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,150
I believe it is.

325
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:13,733
Hmm.

326
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:19,942
Please. Don't do this.

327
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:25,525
Why not? Low man!

328
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,317
Go.

329
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,733
Call me Halbrand.

330
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,858
Over here.

331
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:24,525
We're looking for
any information you may have on this.

332
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,275
I will take a look.

333
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:45,400
You didn't say the Hall of Lore
was assembled by Elros himself.

334
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:48,817
It is rather remarkable.

335
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:50,858
Of course...

336
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,567
You knew Elros.

337
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,192
An uncommon spirit.

338
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:59,150
But I was always closer with his brother.

339
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:03,192
Remarkable.

340
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,775
Thank you for bringing me here.

341
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:08,025
Thank our last king.

342
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:12,858
It was because of him
this place wasn't torn down.

343
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,483
He was loyal to the Elves?

344
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,192
Is loyal.

345
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,525
We forced him from the throne for it.

346
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,983
They say he spends his days
in the tower now.

347
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,775
An exile in his own kingdom.

348
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:36,942
There.

349
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,483
What is this?

350
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:48,692
The account of a human spy
retrieved from an enemy dungeon.

351
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,317
He drew this.
To record the tower's location.

352
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,817
Wait a moment.
I must be blind.

353
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,775
This is no sigil.

354
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,900
It is a map of the Southlands.

355
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,858
It is as Halbrand said.

356
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,233
And the inscription?

357
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,483
It is the Black Speech.

358
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:27,067
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

359
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:32,358
A plan by which
to create a realm of their own,

360
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:38,275
where evil
would not only endure, but thrive.

361
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:42,442
A plan to be enacted
in the event of Morgoth's defeat...

362
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,108
By his successor.

363
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,733
Galadriel.

364
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,817
Matters are worse than I imagined.

365
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,317
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

366
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,192
If Sauron has indeed returned,

367
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:08,525
the Southlands are but the beginning.

368
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,275
Nobody goes off-trail.

369
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:09,900
And nobody walks alone.

370
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:10,983
That's right.

371
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,567
Nobody goes off-trail.

372
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,900
And nobody walks alone.

373
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:16,900
Nobody goes off-trail.

374
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,775
- Come on.
- And nobody walks alone.

375
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,775
Nobody goes off-trail.

376
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,733
And nobody walks alone.

377
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,900
Nobody goes off-trail.

378
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:28,025
And nobody walks alone.

379
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,650
Nobody goes off-trail.

380
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,192
And nobody walks alone.

381
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,567
Nobody goes off-trail.

382
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,400
- So it's not better.
- And nobody walks alone.

383
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,567
Nobody goes off-trail.

384
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,317
And nobody walks alone.

385
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,650
Nobody goes off-trail.

386
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,692
We can't carry the cart without you.

387
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,942
We're going to be left behind.

388
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:52,775
No Brandyfoot has ever been left behind.

389
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,817
You know, after I lost Rose,

390
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:10,942
felt like the wheels broke out
from under me.

391
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:17,567
And then I saw you in the grass.

392
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,817
Right in this clearing.

393
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:24,608
You were so beautiful that day.

394
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,775
And in an instant,

395
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:32,817
I knew I'd grow old with you, Marigold.

396
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:41,733
We'll make it to the Grove.

397
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,650
All of us?

398
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,358
All of us.

399
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:48,733
How?

400
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,608
I'll stay at the front of the caravan.

401
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:55,608
And we've got Nori.

402
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:59,900
No! Look, once that girl
puts her head to somethin',

403
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,317
nothin' can stop her.

404
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
You lay one paw on that book,

405
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:23,650
and old Sadoc will use your hide
to make his next batch of pages!

406
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:26,317
You got a better idea?
The migration's tomorrow.

407
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,108
If you want to help him find those stars,

408
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,108
our best hope is in that book.

409
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:31,817
I don't want to help him.

410
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:36,692
He's a giant with a brackish temper,
who sometimes murders fireflies.

411
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:38,192
That was an accident.

412
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:40,942
Now, I say the sensible thing to do
is top off his food,

413
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:44,192
point him to the nearest human village,
and "Fare thee well, stranger."

414
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,567
- That's not where he belongs.
- And where does he belong?

415
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,275
- That's what I'm trying to find out.
- Why's it your problem?

416
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,858
What sense is it sticking your neck out
for him any more than you already have?

417
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:56,876
There's head-sense, Poppy,
and there's heart-sense.

418
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,733
There's common sense and nonsense.

419
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:01,692
And if you're all out of the first,
then you can borrow some of mine.

420
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,275
Rather borrow some star charts
out of that book instead.

421
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:07,567
And you're gonna help me.
Or would you rather I let slip to Malva

422
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,900
it was you who put fireweed
in her toe cream?

423
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:13,233
- Hmm?
- I'll keep watch.

424
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:16,275
Go.

425
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,025
Aren't you supposed
to do your speech now, Mr. Burrows?

426
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:40,168
Certainly.
I just have to fetch it from my cart.

427
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:42,858
Oh, good idea. You do that.
Fetch it from your cart!

428
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:56,692
"Rested legs and full carts"?

429
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:58,858
No...

430
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:02,692
Mmm. No, no, no.

431
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:13,692
Ah-ha!

432
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,442
"Full carts and fuller bellies."

433
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,275
Mr. Burrows!

434
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:31,525
What is it now?

435
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:34,608
Oh, no, it's just, um,
everyone's waitin'.

436
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,442
Are you all right?

437
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,233
Yes, yes.
Almost done.

438
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:43,275
How much have you got left?

439
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,650
Just a little left?

440
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:48,275
Just tell them I'm almost ready.

441
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,400
Right. No! I mean left.
Yes. No, I...

442
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:53,733
I'll tell 'em right now, go straight now.

443
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:58,900
Calm yourself,
and get yourself some chestnut pie.

444
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:02,942
Strange girl, that one.

445
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:25,692
Most agreeable, honorable Harfoots.

446
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,942
Another season has passed in this glade,

447
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:37,942
leaving us with full carts
and fuller bellies.

448
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:40,650
Some fuller than most,
if we're being honest about it.

449
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,608
Uh, what else...

450
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:46,192
The Moon is very full,

451
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:49,233
so be careful where you're having
your shenanigans later on.

452
00:43:49,317 --> 00:43:51,733
It'll be in full view of the entire camp.

453
00:43:51,817 --> 00:43:53,275
And nobody wants that.

454
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:56,608
I'm only jokin' ya.

455
00:43:56,692 --> 00:44:00,275
And now, before we begin our next journey,

456
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,775
we remember those from prior migrations,

457
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:08,692
- who fell behind.
- Hear, hear.

458
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:12,525
And should any Harfoot
fall behind this migration,

459
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,025
they likewise will be carried with us

460
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:18,942
in our hearts and in our memories.

461
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:27,608
In life, we could not wait for them.

462
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,567
But here, now, we welcome to our circle...

463
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:44,942
Miles Brightapple.

464
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:50,525
Stuck in the snows of the mountain pass.

465
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:52,108
We wait for you.

466
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:58,108
Chance Proudfellow.

467
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:02,233
Yarrow Proudfellow.

468
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:07,400
Strap, Dewis,

469
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:10,983
Linseed Proudfellow.

470
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:15,483
Taken by landslide one rainy winter day.

471
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:17,733
We wait for you.

472
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:29,650
Daffodil Burrows.

473
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:32,775
Wolves.

474
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:35,275
We wait for you.

475
00:45:37,983 --> 00:45:41,650
Druda Bumbelly.
She ate the sunshine yellow berries.

476
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:42,817
We wait for you.

477
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,233
Blovo Bolgerbuck.

478
00:46:12,942 --> 00:46:14,025
Bees.

479
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,525
We all loved him, but he was an ijit.

480
00:46:20,525 --> 00:46:21,900
We wait for you.

481
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,442
Ma Hambley.
Was making a sculpture...

482
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,233
We wait for you.

483
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,108
Nori?

484
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,150
You have lied, stolen,

485
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:59,858
brought a dangerous outsider
into our midst.

486
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:01,067
And she lied.

487
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,317
- He already said that.
- Well, she did.

488
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,025
But, no, he was lost. Hurt.

489
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:08,692
What was I supposed to do?
Leave him there?

490
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:12,108
You must admit, Sadoc,
it's quite extraordinary.

491
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:16,067
Have you ever heard tell
of beings falling from the stars?

492
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,733
I've heard of beings
who were turned into stars.

493
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:21,400
Never the other way around.

494
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,650
It's very troubling.

495
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:25,608
But what about the stars on that page?

496
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:27,067
What's it say they mean?

497
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:31,275
Nothin'. The pages are all burnt up.
Why didn't you bother to read them?

498
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:33,067
I thought we'd have time later.

499
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,483
Who's "we"?

500
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:40,025
No one. Just me.
He's my friend.

501
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:41,983
We don't need friends, girl.

502
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:44,108
We need to survive.

503
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:46,983
Without friends,
what are we surviving for?

504
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:50,358
"Good little Harfoots,
stick to the path, flee every danger,"

505
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:52,942
heaven forbid we explore
something new for once!

506
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:54,733
Elanor Kellamark Brandyfoot!

507
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:58,275
Our way has kept us alive
a thousand years.

508
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:01,650
Our laws are clear.

509
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:07,483
Any Harfoot that breaks them
is to be decaravaned.

510
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:16,692
Our laws are clear, indeed.
But...

511
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,025
Miss Brandyfoot is young.

512
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,358
With as much hair still to grow
on her toes as sense between her ears.

513
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:31,525
Tomorrow we depart as planned.

514
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:36,650
And the Brandyfoot cart will be with us.

515
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:40,834
At the back of the caravan.

516
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:42,650
- At the back?
- At the back.

517
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:45,233
Wait, wait, wait a sun-sliver,
now, Sadoc.

518
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,233
We have to talk about this.

519
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,525
Now, you mean the back of the back,
or do you mean the middle of the back?

520
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:53,358
I mean the back.

521
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:58,150
You may as well have stamped our name
in the book of the left-behinds.

522
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:04,275
There's a reason he came to us.

523
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:06,483
Honestly, Nori.

524
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:09,817
Do you see a destiny in this?

525
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,567
Do you think the stars reached down
and touched ya, is that it?

526
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,567
Do you think you're special?
You're just a child.

527
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,733
I know I'm not special.

528
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:27,567
I know I'm just one little Harfoot
in a grand wide world.

529
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,817
But he is special.

530
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,067
I can feel it.

531
00:50:35,983 --> 00:50:37,567
My darlin' girl.

532
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,817
Ever has your heart been
like your father's.

533
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:46,192
But the tallest milkweed gets snipped.

534
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:49,483
It's time to pack.

535
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,900
Oh, no!

536
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,233
Oh!

537
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:10,117
- You will die, Queen!
- Oh, no!

538
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,942
- Oh, no! Galadriel!
- I smite you!

539
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:14,983
Oh, no!

540
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,275
Take that!

541
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:17,567
Galadriel?

542
00:51:18,192 --> 00:51:20,275
The Galadriel?
Scourge of the Orcs?

543
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:23,567
Never mind what she's the scourge of.
Why is she in Númenor?

544
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:27,525
Waiting for a ship to Middle-earth.

545
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:33,067
Queen Regent's raised me to Post Captain,
to keep account of her in the meantime.

546
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,442
You brought in an Elf,
so Míriel promoted you?

547
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,400
Who gets to escort her back?

548
00:51:37,483 --> 00:51:39,483
Looking for a promotion, cadet?

549
00:51:40,442 --> 00:51:41,983
Nine days until the Sea Trial.

550
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:43,427
- Tell him.
- You ready?

551
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:46,775
I'm afraid our northside relations
have taken the liberty

552
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:49,775
of inviting themselves over
for a feast to see you off.

553
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:53,067
- Trust that's all right?
- I was thinking I might defer.

554
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,858
- Defer?
- Just for a season, perhaps.

555
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,900
Did you know about this?

556
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:06,025
Well, I listen to him on occasion,
so, yes, I had my suspicions.

557
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:07,793
And you didn't bother
telling me about them?

558
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:10,317
- I'm only thinking about it.
- I was talking to Eärien.

559
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,900
I've been carrying a bit
on my shoulders lately, Father.

560
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:15,858
Is this really so tragic?
Anárion told me you deferred twice...

561
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:18,192
Anárion? What's your brother
have to do with this?

562
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:20,692
- Nothing.
- Well, slightly more than nothing.

563
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:23,108
Thanks.

564
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,650
Oh, good gods.

565
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:33,108
I'll tell you what I told him.

566
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:37,567
There is nothing for us
on our western shores.

567
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:40,608
The past is dead.

568
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:44,025
We either move forward or we die with it.

569
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,858
And do you think it was easy convincing
the sail-master you were up to the task?

570
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:52,108
I never asked you to do that.

571
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:54,692
Yes, you did when you got into a scrap
with the Queen's guards.

572
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:57,168
- They started that!
- Or got thrown out of your horse training.

573
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:58,400
That wasn't my fault!

574
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:00,001
Actually, Isil's right, that one wasn't...

575
00:53:00,025 --> 00:53:02,025
I wasn't talking to you!

576
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,525
- Pardon me, Captain.
- What?

577
00:53:06,942 --> 00:53:09,108
Message for your daughter, Eärien.

578
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:23,483
I know you've doubts, son.

579
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:30,483
But... But can you not trust that I have
ever your best interest at heart?

580
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:37,275
The watery part of this world has a way
of healing even the deepest of wounds.

581
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,983
The way it's healed yours?

582
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:50,192
In nine days' time, when the Sea Trial
begins and that ship launches,

583
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:51,775
you will be on it.

584
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:54,817
- Father.
- What is it?

585
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,317
I made apprentice.

586
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,400
I've been accepted to the Builder's Guild.

587
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:03,608
How? I thought the guild
never reconsidered.

588
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:05,858
Isildur convinced me to reapply.

589
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,358
Isildur convinced you?

590
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:27,817
How fares the quest for peace?

591
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,858
Better than expected.

592
00:54:30,942 --> 00:54:32,233
What happened?

593
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:34,775
Dispute about a woman.

594
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,692
Halbrand.

595
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:37,983
Don't start.

596
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,108
You do not belong on this island.

597
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:44,025
If there's one of us
that doesn't belong here, Elf, it's you.

598
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,108
I'm not so sure of that anymore.

599
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:48,775
But of one thing I am now certain.

600
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:52,608
You are more than you claim.

601
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,775
I found this in the Hall of Lore.

602
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,900
That's funny.
I found this on a dead man.

603
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:15,442
Thought the pattern suited me.

604
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:19,817
Many ages ago,

605
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:22,900
a man bearing that mark

606
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:26,692
united the scattered tribes
of the Southlands under one banner.

607
00:55:27,983 --> 00:55:30,900
The very banner that might
unite them again today.

608
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:34,400
Against the evil that now seeks
to claim their lands.

609
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,483
Your lands, Halbrand.

610
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:45,108
Your people have no king, for you are him.

611
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:51,275
That's an odd thing to say
to a man in a cage.

612
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,608
A cage you have landed in because
you chafe under the rags of the common.

613
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:59,650
And the armor that ought to rest
upon your shoulders

614
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,150
weighs upon your soul.

615
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,900
Be careful, Elf.

616
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:22,817
The heir to this mark
is heir to more than just nobility.

617
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:29,817
For it was his ancestor
who swore a blood oath to Morgoth.

618
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,817
I am not the hero you seek.

619
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:40,192
For it was my family that lost the war.

620
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:42,150
And it was mine who started it.

621
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,733
Ours was no chance meeting.

622
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:47,275
Not fate, nor destiny,

623
00:56:48,025 --> 00:56:50,358
nor any other words Men use
to speak of the forces

624
00:56:50,442 --> 00:56:52,442
they lack the conviction to name.

625
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,733
Ours was the work of something greater.

626
00:56:57,025 --> 00:56:58,275
You must see it.

627
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:01,108
All I see is an Elf
who won't put down her sword.

628
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,400
Come with me to Middle-earth.

629
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,358
And together we will redeem
both our bloodlines.

630
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:09,317
How?

631
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,067
You're stuck on this island.

632
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,942
And you're still short an army.

633
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,567
That is all about to change.

634
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:57,525
It is here, Father.

635
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:01,567
The moment we feared.

636
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:06,067
The Elf has arrived.

637
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,858
Off we go! Push!

638
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:46,067
Go on, Poppy, you'll fall behind.

639
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,983
Just give me a moment
to get my breath under me.

640
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,567
Back!

641
00:58:56,692 --> 00:58:58,358
Uh... Hey, hey...

642
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:16,150
Hey...

643
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:21,942
Friend.

644
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,817
This is it.

645
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:36,025
This is how we keep up
with the others, all of us.

646
00:59:37,692 --> 00:59:40,442
He helps us, and we help him.

647
00:59:42,275 --> 00:59:45,067
