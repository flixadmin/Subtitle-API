...nothing is more important than family.

Are you ready?

1778
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1779
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:20,800
...and don't you ever, ever...

1780
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,560
...interfere with my business again.

1781
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,640
Because if you do...

1782
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,060
...I'll kill you...

1783
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,820
...and everybody you love.

1784
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,900
I'll kill you dead.

1785
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,860
That's what I'll do to protect my family.

Hey.

- Yeah.

All right? Boundaries are good.

...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.

02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,130
Sometimes it leads to very little...

2210
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:49,630
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

2211
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:51,290
And you wonder...

2212
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:55,310
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

2213
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:01,010
How many more of these?

02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:21,300
