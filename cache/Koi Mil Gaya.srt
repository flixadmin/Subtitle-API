00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,487
The universe is made of
several groups of stars...

2
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,591
which are called the galaxies.

3
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,161
The galaxy our planet Earth belongs to

4
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,859
is called the Milky Way.

5
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,358
My husband, who was a space scientist
firmly believed...

6
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:21,270
that like the Milky Way, there
exist several other galaxies...

7
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:25,205
on which there could be life.

8
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,540
He had just one goal in life:
To discover life on other planets.

9
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,551
He had invented several types of
gadgets to collect data.

10
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:42,593
He used to send sound signals
into space...

11
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,764
and always said that a sound
is something that never dies.

12
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,790
That it reverberates in space forever.

13
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,669
He was sure that some day...

14
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,234
someone from another world would
listen to his sound signals...

15
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:00,611
and respond.

16
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:04,737
One evening...

17
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,913
Sonia!

18
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,390
Coming, dear. What happened?

19
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:28,291
Look! They're responding!

20
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,603
These sounds...?

21
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,267
I used the word "OM" to make a
pattern on this octopad.

22
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:43,105
I converted it digitally on the computer
to send sound bytes into space.

23
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:47,675
And look at this. Someone from
another world is responding to me.

24
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,086
I've succeeded in my research!

25
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,089
I've achieved a breakthrough, Sonia!

26
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:57,786
We must inform the
space centre immediately.

27
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:14,178
You see this Research Centre, Dr Mehra?

28
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,648
This is what we have been
researching for years...

29
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,278
and they contacted you of all the people?
How is that possible?

30
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,687
Why not? I too have spent a
lifetime doing this research.

31
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,491
I sent them various sound waves...

32
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,461
I invented so many sound
producing instruments

33
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,057
And after all my experiments,
when I sent the word "OM" to them...

34
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,560
in different variations and notes,
why isn't it possible that...

35
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,673
They say day-dreaming is a bad habit.

36
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,207
I must go home, to bed.

37
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:21,440
They don't realise that every discovery
or find is initially a dream.

38
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:28,085
Don't be disheartened.

39
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,055
People in the world always
reject new findings...

40
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,720
but accept them later.
That's what they're doing to us.

41
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,694
Is it possible for the worlds
in the universe...

42
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:47,471
separated by millions of miles...

43
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,474
to ever meet?- Why not?

44
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,105
Man has gone to the Moon. He has sent
space-shuttles to Mars and Jupiter.

45
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,574
Similarly, they must be trying
to find out about our world too.

46
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,709
Which is why UFO's
have often been sighted.

47
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:14,995
Why are the lights
going on and off?

48
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:20,163
What's happening?

49
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:30,071
Sanjay! Look there!

50
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,351
They didn't believe what I said.
But they've come!

51
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,218
No...

52
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,654
In a single moment, every dream
of our life was shattered.

53
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,098
The one who tried to
locate another world...

54
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,436
was lost to a world
no one knows about.

55
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:30,242
After his death, I had
no other support in Canada.

56
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:34,201
Rohit was very small,
so I came back home.

57
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:40,883
From what you say, I now understand
the whole case history.

58
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,256
These are the x-rays
of Rohit's brain.

59
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,695
See this white patch?
It's called the gliosys.

60
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,866
It's caused by an injury
to the brain.

61
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,701
But nothing of the sort
ever happened to Rohit, Doctor.

62
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,974
It did, Mrs Mehra, when you fell on
your stomach during the accident...

63
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,777
it caused an injury
to the baby's brain...

64
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:12,113
Who was in your womb and
this part of his brain was damaged.

65
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:18,846
That's why he doesn't have a normal
mental growth and is weak in studies.

66
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:24,053
Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's.

67
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,524
I'm afraid, even when he grows up,
his mental faculties will be stunted.

68
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:39,808
There surely would be a cure, doctor?
- There is. A brain surgery.

69
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:46,349
However... - What?

70
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,888
Chances of success in this case
are very bleak.

71
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,658
If the surgery fails, his whole
body could be paralyzed.

72
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,162
or it could even result in death.

73
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:03,793
No. I've already lost
everything I ever had.

74
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,201
I have nothing except Rohit.

75
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,434
I can't afford to lose him.

76
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,756
"Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's".

77
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,522
"Even when he grows up, his mental
faculties will be stunted".

78
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,655
Sorry, my foot! look at what you've
done to my house with that ball of yours.

79
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,998
I'm in the police force.
If you break another window pane...

80
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,098
I'll have you locked up.
Get that?

81
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:15,197
Argues with me.
Bloody crooks.

82
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:25,010
What harm have I done to you?
You've broken a window pane again!

83
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,384
I break your window pane.
But I do say sorry, don't I?

84
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:32,254
Are you doing me a favour?
How many years have I put up with you!

85
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:36,193
I'm not sparing you today. I'm not!

86
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,562
No one needs to be scared.
- Oh yes, let him come.

87
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:47,938
God! What have they done! They've
wrecked all the window panes!

88
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,735
The rain, the sunshine, the dust...

89
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,644
everything's in there, except me!

90
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't get angry uncle.

91
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,515
When I grow up, I'll mend
all your windows Uncle.

92
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,850
How much more do you want to grow up?
You're as tall as a tree already.

93
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:06,590
You want to be the Eiffel Tower?
- Don't insult our friend.

94
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,322
We'll replace all your window panes.
- Go ahead and do it!

95
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,532
Let's have five hundred bucks first.
- Five hundred bucks? What for?

96
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,469
We'll have to buy new ones, you see.
So let's have the money.

97
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,004
Rascals! You ask a
policeman for money?

98
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:25,576
Get going before I give
you a thrashing! Scram!

99
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:30,148
Rohit, hurry up son.
You'll be late for school

100
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,413
Today's a very important day, Lord.
I'm going to a higher class.

101
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,649
The seventh standard.
Take care of me, Lord.

102
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,263
Ma, have you never been to school?

103
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,865
We don't carry old books to a new class.

104
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:52,169
I'll be given new books
in the seventh standard.

105
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,139
You're not going to
the seventh standard.

106
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:59,301
Why not? All my friends are!

107
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:03,672
You've failed your grades.

108
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,352
I've failed again?

109
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:08,820
Yes.

110
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,457
I'm not going to school. Never!

111
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,861
That teacher's a nasty man.
I do all my studies, he still fails me.

112
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,793
And he promotes everyone else.
That's why I will not go to school.

113
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:30,364
Study harder this time, Rohit.
You will surely pass.

114
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,131
No.

115
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,446
There will be new students
in my class, Ma.

116
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,349
They'll tease me and make fun of me.

117
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,615
They'll call me a tall stick and
other things. I'm not going to school.

118
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,248
Throw those books away.
I don't want them.

119
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,996
It is not possible, Mrs Mehra.

120
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,466
Forget about promoting Rohit
to the seventh standard...

121
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,786
he shouldn't be in this school
in the first place.

122
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,106
There are special schools
for children like him.

123
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:06,543
There is no school like that
in this town.

124
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:11,481
But I'm trying to get
a transfer to Delhi...

125
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:16,820
where there are special schools
for children like Rohit.

126
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:21,053
The chairman of the bank I'm working
for has even promised me a transfer.

127
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:29,687
It's only a matter of a year, sir.

128
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,936
One last favour, sir.

129
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:37,174
Teachers never consider educating
children a favour.

130
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:42,773
But giving him a promotion like this
won't help him in any way.

131
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,245
Father, I know Rohit will never
become what I wanted him to be...

132
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:56,793
nor what his father wished for him.

133
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:59,991
But still, for the sake
of Rohit's happiness...

134
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:08,065
please, I request...

135
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,041
This is the last time.

136
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:22,482
If x is equal to 12,
and y is equal to 8...

137
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,846
what would x plus 3y be?
Hurry up and write down the answer.

138
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:45,500
How much would x plus 3y be?
Show me your answer.

139
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,160
This is the right answer.

140
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,427
Yours ought to be the first hand to
rise in the class next time.

141
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:42,722
"The sight of the birds... "

142
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,729
"awakens a desire"

143
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,208
"Although we tread the earth... "

144
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,413
"we will reach for the skies"

145
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:13,980
"Can you tell me how we will
fly so high, without any wings?"

146
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:19,991
"Anything is possible,
anything can happen... "

147
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:25,301
"we aren't so naive"

148
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:26,156
"You will see,
there will come a day... "

149
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:31,232
"a day like that
will surely come... "

150
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:41,910
"when everyone in the world
will want to shake hands with me"

151
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:17,775
"Happiness will embrace you"

152
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:22,916
"Life will change some day"

153
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:28,124
"The skies will bow
at your feet... "

154
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:33,287
"and there will be
no one like you around"

155
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:48,636
"The sight of the birds... "

156
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,483
"awakens a desire"

157
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,249
"Although we tread the earth... "

158
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,326
"we will reach for the skies"

159
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,159
"We will reach for the skies"

160
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,243
What are you shaking your head for?
You're all of six feet...

161
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,413
and you move around with these
two feet nothings. Aren't you ashamed?

162
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:59,215
Get out of our way.

163
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,752
We got here first,
so we'll cross first.

164
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,020
Get your bikes out of our way.

165
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,022
We do not believe in going in
the backward direction, moron.

166
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:09,255
We'll do the needful. You will always
keep moving in a backward direction!

167
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,432
He's begun to talk too much, Raj.

168
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:19,996
Rohit, these dogs are barking far too
much today. So let's give them a shot.

169
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:27,298
Oh yes, the formula... - 320!

170
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:38,588
Catch him.

171
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:28,297
Move... move.

172
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:55,125
May I ask, where you gentlemen
were going to, in such a hurry?

173
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:59,734
How dare you enter a no-entry zone?
- He knocked our bikes down, sir.

174
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,807
That doesn't mean you will
violate traffic rules.

175
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:06,376
Sukhwani, give them a ticket.

176
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:09,471
Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps you don't know who I am.

177
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,849
I know. You're Raj, the District
Magistrate Harbans Saxena's son.

178
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,855
Sukhwani, collect double the
fine from them. - Yes sir.

179
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,724
And have this news splashed
in the local newspapers.

180
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,126
People ought to know that when
Inspector Khan is in-charge...

181
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:30,095
no one can take things for granted.
Not even if he's Distt. Magistrate's son...

182
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:34,671
or the District Magistrate himself.
I hope you've got the message.

183
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,145
Colonel! Come on out!

184
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:46,880
Harbans! I have never seen
a moron like you!

185
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,818
Couldn't you even
come to receive me?

186
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:53,621
Malhotra, there can't be a bigger
idiot than you in the world!

187
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,858
You sent a fax that you were coming,
but you didn't tell me when and how!

188
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,498
Where would I have come
to receive you, you idiot?

189
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,558
Relax... must you welcome someone
with swear words like this?

190
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,635
But that's how this duffer is!
Look at him! He won't even embrace me.

191
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,808
My dear friend!
So nice to meet you.

192
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,549
Now that he has retired...

193
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,353
he has come to spend the rest of
his life with his friend.

194
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,088
And this friendship we will
celebrate for a whole year to come.

195
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:30,117
To begin with, we'll have a grand
party at our bungalow this evening.

196
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,532
At least come and sit down first.
- Come.

197
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:41,528
Well, well! I forgot to ask you
the most important question!

198
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:45,808
Where's our little doll...?
Our tiny little girl?

199
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,606
Your tiny little doll has grown up.
- Is it?

200
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:56,910
But where is she, Indu?

201
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,301
Why're you late?
- Not late at all.

202
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,010
The bus has yet to come...

203
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:23,646
and we'll have a blast watching
the three and half hour movie!

204
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:27,174
Three and a half hour movie?
- That's the fashion nowadays.

205
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,619
The bus has arrived!

206
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,717
Come quickly... we may miss the bus.
Come quickly.

207
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:42,721
The bus has left, we miss the movie
and our holiday's in ruins!

208
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:51,397
I've just arrived in the city.
Can you tell me where Shanti Villa is?

209
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,076
Shanti Villa? Over there...
- No, it's on this side!

210
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,414
But... - The jeep's going empty...

211
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,476
the girl's gullible,
she'll drop us at the movies.

212
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:10,018
Let's go. We'll take you there.

213
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:26,707
By the way, my name is Nisha
What's yours?

214
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,376
What places could one see here?
- Several.

215
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,590
How about the nightlife here?
What do folks do in the nights?

216
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:44,717
They sleep.

217
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:50,559
Are there no discos in town?
- There are. But kids aren't allowed.

218
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:52,394
Kids?

219
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:10,253
Hey! This is not Shanti Villa!
- This is a cinema hall.

220
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,451
But I... - You want to go Shanti Villa.

221
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,426
And we want go to the movie!

222
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,463
Shanti Villa's not far though,
Take a right, a left...

223
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:23,763
then right, left, left...
you'll reach Shanti Villa.

224
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,462
So you guys wanted a lift!
- Right, auntie!

225
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,938
You ought to be ashamed!
You fool people along with these kids?

226
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,539
And on top of that, you are laughing?
- I'm laughing at your nose.

227
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,548
When you scream, it twitches funnily!
Like a deflated balloon!

228
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,731
You shouldn't have done that, Rohit.

229
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,266
When someone asks for your help...

230
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,769
you must help him,
not make a fool out of him.

231
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,505
But I'd have missed the movie.

232
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:06,041
What did I read out to you
from the Gita?

233
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:11,276
God is forever willing to help those
who help others.

234
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:16,752
Didn't I read that out to you?
- You did. But I forgot.

235
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,991
The next time you meet that girl,
you're going to apologise to her.

236
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:29,662
You'll say sorry to her.
- I will.

237
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:36,574
What's this, Ma?
- It's a computer your Papa made.

238
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,310
Papa built a computer?

239
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:44,347
Through the computer and
the instruments he invented...

240
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:48,479
he spoke to people who live
far away, on the stars.

241
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:53,590
There are people on the stars?
- Yes.

242
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:09,638
I can't see anything, Ma.

243
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:13,404
There are several things
one cannot see.

244
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:21,411
But they do exist.

245
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,957
What? - Party!

246
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:38,400
Know what, Harbans?
Your jokes are still as hilarious.

247
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,638
Nothing has changed in all these years.
- Why not, daddy?

248
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,904
Look at Raj. He used to be a little
kid, but he's now as tall as a pole.

249
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,012
I'm sure someone pulled his legs!

250
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:54,916
She used to be small and fat too,
crying, "Mummy!" for everything.

251
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,320
You've met after years and
you've already started fighting?

252
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:07,059
Fights make the bond of
friendship stronger, Right?

253
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:32,054
One must eat on time
and sing praises of the Lord!

254
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:36,746
Give me more.

255
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,628
Their age to eat, all right.

256
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:43,133
So what's the spread like?
Where are the papad?

257
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:48,727
It's a queue. I'll come
in the line.

258
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:55,974
Is that mutton?
Give me some, I do eat it.

259
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,640
Give us some food.
- You just took a plateful!

260
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,786
That's gone down already.
- Where's down?

261
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,556
Here.
- God! Amazing tummy!

262
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,923
300 million people in the country
live under the poverty line.

263
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:12,796
They don't get to see
a fistful of foodgrains...

264
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,700
and you're taking a second helping?
- That's none of your business.

265
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,565
Right.

266
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,471
Give us some food.

267
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:24,840
Bittu! Give me some more!

268
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,467
Wait.

269
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,676
Oh my god! Escape from here.

270
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:33,338
Let the boys continue drinking,
I'm famished.

271
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,883
C'mon!

272
00:32:57,674 --> 00:33:01,974
Who does he think he is?
If I could get my hands on him!

273
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,176
I'm not going to spare him!

274
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,137
What are you upto?
What were you stealing?

275
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:03,006
No... I was only saying sorry.

276
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,276
Take a look.
That's his way of saying sorry.

277
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,978
By sticking chewing gum to the seat.

278
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:15,449
So you were sticking
chewing gum, were you?

279
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,754
He's was the one last night!

280
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,289
Jerk, you've started getting
too big for your boots?

281
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:24,351
You challenged us the day other
and you're now teasing girls?

282
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,463
He's the one who took me
to a cinema hall...

283
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,766
pretending to show me the house.
He even spilt food on my head!

284
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,919
That was nothing, Nisha. With what
he was doing today...

285
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:39,070
you'd have had to cut your hair!
Look at the chewing gum!

286
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,147
Such a rascal behind
that innocent face?

287
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,649
We ought to hand him over
to the police!

288
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:51,485
Oh no, why hand him over to the
police for something so trivial?

289
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:57,527
We'll let him go.
What say, Raj?

290
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:57,994
Scram.

291
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,996
Get lost.

292
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:12,403
Raj, why're allowing him to leave?
He should be taught a lesson.

293
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:36,887
Don't hit me! I'm telling you
the truth. I was only saying sorry.

294
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:55,438
Quite a champion with
your scooter, aren't you?

295
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,952
To be honest, that madcap
isn't at fault Nisha.

296
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:06,523
The sight of you could
drive anyone crazy.

297
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,326
Are you flirting with me?

298
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,628
Not at all. On rare occasions,
I speak the truth.

299
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,463
He won't get into mischief anymore.

300
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,523
He's been given a solid punishment.

301
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:34,373
But my son isn't like you,
because God hasn't made him like you.

302
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,114
He's a youth, no doubt.
But he has the brains of a child.

303
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,360
A naive, innocent child..

304
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:49,331
who can't tell the difference
between good and bad.

305
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,393
You boys beat him up mercilessly
and broke his scooter!

306
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,375
Because you thought he was
teasing this girl?

307
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,077
He came here not to tease you
or to harass you...

308
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,103
he came to apologise to you.
Look at this!

309
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:07,416
He wanted to say he was sorry.

310
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:12,856
Anyway, I can't hold this against you
because you are new to this town.

311
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,494
But Raj...?
He knows everything.

312
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,597
He used to be Rohit's class-fellow.

313
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,231
Because he's normal...

314
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:26,360
he moved ahead in life.
And my son remained where he was.

315
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:32,635
But you know something?
I don't regret it at all!

316
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,746
Because if normal people
are like what you are...

317
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:42,708
I'm glad my son is abnormal.

318
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:12,344
Rohit, what are you doing
in this computer class?

319
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,452
Rohit has also chosen computers
in his options, sir.

320
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:20,856
Go and take your seat.

321
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,259
I want to learn computers too, sir.

322
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,061
You need brains to learn computers.

323
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,965
And you're so bright,
you're still in the seventh.

324
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,737
My father was a great scientist, sir.
He even had a computer.

325
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,572
I want to become like my Papa, sir.
- So go and learn from your father.

326
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,478
He's no longer in this world, sir.

327
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,815
So go to the world he's in and learn.
And stop picking on my brains!

328
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,681
Go away. Out!

329
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,543
Avon cycle!

330
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,170
Ma...

331
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:55,277
Is this cycle for me, Ma?
- Yes, it's for you.

332
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,219
It's a very nice bicycle, Ma!
Avon! Thank you, Ma!

333
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:07,088
Say thank-you to her. She's the
one who brought it for you.

334
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:17,507
I'm not saying thank-you,
and I'm not saying sorry either.

335
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:21,735
I don't want the cycle.

336
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:27,411
Have you seen his anger?

337
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,032
It's true I've made a mistake.

338
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,561
But how was I to know that you
weren't upto any mischief...

339
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,907
and had come to say sorry to me?
Anyway, let bygones be bygones.

340
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,737
I'll say sorry to you now, okay?

341
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:08,550
And not just me... Raj, Monty and the
other boys will say sorry to you too.

342
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:15,164
And no one will
bother you ever again.

343
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,500
What if someone does bother me?

344
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,737
You and I will get together
and beat him up!

345
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,571
God! You too?
- Of course.

346
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,541
We're friends now, aren't we?
- Really?

347
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,009
C'mon!

348
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:43,615
All of you will now say
sorry to Rohit.

349
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,298
Didn't I tell you?
Are you happy now?

350
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,929
And listen everybody...
no fights ever again.

351
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:58,931
Only friendship.

352
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:05,036
Wait here, I'll be back in a minute.

353
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:17,081
No, I don't know to dance.
- There's nothing you've got to know.

354
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:21,164
Just hold my body like this
and sway to the music.

355
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,134
No, I feel scared.
- What are you scared of?

356
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,070
I'll teach you.
- No, I don't want to learn.

357
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,907
Hey! You're breaking into a sweat.

358
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:35,898
Oh yes, a bit of it.

359
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,123
It'll rid you of your fear
and you'll stop sweating.

360
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:52,353
But I'm all right.
- Have some.

361
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:56,489
It's not nice at all...
- It's very nice. Have it. Go on.

362
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,496
Then, let's dance together.

363
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,305
You're forcing him to have liquor?

364
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,367
what harm will some Bacardi do?
He's not a kid anymore.

365
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,610
I told you not to bother
Rohit anymore. But you guys...

366
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,282
Let's go, Rohit...

367
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,331
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose... "

368
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:09,630
"who knows where I'm going... "

369
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,110
"I'm sliding... "

370
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:23,108
"what have you done to me?"

371
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,998
"I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free... "

372
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,195
"who knows where I'm going... "

373
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,742
"I'm giving way... "

374
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:56,643
"I'm moving with you"

375
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,184
"What spell is this... "

376
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:45,527
"that we slip, as we walk?"

377
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:51,864
"We're having so much of fun,
things have changed so much"

378
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,262
"Why have things changed?"

379
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,099
"They have changed, all right"

380
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,103
"I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free... "

381
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,005
"who knows where I'm going... "

382
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,237
"I've begun to slide... "

383
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:34,478
"what have you done to me?"

384
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,231
"What's makes you so innocent?"

385
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,367
"It's because you're so sweet"

386
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:29,538
"And why do you find me so sweet?
Tell me"

387
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:35,974
"Why must I tell you?"

388
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:54,996
"Say something"

389
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,833
"What should I say?"

390
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,804
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose... "

391
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,806
"who knows where I'm going... "

392
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:07,936
"I've begun to slide... "

393
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:13,181
"I'm moving with you"

394
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:16,217
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose... "

395
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,255
"who knows where I'm going... "

396
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,349
"I'm slipping... "

397
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:34,601
"what have you done to me?"

398
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:39,271
"Over to you, I come"

399
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,617
Mr Sukhwani...

400
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:52,687
What is it...? Sister!

401
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:56,318
What madness is this?
- All thanks to your darling son!

402
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,161
I've got into the habit of
living with broken windows.

403
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,655
I got breeze, water and even
the sunshine inside my house.

404
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,199
But ever since I fixed these panes,
it's suffocating and hot in there.

405
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:12,570
But why must you break the panes?
Can't you just open the windows?

406
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:19,077
Why didn't it occur to me!
Thanks for the suggestion.

407
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,418
Shame on me! I must be the first
Sindhi to cause losses to himself!

408
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:26,478
Really?

409
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:29,324
She's now your girlfriend.
- How?

410
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,523
She presented you a bicycle?
- She even took you to the club?

411
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:34,963
Yes, she danced with me too.
- She dropped you home...

412
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,967
and said good night?
- Did she give you a good-night kiss?

413
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:39,594
No.

414
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,838
So how does she become his girlfriend?
- Why not?

415
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:47,876
They become boyfriend and girlfriend
only when they exchange kisses.

416
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,510
So what should he do?

417
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:54,108
My Mummy's absolutely right.
Men are real idiots.

418
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,318
They don't even know that they
must further their friendship...

419
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,449
before getting down to kisses.
- I want to meet your Mummy!

420
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:04,793
She thinks we men are idiots?
- Oh yes.

421
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,996
Know what, Rohit?
Give her a nice present.

422
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,266
Where do I have the money
to give her a present?

423
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,333
Ma gives me just a rupee every day.

424
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:18,804
But you can give Nisha a rose.
Can't you?

425
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,510
Didn't you tell me about a boy
whose mind is like a child's?

426
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,981
There was a nice article on the Net,
I've got a print-out.

427
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:35,490
It says, such people ought to be
given a lot of love and sympathy.

428
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:40,257
That is their only cure.

429
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,585
What are you up to?

430
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:07,711
Come on up here.

431
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:16,731
Why're you hiding the rose?
- I'm not.

432
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:21,324
It's a present for you.

433
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:30,379
Why're you blushing?

434
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:34,182
My friends say...

435
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,985
that when a girl and a boy
exchange kisses...

436
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,553
they become boyfriend
and girlfriend.

437
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:42,853
Your friends are right.
I am indeed your girlfriend.

438
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:48,095
Really? - Yes.

439
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,064
Nisha...
- Yes, Papa?

440
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:53,034
I must leave now.
- No, come on inside.

441
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,938
My Mummy and Papa will be
very happy to meet you.

442
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,608
Papa, Mama... this is Rohit.

443
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:05,099
Sit down, son.

444
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:09,150
Will you have something to
drink, Rohit? Tea, coffee...?

445
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,451
Bournvita.
- Bournvita?

446
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,157
Yes, Bournvita is a must
for strength and vigour.

447
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,360
Look at me. I'm in the seventh,
but I'm the tallest in my class.

448
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:23,657
Thanks to Bournvita.

449
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,603
Sorry, Rohit. We have no Bournvita.

450
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:28,865
No...?

451
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,440
But you must have Bournvita at home!
You must drink it every day.

452
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,467
Oh yes. We'll have some bought today.
- And we'll drink it too.

453
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:40,775
Call from District magistrate, sir.
- Tell him I'm coming.

454
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:48,510
Nisha, save the page, my child.
I'll be back soon.

455
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,202
You know computers?
- Yes.

456
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:06,007
I also know that you want
to learn to operate it.

457
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,242
Will you teach me?
- Of course.

458
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:13,746
So let's go to my house!
I have my Papa's computer.

459
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:25,960
These stars...?
- Yes!

460
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:29,864
My Papa was a big scientist.
He spoke to people living on the stars.

461
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,996
Really! - Yes indeed.

462
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:41,843
What's this?

463
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,545
I don't know.

464
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:49,351
Looks like one of
your Papa's projects.

465
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:54,911
Look, it says "press B"

466
00:54:58,193 --> 00:55:02,398
Nothing's happening.
- That says "B" too. See?

467
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:07,126
Let's connect them and see.

468
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,739
How did you play that?
- I know the tune. Ma taught me.

469
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:57,849
Want to hear it?

470
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:08,893
Rohit, teach me to play it.
- It's very easy. Give me your finger.

471
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,907
"My dreams, my imagination... "

472
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:07,949
"and my desires now have a face"

473
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:22,368
"My existence has
a reason... "

474
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:27,771
" now that I've found someone"

475
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,835
"Whom have you found?"

476
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:36,284
" I've found someone"

477
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:56,561
"You and I did always meet... "

478
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:12,855
"but why do I feel today... "

479
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:19,318
"that I've found someone?"

480
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,494
"Whom have you found?"

481
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:27,498
" I've found someone"

482
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:10,278
"What does meeting me do to you?
Tell me, will you?"

483
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,043
"Tell me, will you?"

484
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,380
"I'll tell you in your ear... "

485
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:28,788
"come closer, will you?"

486
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:33,360
" I know what you're
going to tell me"

487
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,233
"I'm not going to heed
your request to come closer"

488
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:41,034
"Listen to me... do listen!"

489
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:47,711
"You and I did always talk... "

490
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:52,653
"but why do I feel today... "

491
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:59,423
"that I've found someone?"

492
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,762
"Whom have you found?"

493
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:08,436
" I've found someone"

494
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:55,750
"When you are with me,
you're close to me... "

495
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:59,820
"you're close to me,
even when you leave"

496
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:15,163
"There can't be a realisation
like this one"

497
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,998
"I can't figure out
why all this happening... "

498
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,836
"I can't figure out
what's happening in my heart"

499
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:26,840
"You must, figure it out!"

500
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:33,250
"My heart did always beat... "

501
01:01:34,456 --> 01:01:38,159
"but why do I feel today... "

502
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:45,532
"that I've found someone?"

503
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:49,168
"Whom have you found?"

504
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:53,539
" I've found someone"

505
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:57,608
"My dreams, my imagination... "

506
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:02,567
"and my desires now have a face"

507
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:07,054
"but why do I feel today... "

508
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,891
"that I've found someone?"

509
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,556
"I've found someone"

510
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:29,233
Rohit, come quickly.
Dinner is served.

511
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:48,592
Kasauli Tigers are a strong side...

512
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:54,266
But the Blue Bulls are no easy team,
score is even at 50:50.

513
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:02,642
Gas has entered the final few minutes
with score at 60:58.

514
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:06,135
Blue Bulls passed the ball &
Kasauli Tigers have snatched it mid-way.

515
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,416
Kasauli Tiger's Raj Saxena is
moving forward swiftly...

516
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:13,474
.. Crosses the halftime with the ball.

517
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:18,893
You idiot!

518
01:03:20,028 --> 01:03:23,327
A beautiful girl walks
away with the boy.

519
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:26,701
Girl takes away the boy and players
take away the ball.

520
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:30,838
I'm confused over which game's
commentary should I give?

521
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,041
Anyway, Raj moves forward and
passes the ball..

522
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,210
But Blue Bulls snatch
the ballonce again...

523
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:39,481
The game has resumed again and the
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

524
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,382
And a basket from the Blue Bulls!

525
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:46,686
The scores are even, a few seconds to go
and the match is getting exciting...

526
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,356
The game has resumed again and
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

527
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:54,021
the supporters of both the side
are vociferously cheering their teams.

528
01:03:54,563 --> 01:04:02,869
And there's another basket
by Raj Saxena!

529
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:11,702
The winners of the Hero Cup
are the Kasauli Tigers!

530
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,950
What's happening here, Rohit?

531
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:53,045
I want to play basketball too.
I too want to become a champion.

532
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:57,504
People will clap for me then.

533
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:01,186
Like Nisha was clapping for me?

534
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,958
But how will you learn on your own?
Let us teach you.

535
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,996
Will you really teach me?
- Of course. We'll teach you.

536
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:36,987
You're not hurt, are you?
- No... it's okay. Go ahead.

537
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:48,998
I don't want to learn!
I don't want to!

538
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:02,847
How will you get any applause
unless you learn?

539
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:12,567
You dare take me on
over Nisha?

540
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:16,367
Watch your step in the future.
Understand?

541
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,090
Ma says those who sin
are always punished.

542
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,721
But I have committed no sin.
So why am I being punished?

543
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,564
Everybody pokes fun at me.

544
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:47,768
If You don't help me,
who will?

545
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:51,438
You have so much of strength.

546
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,442
Give me some of Your strength, Lord.

547
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,878
Please... give me some strength, Lord!

548
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:04,905
What are you up to...?!

549
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:09,502
What have you been doing!
- I did nothing.

550
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:14,546
It's happening on its own, Ma!
- You did nothing...? Nothing?

551
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:33,100
What's happening, Ma?

552
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:35,136
There's a power failure in the
whole of the city, sir.

553
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,404
It's pitch dark everywhere.

554
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:41,341
What's up with this torch, Sukhwani?

555
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:44,244
It doesn't work on electricity anyway.

556
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,943
Looks like there's going to be a storm.
A deadly storm.

557
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:31,782
Sir! Look!

558
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:36,622
God!

559
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:35,252
There's news of a UFO being sighted
in Kasauli, in Northern India.

560
01:11:35,957 --> 01:11:40,417
Several space organisations all over
the world refuse to believe this incident

561
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:44,354
Because no radar station in the world
nor satellites in space...

562
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:47,068
could detect any signals of the UFO.

563
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,435
But UFO legends abound,
like ghost stories.

564
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,238
Those who see them, believe them.
Those who don't, refuse to believe it.

565
01:11:55,778 --> 01:12:02,149
A similar UFO sighting was reported
in Bangalore in May, 2001.

566
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,286
There are claims of UFO sightings
not only in India...

567
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,921
but all over the world.

568
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:10,983
Although there is no strong evidence,
there are people who believe in them.

569
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:07,880
The burning grass and this crater
is evidence that the spacecraft...

570
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:13,449
that flew over Kasauli last night
landed right here.

571
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:20,027
Looks like this is where
the spacecraft landed.

572
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:22,195
This is amazing!

573
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:27,362
The aliens from another planet chose
our town over the rest of the world!

574
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:33,408
Imagine how popular and famous
our little hill station is going to be!

575
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,778
I announce a two-day official holiday
to celebrate this event!

576
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,333
What's all this?

577
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:03,570
There's a carnival at Mall Road.
People are dressed like aliens.

578
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:10,006
C'mon, Rohit. Wear something unusual.
- All right. I'll be back in a moment.

579
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:21,680
What are you doing? - I'm making
eyes and a mouth on this pitcher.

580
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:24,725
What for? - I'm going to dress up
like an alien...

581
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,895
and go to the carnival
with my friends.

582
01:14:28,896 --> 01:14:31,364
Like an alien...?

583
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:33,199
You're not going anywhere.

584
01:14:33,234 --> 01:14:35,403
Why not? All my friends
are going, Ma.

585
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:36,938
There's a difference between
the rest of them and you...

586
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,067
What difference?
- No arguments, I say!

587
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:46,608
You're not going. That's it.
- God! Let's go!

588
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:04,323
Extra terrestrials... aliens?

589
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,333
What are you saying, Mr Khan?

590
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:10,565
It's a fact that a spaceship
landed here, Harbans.

591
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:14,242
It could also be a fact that someone
emerged from the spaceship.

592
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,545
That's right, sir. That's exactly
what has happened.

593
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,346
I have inspected the whole region.

594
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:24,876
From the footprints, it appears as if
some aliens came out of the spaceship.

595
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,422
But... - But what?

596
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:34,417
One of them did not go back.
- What makes you say that?

597
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:40,100
There were footprints of some aliens
which led to the jungles...

598
01:15:40,101 --> 01:15:44,003
but the footprints of one of them
did not lead back to the spaceship.

599
01:15:44,305 --> 01:15:47,764
What if they are indeed the
footprints of an alien?

600
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:49,775
We'll capture it.

601
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,007
That will be a bigger achievement
that man landing on the Moon.

602
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,882
It'll unravel thousands of
secrets of the universe.

603
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,886
But what if the alien is dangerous?
- We'll simply shoot it.

604
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:04,449
Whatever it is, till this is
fully proved...

605
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,627
we must keep it to ourselves.

606
01:16:07,628 --> 01:16:09,262
The whole of the hill station is
in a festive mood...

607
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:14,355
it'll unnecessarily spread panic.

608
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,932
It's no use calling me!
Ma won't let me go! Go away, Bittu!

609
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:59,341
What are you whistling for?
Haven't I said, I can't come? Go away!

610
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:45,926
Know what, Rohit? There's an alien
in the forest.

611
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,762
What's an alien?

612
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:51,865
Those from other planets
are called aliens.

613
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,967
How are they to look at?
- I don't know.

614
01:17:55,002 --> 01:17:58,063
They could look like animals,
or even like us.

615
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,376
Could they even look like Bittu?
- Bittu?

616
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:06,904
Yes, a kid came from the forest last night.
I thought it was Bittu.

617
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:10,811
I smashed the pitcher and shouted at him.
He ran away into the forest.

618
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:14,546
And see...? The pitcher's been
put together.

619
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,791
It must've been another pitcher.
- No, this is the one.

620
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:22,088
I drew eyes and a mouth on it.
Take a look.

621
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,588
It wasn't that alien, was it?
- Let's go and check.

622
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:32,502
If it can put together a pitcher,
it can do anything. I'm feeling scared.

623
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:36,337
What's there to be scared of?
I'm with you. Come on, come.

624
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:14,341
Rohit, looks like it was really a kid.
- Yes. Let's go back. - Let's go.

625
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:28,212
Have you landed from up there?

626
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:37,726
That's where he seems
to have come from.

627
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,368
We must do something for him.

628
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:46,396
If the police catch him,
God knows what they will do.

629
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:51,077
And if he remains in the jungle,
the wild animals will eat him up.

630
01:20:53,414 --> 01:20:59,444
So what must we do?
- We'll have to hide him.

631
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:07,360
Will you go with us?

632
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:12,021
Will you be my friend?

633
01:22:36,203 --> 01:22:39,739
Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind.

634
01:22:39,774 --> 01:22:44,003
Good morning, sir.

635
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,346
Have this roll developed and printed.
- Okay.

636
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:49,115
Make it fast.

637
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:54,646
You've done an amazing job, sir!
This is a fantastic idea!

638
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:58,122
A policeman's job can't be trusted.
Hired today, fired tomorrow.

639
01:22:58,326 --> 01:23:01,262
Especially with an honest man like you,
anything is possible.

640
01:23:01,264 --> 01:23:04,164
What rubbish are you talking Sukhwani?
- I'm only praising you.

641
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:09,228
This is a terrific side-business.
As long as weddings are held...

642
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:14,137
you're going to do roaring business!
- Sukhwani! Do as you are told

643
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:24,182
This is Khan here, sir. i

644
01:23:24,217 --> 01:23:27,985
I've taken pictures of the footprints
as you asked me to.

645
01:23:28,188 --> 01:23:30,824
I'll soon have them sent to you.

646
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:34,818
Your opinion in this matter is
very important, sir.

647
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,788
What happened...? What's wrong?

648
01:24:34,823 --> 01:24:35,256
What?

649
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:41,628
What happened?

650
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:47,155
Rohit, open the door

651
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:51,331
I'm glad you're here.
- Why? Any problem?

652
01:24:51,538 --> 01:24:56,545
Yes, he was screaming away!

653
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,778
He must be hungry. o

654
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:03,282
There are so many things here.
He won't eat anything.

655
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:05,985
He must be eating something else..

656
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:11,045
What do you eat?

657
01:25:14,264 --> 01:25:14,889
Glass?

658
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:20,729
Wood?d

659
01:25:22,203 --> 01:25:24,671
The net? The ventilator?

660
01:25:24,706 --> 01:25:28,576
- No, Rohit He's trying
to say something else.

661
01:25:31,046 --> 01:25:36,082
The air...? The rays?t

662
01:25:36,086 --> 01:25:39,653
Sunlight? - Sunlight!a

663
01:25:39,655 --> 01:25:42,956
God! He speaks!

664
01:25:42,957 --> 01:25:45,391
He understands what we say!

665
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:49,453
Which means, apart from having those
powers, he's also very intelligent.

666
01:25:49,831 --> 01:25:53,032
Oh yes. But how's he
going to eat the sunlight?

667
01:25:53,034 --> 01:25:54,568
Sunlight isn't something
you eat, is it?

668
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:58,006
What we eat gives
our body its energy.

669
01:25:58,206 --> 01:26:04,403
Maybe they draw their energy
from sunlight.

670
01:26:13,389 --> 01:26:16,791
Rohit, look...

671
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:21,920
Hide quickly! Hurry!

672
01:26:25,201 --> 01:26:26,534
What are you doing here
so early in the day...?

673
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:29,270
Nothing at all, Ma.

674
01:26:29,305 --> 01:26:32,867
Nisha! When did you arrive?
- Right now, auntie.

675
01:26:33,076 --> 01:26:37,010
So join us for breakfast. Come on.
- Go ahead. We'll come in a while.

676
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:44,176
I'm getting late for the office.
Come quickly.

677
01:26:51,693 --> 01:26:56,689
Why's that jug of water here?
Bring it along when you come, okay?

678
01:27:00,237 --> 01:27:05,071
Don't come out.
We'll be back in a moment, okay?

679
01:27:05,106 --> 01:27:08,975
Bye, Nisha... Rohit, make sure
you finish your breakfast!

680
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:11,269
Wow!

681
01:27:22,559 --> 01:27:25,359
Found the ball, Bittu? - No.

682
01:27:25,362 --> 01:27:27,228
What a sixer. The ball's disappeared
outside the stadium!

683
01:27:27,229 --> 01:27:30,998
Not outside the stadium.
It's inside that outhouse. Look.

684
01:27:31,033 --> 01:27:35,967
Yes, come on. - Come on. e

685
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:43,301
Where's the ball?

686
01:27:48,284 --> 01:27:50,784
What are you guys doing here?
- There's someone in there!

687
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:54,414
A ghost! - A monkey!
- Our ball is in his hand.

688
01:27:57,592 --> 01:28:04,061
Why have you come out?
Didn't I tell you not to come out?

689
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:09,436
What ball? You've ruined everything!
Everybody's got to know!

690
01:28:11,306 --> 01:28:12,940
Who's that?

691
01:28:12,975 --> 01:28:17,537
First promise us that you will not
utter a word about this to anyone.

692
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:25,981
He's a friend of mine.
Like all of you are.

693
01:28:28,457 --> 01:28:31,586
He came in that spaceship.

694
01:28:31,926 --> 01:28:38,420
The spaceship has left,
but this poor chap got left behind.

695
01:29:23,378 --> 01:29:25,314
Magic! - That's magic! Magic!

696
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:28,748
"Magic... "r

697
01:29:28,751 --> 01:29:33,742
"Magic... "r

698
01:29:54,542 --> 01:30:04,009
"Magic... "t

699
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:34,912
"The earth and the skies... "
"the rose and the rosegardens... "

700
01:30:35,118 --> 01:30:40,051
"the hills and the winds
are meeting today"

701
01:30:40,253 --> 01:30:49,425
"This is magic... "

702
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:59,041
"sheer magic".

703
01:31:26,368 --> 01:31:28,766
"What spell is this?"d

704
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:31,273
"It's a new language of
love altogether"

705
01:31:31,308 --> 01:31:36,176
" No one despairs anymore"

706
01:31:45,954 --> 01:31:50,618
"We're silent... "
"so are you"

707
01:31:50,859 --> 01:31:54,817
"And yet, we say so much"

708
01:31:55,028 --> 01:32:00,331
"How did this wonder happen?"e

709
01:32:00,537 --> 01:32:08,944
"It's magic... "I

710
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:19,782
"sheer magic"

711
01:32:57,559 --> 01:33:00,026
"You are the one our eyes cherish... "

712
01:33:00,061 --> 01:33:02,528
"you are the one
who lives in our heart... "

713
01:33:02,532 --> 01:33:07,469
"we expect nothing from you in return"

714
01:33:22,085 --> 01:33:26,680
"That you have come to see us... "

715
01:33:26,956 --> 01:33:31,016
"we dream lovely dreams"

716
01:33:31,225 --> 01:33:36,320
"Promise to be a friend always"!

717
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:45,926
"It's magic... "

718
01:33:46,141 --> 01:33:55,811
"sheer magic"o

719
01:34:04,493 --> 01:34:06,127
Why're you guys laughing so much?

720
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:07,961
Some new spaceship joke on SMS?

721
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:11,764
The spaceship is old hat. We're laughing
at a new twist to the story!

722
01:34:12,634 --> 01:34:16,238
Will Nisha and Rohit's children
be normal or abnormal?

723
01:34:16,273 --> 01:34:17,569
Rohit and Nisha's children?

724
01:34:17,604 --> 01:34:21,042
As if you don't know. Nisha spends
all her time with Rohit.

725
01:34:22,711 --> 01:34:25,613
Raj, do something
while you have the time.

726
01:34:25,614 --> 01:34:31,639
Else, that madcap will make away
with your goodies.

727
01:34:36,192 --> 01:34:39,627
Harbans, any news on the alien?t

728
01:34:39,628 --> 01:34:44,157
No. Looks like Inspector Khan
was mistaken.

729
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:51,262
Else, we'd have had some
information on it by now.

730
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:54,710
I have good news for you.
- Good news? What good news?

731
01:34:54,711 --> 01:34:59,311
Your son has decided to get married.

732
01:34:59,314 --> 01:35:03,744
It's Nisha, Uncle. a

733
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:09,118
Hear this? Nisha and Raj
have approved each other!

734
01:35:09,324 --> 01:35:13,157
Really...? This is wonderful news!

735
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,997
What say, Indu?

736
01:35:16,998 --> 01:35:17,863
What happened?r

737
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:21,061
Do you guys know?
Nisha's getting married to Raj.

738
01:35:21,269 --> 01:35:25,466
How did you get to know?
- My parents were at the club last night.

739
01:35:25,671 --> 01:35:28,210
They're the ones who told me.
- But how's that possible?

740
01:35:28,211 --> 01:35:32,238
Nisha is Rohit's girlfriend.
Let's go and tell him. - C'mon.

741
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,084
Why did you lie?
When did I agree?

742
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:16,320
You didn't disagree either. And that's
what our parents want too.

743
01:36:16,324 --> 01:36:18,425
It isn't about our parents.
It's about telling lies.

744
01:36:18,426 --> 01:36:22,593
Where have I spoken a lie?o

745
01:36:22,628 --> 01:36:25,666
That we like each other doesn't mean
we get married, Raj.

746
01:36:25,667 --> 01:36:30,537
In any case, it's necessary to get to
know each other before getting married.

747
01:36:30,572 --> 01:36:34,771
As things stand today, we won't get
to know each other all our lives.

748
01:36:35,009 --> 01:36:38,469
What do you mean?
- Do you think I'm blind?

749
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,514
Can't I see you and Rohit
are having an affair?

750
01:36:41,516 --> 01:36:45,475
What did you say?
Rohit and I...? An affair?

751
01:36:48,757 --> 01:36:50,958
Even if we are having an affair,
what is it to you?

752
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,993
Whom I see is entirely my business.

753
01:36:52,994 --> 01:36:56,047
You have no right to interfere
in my personal life.

754
01:36:56,082 --> 01:36:59,100
Do you get that?
- You're insulting me for that fool?

755
01:36:59,167 --> 01:37:02,100
He is not a fool.

756
01:37:02,104 --> 01:37:04,436
Looks like you've got to
know him very well!

757
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,739
Yes. Very well.
Him... and you, too.

758
01:37:21,354 --> 01:37:25,657
What's going on over here...?e

759
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:30,252
What happened, Rohit?

760
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:34,834
Nisha's getting married, Ma.
With Raj.

761
01:37:34,869 --> 01:37:39,806
So why are you upset?
Every girl gets married some day.

762
01:37:40,009 --> 01:37:42,007
But Nisha's my girlfriend, Ma!y

763
01:37:42,042 --> 01:37:47,878
What...? Nisha...?
Your girlfriend? - Yes!

764
01:37:51,153 --> 01:37:56,113
Because she spoke lovingly to you,
does that make her your girlfriend?

765
01:37:56,324 --> 01:37:58,393
She herself told me that
she's my girlfriend!

766
01:37:58,394 --> 01:38:02,523
And that I'm her boyfriend.
- She mustn't have meant it.

767
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:08,569
Nisha is an educated
and sensible girl.

768
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:15,304
She can be your friend...
not a companion for life. - Why not?

769
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:27,417
Rohit, although you have grown up...
you're still a child.

770
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:32,752
You're not like boys of your age.
- Why not?

771
01:38:32,961 --> 01:38:34,560
Why am I not like the other boys?

772
01:38:34,595 --> 01:38:38,032
I haven't done anything wrong...
so why's Nisha also leaving me?

773
01:38:45,407 --> 01:38:49,140
Everything would have been fine...

774
01:38:49,145 --> 01:38:53,478
had only we not seen that spaceship.

775
01:38:53,481 --> 01:38:58,350
Your father would have been
alive today and you...

776
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:03,224
you wouldn't have been like this.

777
01:39:03,225 --> 01:39:08,355
A spaceship? Papa...?
What happened, Ma?

778
01:39:08,797 --> 01:39:13,591
We met with an accident.

779
01:39:59,945 --> 01:40:01,247
What are you doing here?!

780
01:40:01,282 --> 01:40:07,311
Get ready quickly.
I'll serve the breakfast.

781
01:40:11,157 --> 01:40:13,503
Stop smiling and go back
to the outhouse.

782
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:15,850
Don't come out again,
you'll get caught. Go!

783
01:40:37,917 --> 01:40:41,355
Ma! I can't see anything!

784
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:45,021
Wash your eyes...
you'll be able to see.

785
01:41:05,146 --> 01:41:07,546
Ma! I can see everything!

786
01:41:07,581 --> 01:41:11,311
You say you can't see anything and
then you say you can see everything!

787
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:16,925
Hurry up, son.
You'll be late for school.

788
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,024
Time for computer classes.

789
01:41:18,059 --> 01:41:21,551
You mustn't come, Rohit.
The teacher will again scold you.

790
01:41:21,764 --> 01:41:24,296
Why will he scold me now?
I'm already studying computers.

791
01:41:24,331 --> 01:41:27,333
Rohit, where are your glasses?
Have you forgotten them at home?

792
01:41:27,368 --> 01:41:30,770
No, I left it them home. This morning,
I could see everything clearly.

793
01:41:30,972 --> 01:41:34,375
Really? - Oh yes..

794
01:41:34,376 --> 01:41:40,841
In that case, read what Mr Chaturvedi
is writing on the blackboard.

795
01:41:49,725 --> 01:41:53,023
I want the answer to that, boys.

796
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:16,581
Who gave that answer?

797
01:42:16,582 --> 01:42:21,542
Rohit, you orally solved a problem
meant for the tenth standard?

798
01:42:23,993 --> 01:42:26,860
Come inside. m

799
01:42:26,895 --> 01:42:32,264
Was that guess-work, or was it...?
- Was that the right answer, sir?

800
01:42:32,698 --> 01:42:35,898
Absolutely right.
But how did you solve it?.

801
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:39,035
I don't know, sir.
It just came to me.

802
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:43,511
Rohit...? I can't believe it.
- Neither can I, sir.

803
01:42:43,711 --> 01:42:45,979
But this is a fact.
- Where is Rohit?

804
01:42:46,014 --> 01:42:49,448
How many times have I told you
that you can't learn computers.

805
01:42:49,818 --> 01:42:52,084
You'd rather learn carpentry
or masonry!

806
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:55,222
But you turn up every time and I have
to insult you and drive you out.

807
01:42:55,224 --> 01:42:59,782
Mr Mathur! Is that the way
you talk to your students?

808
01:43:00,029 --> 01:43:02,896
Father, this boy has zero I.Q.

809
01:43:02,898 --> 01:43:05,764
He needs a doctor, not a teacher..

810
01:43:05,799 --> 01:43:08,068
See for yourself. e

811
01:43:08,069 --> 01:43:11,869
Tell me: without opening
a particular file...

812
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:15,398
how will you copy data from Windows
drive "A" to any other drive?

813
01:43:16,645 --> 01:43:20,081
You are deliberately asking him a
difficult question to belittle him.

814
01:43:20,282 --> 01:43:22,314
To begin with, go to programs... g

815
01:43:22,318 --> 01:43:26,118
when the Windows Explorer has started,
right-click on the file.

816
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,523
And without releasing the button,
take the file to another drive...

817
01:43:28,558 --> 01:43:34,648
and release the button.
The file will be copied, sir.

818
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:41,368
Didn't you tell me to learn it
from my father, sir?

819
01:43:41,369 --> 01:43:45,035
I've learnt it from my Papa.

820
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:48,438
You are a teacher, who's responsible
for thousands of students, sir.

821
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,874
You ought to inspire them
to move ahead in life.

822
01:43:51,909 --> 01:43:55,109
Computer did not make man,
man made the computer.

823
01:43:55,314 --> 01:43:58,514
So what the brains can accomplish,
your computers never can, sir.

824
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,619
Do not ever consider anyone
to be small, sir.

825
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:05,492
Because what is small
will become big some day, sir.

826
01:44:17,869 --> 01:44:20,955
Did you notice the look
on Mr Mathur's face?

827
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:24,007
But what makes you suddenly
so smart, Rohit?

828
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:27,341
There is a hitch. You will
forget about us now, won't you?

829
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,801
You'll have grown up friends.
- Rubbish! That's not true.

830
01:44:31,836 --> 01:44:35,722
You are my friends and
will always remain my friends.

831
01:44:35,724 --> 01:44:39,890
Rohit, pass the ball.

832
01:44:39,895 --> 01:44:46,023
Whom are you asking? This idiot, who's
still feeding on his mother's milk?

833
01:44:46,398 --> 01:44:50,695
What are you staring at?

834
01:45:00,246 --> 01:45:04,378
Rohit! Look at the ball!

835
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:17,057
You think you've become too tough?
Go check him out.

836
01:45:22,436 --> 01:45:24,601
What a punch!s

837
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:29,399
You've even got the strength!

838
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,577
Goodness!e

839
01:45:34,115 --> 01:45:40,417
Muscles! Take a look!s

840
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:48,252
Don't stare... c'mon!

841
01:45:54,636 --> 01:45:56,470
Looks like you guys haven't
had your mother's milk.

842
01:45:56,471 --> 01:46:02,270
Make sure you have it next time.
We'll have a nice bout.

843
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,113
Why have you come here?

844
01:46:07,148 --> 01:46:10,449
Are you angry with me?
- Yes.

845
01:46:10,484 --> 01:46:12,984
Why?- Because you're
not my friend.

846
01:46:13,019 --> 01:46:15,655
You're going away with Raj.

847
01:46:15,657 --> 01:46:18,782
I'm not going with Raj. - No?

848
01:46:19,494 --> 01:46:23,292
I've turned him down.
- Great! I don't like him.

849
01:46:24,166 --> 01:46:27,621
I don't like him either.
- We share our likes, don't we?

850
01:46:29,003 --> 01:46:32,301
We share our likes and
understand each other too.

851
01:46:33,175 --> 01:46:36,976
Which is why I have come
to make you see reason.

852
01:46:37,011 --> 01:46:42,311
Every girl has to get married some day.
She has to settle down.

853
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:44,684
Oh yes, that is true.

854
01:46:44,685 --> 01:46:46,850
So tell me what kind of a boy
you would like.

855
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:49,856
I'll find him for you.
- You will find him for me?

856
01:46:49,858 --> 01:46:51,523
Yes. We share our likes, after all.

857
01:46:51,558 --> 01:46:53,693
You will like what I like.

858
01:46:53,694 --> 01:46:57,497
Okay then, which boys do you like?.

859
01:46:57,532 --> 01:47:00,698
There's Bunty, Bittu, Aslam...
several others too.

860
01:47:00,702 --> 01:47:04,001
They're kids. - But I'm a grown up.

861
01:47:04,206 --> 01:47:06,039
It'll be great fun!
We'll always be together.

862
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:09,709
We'll go out together and
drink Bournvita all the time!

863
01:47:09,744 --> 01:47:13,378
Marriage isn't just about
drinking Bournvita, Rohit.

864
01:47:13,413 --> 01:47:16,380
It's a huge responsibility.

865
01:47:16,385 --> 01:47:20,220
A responsibility of giving
his wife lots of love, isn't it?

866
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:23,854
One can't live on love alone, Rohit.

867
01:47:23,889 --> 01:47:29,193
Every girl seeks a companion
who's mentally and physically strong.

868
01:47:48,416 --> 01:47:50,747
Am I not physically strong?

869
01:47:50,782 --> 01:48:01,659
Yes you are. - A bit raw mentally?
But I'll ripen.

870
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,725
Just keep watching.

871
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:11,101
I threw an amazing punch!

872
01:48:11,105 --> 01:48:13,608
And Nisha...! She was
stunned with my attitude!

873
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:17,568
And that ball! One kick
and it kept flying and flying!

874
01:48:23,618 --> 01:48:27,077
You're the one who did
all this, isn't it?

875
01:48:40,801 --> 01:48:43,301
No, Ma. Don't be afraid!
This is Jadoo, he's a friend.

876
01:48:43,336 --> 01:48:46,304
Get away from there!

877
01:48:46,307 --> 01:48:47,807
How did this thing land here!

878
01:48:47,809 --> 01:48:51,108
Don't scream, Ma! Someone might
come here... listen to me, Ma!

879
01:48:51,311 --> 01:48:55,271
Hear me out at least...!
- Keep away from it!

880
01:48:55,484 --> 01:48:57,113
What is it?u

881
01:48:57,148 --> 01:48:59,484
He came in that spaceship
we saw recently.

882
01:48:59,519 --> 01:49:01,785
What? - I brought him
from the forest.

883
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,990
He has been with me ever since.
He's very nice, Ma.

884
01:49:03,992 --> 01:49:06,493
Very nice?
Are you out of your mind?

885
01:49:06,494 --> 01:49:08,659
He's not staying here another moment!

886
01:49:08,663 --> 01:49:09,959
I'm calling the police right now!

887
01:49:09,994 --> 01:49:14,456
Listen to me, Ma! - How dare you
hide that thing here!

888
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:16,336
He has done us so many favours and

889
01:49:16,337 --> 01:49:17,337
You'll turn him over to the police?

890
01:49:17,338 --> 01:49:20,341
Favours! What favours?
- Take a look at me, Ma! Listen to me!

891
01:49:20,376 --> 01:49:25,966
I'm not looking or
listening to anything!

892
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:29,479
Mrs Mehra? This is Father Rodericks.

893
01:49:29,514 --> 01:49:33,475
How have you managed this?
Rohit is a changed man.

894
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:38,148
The whole school is astonished
at his knowledge and intelligence.

895
01:49:41,195 --> 01:49:45,823
And we have decided to
promote Rohit to Class 10.

896
01:49:47,368 --> 01:49:51,334
Are you listening?

897
01:49:51,369 --> 01:49:53,871
What's the matter, Ma?
Who called?

898
01:49:53,875 --> 01:49:56,507
The Principal.

899
01:49:56,542 --> 01:50:00,675
They've promoted you
to Class 10, Rohit.

900
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:06,386
That's because they don't have a
higher class than the tenth, Ma!

901
01:50:06,387 --> 01:50:09,052
But how did all this...?

902
01:50:09,054 --> 01:50:11,472
It's a miracle Jadoo has worked, Ma.

903
01:50:11,507 --> 01:50:13,890
Look, I'm not the same Rohit anymore.

904
01:50:13,895 --> 01:50:16,526
Your glasses...?s

905
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:18,898
I can see everything now, Ma.
And I can understand too.

906
01:50:18,933 --> 01:50:24,695
I have become worldly wise.

907
01:51:27,801 --> 01:51:32,100
From the photographs Inspector Khan
sent us, it is proved...

908
01:51:32,304 --> 01:51:34,139
that they are the footprints
of an alien.

909
01:51:34,174 --> 01:51:36,940
We are here for further research.

910
01:51:36,975 --> 01:51:40,435
Which means your hunch
was right, Khan.

911
01:51:43,148 --> 01:51:47,780
Tell me something, doctor.
This creature from another planet...

912
01:51:48,155 --> 01:51:51,492
is it dangerous?o

913
01:51:51,493 --> 01:51:55,452
Had it been dangerous, it would
surely have done something by now.

914
01:51:55,831 --> 01:51:59,296
But we haven't received
any such reports.

915
01:51:59,331 --> 01:52:02,962
Couldn't the silence also mean
that it's dead?

916
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:06,628
Perhaps. But even its dead body
will be very precious to us, sir.

917
01:52:07,005 --> 01:52:10,943
To capture the alien dead or alive,
I'll have to comb the entire area, sir.

918
01:52:11,676 --> 01:52:16,804
I'll need extra forces for that.

919
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:22,483
Hey Jadoo, how do I look?

920
01:52:45,212 --> 01:52:48,667
Rohit! What's gotten into you?
- I don't talk to kids.

921
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:53,016
It isn't my age to play
children's games anymore.

922
01:52:53,051 --> 01:52:57,889
It's time for me to sing and dance.
Tell that to everyone.

923
01:52:57,924 --> 01:53:01,189
What? Rohit's turned a hero?
- Yes, didi

924
01:53:01,395 --> 01:53:05,023
And he says, it's time for him
to sing and dance.

925
01:53:23,417 --> 01:53:26,082
Rohit! What are you doing?
- Practice!

926
01:53:26,086 --> 01:53:31,213
Practice? - Yes, look at them.

927
01:53:31,926 --> 01:53:34,391
I'm a bit raw.
Trying to ripen.

928
01:53:34,426 --> 01:53:37,725
Or else, people will laugh at you.
- Me? Why will they laugh at me?

929
01:53:38,264 --> 01:53:40,065
Because you're my girlfriend.

930
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:45,568
If I'm raw, won't they laugh at you?

931
01:53:53,612 --> 01:53:57,032
You're participating in the contest?
- Yes.

932
01:53:57,067 --> 01:54:00,453
Listen carefully to what I say, Rohit...
- No.

933
01:54:00,454 --> 01:54:05,418
Instead, watch what
I'm going to show you.

934
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:35,655
Everyone's laughing at you, Rohit.
Let's go.

935
01:54:35,657 --> 01:54:39,993
No way! I'll give it another try.

936
01:54:39,994 --> 01:54:40,619
Move. n

937
01:54:46,331 --> 01:54:49,461
Rohit, this is no child's play.
C'mon.

938
01:54:50,838 --> 01:54:54,173
All right. I'm leaving!

939
01:54:54,175 --> 01:54:58,300
One more try. o

940
01:55:51,231 --> 01:55:54,688
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe... "

941
01:55:54,902 --> 01:55:58,030
"all that happens is part of the game"

942
01:56:12,753 --> 01:56:15,881
"Curtains drop, curtains rise... "t

943
01:56:16,091 --> 01:56:19,219
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

944
01:56:19,761 --> 01:56:22,887
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe... "

945
01:56:23,097 --> 01:56:26,396
"all that happens is
part of the game"

946
01:57:03,336 --> 01:57:10,265
"Why is the grass... "
"always greener on the other side?"

947
01:57:10,377 --> 01:57:17,511
"Why does one not appreciate... "
"what one has?"

948
01:57:18,152 --> 01:57:21,645
"The heart always
speaks the truth... "

949
01:57:21,854 --> 01:57:25,791
"but why does one
not hear what the heart says?"

950
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:30,963
"Does not hear, does not hear"

951
01:57:31,664 --> 01:57:34,131
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe... "

952
01:57:34,166 --> 01:57:37,797
"all that happens
is part of the game"

953
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:17,877
" Come... "

954
01:58:17,878 --> 01:58:19,711
"take a look... "

955
01:58:19,713 --> 01:58:23,012
"and give it a thought"

956
01:58:23,217 --> 01:58:25,015
"Think about it... "c

957
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:29,853
"and consider what I say"

958
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:34,393
"That which appears small,
isn't really small... "

959
01:58:34,395 --> 01:58:39,524
"there's something big about it"n

960
01:58:39,701 --> 01:58:42,999
"There is something big about it"

961
01:58:43,034 --> 01:58:46,297
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe... "

962
01:58:46,907 --> 01:58:50,204
"all that happens is part of the game"

963
01:59:04,759 --> 01:59:07,886
"Curtains drop, curtains rise... "

964
01:59:08,095 --> 01:59:11,262
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

965
01:59:11,265 --> 01:59:15,065
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe... "

966
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:18,896
"all that happens is
part of the game"

967
02:00:14,661 --> 02:00:19,963
Well? Ripened a bit, haven't I?
- You, I...

968
02:00:20,835 --> 02:00:24,960
all this...?

969
02:00:25,838 --> 02:00:32,137
This is only the beginning.
Just wait and watch.

970
02:00:52,532 --> 02:00:54,666
This isn't meant for kids..

971
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:58,003
If it bursts,
you run out of gas.

972
02:00:58,038 --> 02:01:01,541
We'll see who runs out of gas.
How about a match?

973
02:01:01,576 --> 02:01:04,978
All pepped up? - You'll know
after the match, sonny.

974
02:01:05,013 --> 02:01:08,381
Really? So let's have a match.
- What's the bet?

975
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:09,513
The Hero Cup!

976
02:01:09,548 --> 02:01:12,675
Alongwith the Cup, whoever wins,
gets a kiss from Nisha.

977
02:01:26,899 --> 02:01:28,734
The two of us are playing
a basketball match.

978
02:01:28,769 --> 02:01:31,904
You will kiss the one who wins.

979
02:01:31,905 --> 02:01:34,407
I'm not kissing Raj ever!

980
02:01:34,408 --> 02:01:37,376
You will kiss me, won't you?
- That is, if you win!

981
02:01:37,411 --> 02:01:40,413
There's a huge difference between
dance and basketball, Rohit.

982
02:01:40,414 --> 02:01:42,079
You can't win it on your own!

983
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:45,381
You've challenged him without a team
and invited trouble!

984
02:01:45,585 --> 02:01:49,422
Now you're going to lose and Raj
is going to give you a thrashing!

985
02:01:49,423 --> 02:01:51,256
Why? You guys are my team. o

986
02:01:51,259 --> 02:01:55,057
We? They're so tall,
and we're so short!

987
02:01:55,262 --> 02:01:57,262
We can't even manage a proper jump.

988
02:01:57,297 --> 02:01:57,729
Look here. r

989
02:02:01,835 --> 02:02:02,734
Wow!

990
02:02:08,274 --> 02:02:13,612
Today's match is a
strange one indeed.

991
02:02:13,613 --> 02:02:16,615
have been challenged by
Rohit Mehra's team.

992
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:22,085
His team is called the Pandavas.

993
02:02:23,289 --> 02:02:24,289
What do I see?e

994
02:02:24,291 --> 02:02:30,259
Is this the team of the Pandavas
or is it their children?

995
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:38,597
Don't move, okay?

996
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,817
There goes the referee's whistle
and the match begins.

997
02:02:51,818 --> 02:02:53,885
Ball has been tossed up.

998
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:57,253
Raj Saxena, taking advantage of his
height, tosses the ball to a team mate.

999
02:02:57,657 --> 02:03:00,820
The Kasauli Tigers pass the ball
to each other, across halfline...

1000
02:03:01,027 --> 02:03:04,690
here's another pass,
and another to Raj Saxena...

1001
02:03:04,896 --> 02:03:09,199
Raj Saxena advances, but Rohit Mehra,
takes the ball away from Raj Saxena...

1002
02:03:09,737 --> 02:03:10,869
maneouvres the ball
from between his legs...

1003
02:03:10,904 --> 02:03:15,204
advances towards the D, jumps up and...
it's a basket!

1004
02:03:21,681 --> 02:03:24,483
The match gets underway again
with the referee's whistle.

1005
02:03:24,518 --> 02:03:28,318
Monty passes the ball to Raj Saxena
who moves forward and this pass...

1006
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:30,856
but Rohit Mehra snatches
the ball midway and...

1007
02:03:30,891 --> 02:03:36,658
Moves forward, eavdes,
jumps and basket.

1008
02:03:38,865 --> 02:03:41,868
The excitement is mounting,
the applause is getting louder...

1009
02:03:41,903 --> 02:03:46,699
and the scoreboard ticks on. '

1010
02:03:46,704 --> 02:03:49,875
The match begins again. The ball
is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1011
02:03:49,877 --> 02:03:52,545
Raj Saxena gets hold
of the ball and...

1012
02:03:52,547 --> 02:03:56,277
Rohit Mehra knocks it out the danger area,
passes it to a team member...

1013
02:03:56,484 --> 02:03:59,318
he once again takes charge of the ball,
advances towards the basket...

1014
02:03:59,353 --> 02:04:03,015
he jumps up and this is
the third basket!

1015
02:04:11,798 --> 02:04:16,402
Let's surround Rohit.

1016
02:04:16,404 --> 02:04:18,672
The ball is with PCB and
the match begins.

1017
02:04:18,707 --> 02:04:20,338
The ball is with Kasuali Tigers.

1018
02:04:20,341 --> 02:04:23,243
and Rohit Mehra is surrounded by
members of the Kasauli Tigers.

1019
02:04:23,278 --> 02:04:26,645
Jumping over the little boy,
Raj Saxena moves forward...

1020
02:04:26,847 --> 02:04:28,579
and this is a basket!

1021
02:04:28,583 --> 02:04:30,515
This is the first scoring point
from the Kasauli Tigers...

1022
02:04:30,518 --> 02:04:33,318
much to the delight
of their supporters.

1023
02:04:33,353 --> 02:04:36,255
The little boys pass the ball
to one another...

1024
02:04:36,256 --> 02:04:38,592
but Rohit Mehra's still surrounded,
not being able to do much...

1025
02:04:38,627 --> 02:04:39,592
and the kids are utterly helpless.

1026
02:04:39,594 --> 02:04:43,050
The ball's now with Raj Saxena and...
that's a basket!

1027
02:04:44,097 --> 02:04:47,100
Raj Saxena and his team rejoice.
The children are disappointed.

1028
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:53,061
Rohit Mehra is still surrounded and
the ball's with Raj Saxena...

1029
02:04:53,271 --> 02:04:55,739
and what do I see...?
Rohit Mehra falls to the ground!

1030
02:04:55,774 --> 02:04:58,943
Whether he fell or was made to fall,
Raj Saxena takes advantage and...

1031
02:04:58,945 --> 02:05:00,880
that's a basket!

1032
02:05:00,881 --> 02:05:06,842
The children protest. They want a foul
called, but the referee's unmoved.

1033
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:10,622
The scores are now even.

1034
02:05:10,625 --> 02:05:15,425
The ball is now with the little boys,
with Rohit Mehra...

1035
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:19,190
he makes a pass which takes the ball
to another member of his team...

1036
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:20,798
who's trying to jump high... t

1037
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,533
surrounded by the tall
Kasauli Tigers players...

1038
02:05:22,568 --> 02:05:25,505
there's little the boys can do.
The ball is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1039
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:30,041
and here's another basket!o

1040
02:05:30,076 --> 02:05:34,274
Why aren't you guys jumping?
- We're trying, but we can't jump.

1041
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:40,615
The Kasauli Tigers are getting
more and more aggressive...

1042
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:44,381
and Raj Saxena moves forward
to score another basket!

1043
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:47,393
The score is increasing.

1044
02:05:47,395 --> 02:05:51,130
One basket after another...
and here's another!

1045
02:05:51,131 --> 02:05:55,728
Raj Saxena and his players now
seem to be toying with the kids.

1046
02:05:55,936 --> 02:05:58,637
The kids are all jumping around...

1047
02:05:58,672 --> 02:06:01,699
but Raj Saxena is scoring baskets
from where he stands!

1048
02:06:01,908 --> 02:06:05,309
It appears as if it isn't a match,
as if the Pandavas...

1049
02:06:05,512 --> 02:06:06,779
have been invited for
a practise session!

1050
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:12,213
Here's another basket!e

1051
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:18,817
That whistle signals the half-time.

1052
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,157
Jadoo... what's happening?
Why aren't we being able to jump?

1053
02:06:23,363 --> 02:06:24,329
Sunlight. t

1054
02:06:25,365 --> 02:06:25,829
Sunlight?p

1055
02:06:31,038 --> 02:06:33,337
Jadoo gets his energy from sunlight.

1056
02:06:33,372 --> 02:06:39,176
Unless he gets sunlight,
he can do nothing.

1057
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:42,381
You mean, if there is no sunlight,
Jadoo can do nothing?

1058
02:06:42,416 --> 02:06:46,550
So what are we going to do?

1059
02:06:46,554 --> 02:06:49,853
Lord Krishna, please do something..

1060
02:06:53,226 --> 02:06:57,527
With the referee's whistle, play in
the second half has begun again.

1061
02:06:57,731 --> 02:07:00,231
The ball's in the air, going once again
to a player of the Kasauli Tigers.

1062
02:07:00,234 --> 02:07:06,365
He moves forward, passes the ball
... once again comes into Raj Saxena.

1063
02:07:17,149 --> 02:07:20,381
Kasauli Tigers continue the game
without bothering about Rohit.

1064
02:07:20,586 --> 02:07:22,086
Children's team are making a sincere
effort to give them a competition.

1065
02:07:22,088 --> 02:07:25,113
But they're unable to manage
the tall Players.

1066
02:07:25,326 --> 02:07:27,192
Kasauli Tigers are surging
ahead in the game...

1067
02:07:27,193 --> 02:07:31,061
But Rohit snatches the ball mid-way and
passes it to young team mate.

1068
02:07:31,262 --> 02:07:36,896
This child flies into the air,
passes the ball to another boy...

1069
02:07:37,103 --> 02:07:39,688
One child flies high into the air
and grabs the ball...

1070
02:07:39,723 --> 02:07:42,166
.. Is this a twist in the match or
am I getting unwell?

1071
02:07:42,201 --> 02:07:44,609
Whatever happening here is amazing,
ladies & gentleman.

1072
02:07:44,612 --> 02:07:49,181
Spectators are stunned.

1073
02:07:49,182 --> 02:07:52,451
Jadoo... Didi... Jadoo!

1074
02:07:52,452 --> 02:07:54,720
Match resumes once again and
the ball us with Kasauli Tigers...

1075
02:07:54,755 --> 02:07:56,919
Raj Sexena is moving forward
with the ball...

1076
02:07:56,954 --> 02:08:00,188
Three Kids fly high into the air
and pass the ball...

1077
02:08:00,393 --> 02:08:05,454
...to Rohit Mehra who flies high
into the air and baskets it.

1078
02:08:12,104 --> 02:08:14,640
Blessed is the one who sings
glories of the Lord.

1079
02:08:14,675 --> 02:08:17,274
Praise the Lord!I

1080
02:08:17,309 --> 02:08:21,770
The spectators are ecstatic.
The match moves on.

1081
02:08:22,146 --> 02:08:24,817
The Kasauli Tigers move forward,
passing the ball to each other...

1082
02:08:24,818 --> 02:08:26,484
they are surrounding the opponents...

1083
02:08:26,487 --> 02:08:33,393
but this boy flies ahead, picks up the
ball & passes it to Rohit Mehra...

1084
02:08:33,594 --> 02:08:38,288
and Rohit Mehra scores another basket!

1085
02:08:39,467 --> 02:08:44,300
I'm not having to look down much,
I can see it happening right up here

1086
02:08:44,505 --> 02:08:48,634
The Kasauli Tigers are falling apart
and the children refuse to come down.

1087
02:08:48,842 --> 02:08:52,643
They're scoring the baskets
right up there in the air...

1088
02:08:52,979 --> 02:08:58,015
teasing the grown ups
all the way.

1089
02:08:58,018 --> 02:09:04,145
Match is getting existing. I couldn't
imagine this match would take this cause.

1090
02:09:14,201 --> 02:09:16,367
This match sure is
getting exciting.

1091
02:09:16,402 --> 02:09:22,238
Looks like the little kids are going
to wear out the Kasauli Tigers.

1092
02:09:22,877 --> 02:09:26,675
Raj Saxena is exhausted and the kids
help themselves to another basket

1093
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:29,914
They're no kids, they've turned
out to be everyone's fathers.

1094
02:09:29,916 --> 02:09:34,682
They're scoring at will and
the score is way ahead.

1095
02:09:35,887 --> 02:09:38,056
25 seconds to go and we must see
which team clinches the match.

1096
02:09:38,057 --> 02:09:41,226
The scores are 48 and 49 points.

1097
02:09:41,228 --> 02:09:44,958
Now we've to see which
teams wins the hero cup.

1098
02:09:46,699 --> 02:09:49,201
Match resumes and the ball is
once again with the Kasauli Tigers.

1099
02:09:49,202 --> 02:09:52,137
...They're holding the ball firmly &
pressing it cautiously to team-mates.

1100
02:09:52,172 --> 02:09:53,238
.. And appear determined... not
let the ball reach the opponent.

1101
02:09:53,273 --> 02:09:57,199
...Ball reaches Raj Saxena an
experienced player.

1102
02:09:57,411 --> 02:10:00,278
...Moving forward he throws
the ball into the basket.

1103
02:10:00,313 --> 02:10:03,146
...But Rohit Mehra once again
gets hold of the ball...

1104
02:10:03,149 --> 02:10:08,947
Spectators excitment is running high,
just 10 seconds move to the final whistle.

1105
02:10:15,029 --> 02:10:19,925
Final scores is 50:49.

1106
02:10:40,054 --> 02:10:43,750
I see the Kasauli Tigers,
dejected, heads hanging...

1107
02:10:44,122 --> 02:10:48,423
And the little are moving forward in
glory... to receive the Hero Cup.

1108
02:10:48,695 --> 02:10:52,095
Rohit is being presenting the with
Hero Cup. Give them a big hand.

1109
02:10:53,432 --> 02:10:55,949
Ladies & Gentleman little Pandavas
have won the Hero Cup...

1110
02:10:55,984 --> 02:10:58,466
There's another reward with the Cup.
The Hero Honda motorbike!

1111
02:11:02,743 --> 02:11:07,112
Not time for the kiss yet.
One more victory to achieve.

1112
02:11:07,113 --> 02:11:11,204
Get the Hero his Honda!

1113
02:11:12,550 --> 02:11:15,086
How did the kids start flying?

1114
02:11:15,121 --> 02:11:17,622
Something is surely fishy.

1115
02:11:17,625 --> 02:11:19,756
We must find out from the kids.

1116
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:22,693
What are you talking about, Harbans?
- It's true.

1117
02:11:22,695 --> 02:11:28,663
My son is the butt of jokes
among his friends.

1118
02:11:28,902 --> 02:11:31,136
And it's all happening
because of your daughter.

1119
02:11:31,137 --> 02:11:34,595
I understand that, Harbans. I did my best
to make Nisha see reason. But...

1120
02:11:36,976 --> 02:11:40,104
Are you telling me that if Nisha
decides to marry Rohit...

1121
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:45,440
you will give her hand in Rohit's,
despite knowing he's mad?

1122
02:11:46,654 --> 02:11:49,787
Just calling someone mad won't do!

1123
02:11:49,822 --> 02:11:52,824
The word "mad" doesn't make it clear
what kind of a madman someone is...

1124
02:11:52,826 --> 02:11:55,827
and what category of madnes
she belongs to

1125
02:11:55,862 --> 02:12:00,298
For example, schizophrenia is madness.
So are megalomania, obsession...

1126
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:04,800
psychopathy and mental imbalance.
And there's also plain madness itself

1127
02:12:05,005 --> 02:12:06,672
And madness has no limits.

1128
02:12:06,673 --> 02:12:08,506
Mad, idiot, crazy...
are names for the mad.

1129
02:12:08,509 --> 02:12:09,974
So are crack, cuckoo and dimwit.

1130
02:12:10,009 --> 02:12:13,969
There are people who the world thinks
are mad, but they aren't really mad.

1131
02:12:14,181 --> 02:12:17,637
And there are those whose madness is
not obvious, although they are mad!

1132
02:12:17,851 --> 02:12:22,419
In short, this is a small
summary on... madness!

1133
02:12:22,454 --> 02:12:26,988
Why have you stood up?
Please remain seated.

1134
02:12:32,865 --> 02:12:37,068
As I was saying, there are
several signs of madness.

1135
02:12:37,103 --> 02:12:41,708
To shake your legs in a state of
nervousness is also a sign of madness.

1136
02:12:41,743 --> 02:12:46,711
And you folks think I'm mad!

1137
02:12:46,713 --> 02:12:52,341
That's because I'm madly in love
with your daughter.

1138
02:13:32,592 --> 02:13:34,259
"It has indeed happened"

1139
02:13:34,261 --> 02:13:36,094
"Your touch has started it all"

1140
02:13:36,095 --> 02:13:38,762
"I'm slain"

1141
02:13:38,765 --> 02:13:42,065
"What have I done to myself
in a state of ecstasy?"

1142
02:14:05,125 --> 02:14:07,791
"Our pining... "

1143
02:14:07,795 --> 02:14:11,094
"brings about a cloudburst. "

1144
02:14:51,672 --> 02:14:54,970
"The touch was but an excuse... "

1145
02:14:55,375 --> 02:14:58,469
" I feel you all over"5

1146
02:15:03,682 --> 02:15:07,184
"Our love was meant to be eternal... "

1147
02:15:07,186 --> 02:15:13,655
"and today, I've told you"

1148
02:15:15,261 --> 02:15:22,326
"I admire you. I know you
for what you are today"

1149
02:15:22,536 --> 02:15:25,538
" You sure have turned out
to be a true lover"

1150
02:15:25,573 --> 02:15:27,504
"My secret...
- I had discovered".

1151
02:15:27,539 --> 02:15:30,269
"Your fair arms...
- Why're you grabbing?"

1152
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:33,000
"It sends a tremour through my heart"

1153
02:15:34,047 --> 02:15:35,012
"It's has indeed happened"

1154
02:15:35,047 --> 02:15:37,048
"Your touch has started it all"

1155
02:15:37,083 --> 02:15:40,175
"I'm slain"s

1156
02:15:40,554 --> 02:15:43,853
"What have I done to myself?"

1157
02:15:44,056 --> 02:15:50,859
"Our yearning... "a

1158
02:15:51,063 --> 02:15:58,197
"makes the cloud shower again".

1159
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:34,727
"I tried to prevent my heart... "e

1160
02:16:34,941 --> 02:16:38,399
"it could not be held back.
No, it couldn't"

1161
02:16:43,282 --> 02:16:50,586
"At what you did... "
"it went out to you"

1162
02:16:55,227 --> 02:17:02,101
"I wonder what I did and
what that did to you... "

1163
02:17:02,368 --> 02:17:04,837
"it brings a smile to our face"

1164
02:17:04,872 --> 02:17:07,271
"Through days... - And nights... "

1165
02:17:07,306 --> 02:17:09,475
"together... - We shall talk of love"

1166
02:17:09,476 --> 02:17:12,774
"We have reined in our love"

1167
02:17:13,813 --> 02:17:14,979
"It has indeed happened"

1168
02:17:14,981 --> 02:17:17,816
"Your touch has started it all"

1169
02:17:17,851 --> 02:17:20,117
"Our pining... "

1170
02:17:20,152 --> 02:17:23,609
"brings about a cloudburst"

1171
02:17:24,657 --> 02:17:26,490
"It has indeed happened"

1172
02:17:26,493 --> 02:17:27,658
"Your touch has started it all"

1173
02:17:27,661 --> 02:17:30,788
"I'm slain"

1174
02:17:31,329 --> 02:17:34,630
"What have I done to myself
in a state of esctacy?"

1175
02:17:34,834 --> 02:17:38,291
"The cloud showers love again"

1176
02:18:01,527 --> 02:18:04,826
Why've you stopped? You were jumping
around so much the other day.

1177
02:18:05,363 --> 02:18:10,101
Jump over us again.

1178
02:18:10,102 --> 02:18:13,718
What are you looking down at?
What's in that bag?

1179
02:18:13,753 --> 02:18:17,334
Run! There's no sunlight!
Jadoo needs to be saved!

1180
02:19:42,461 --> 02:19:48,259
Sir, I've seen it with my own eyes.

1181
02:21:02,541 --> 02:21:07,166
Check what's in the bag.

1182
02:21:22,895 --> 02:21:26,862
Come and take a look.

1183
02:23:15,842 --> 02:23:21,969
Go... go home.

1184
02:23:22,681 --> 02:23:27,808
But how did you escape, Jadoo?

1185
02:23:36,029 --> 02:23:39,155
It was a narrow escape!
- You were amazing, I say.

1186
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:46,669
What happened?

1187
02:23:46,704 --> 02:23:51,833
Is Jadoo here, Ma?
- Yes, he's inside.

1188
02:23:54,047 --> 02:23:57,414
Rohit... what happened?.

1189
02:23:57,449 --> 02:24:00,550
The way Inspector Khan
was looking at me...

1190
02:24:00,585 --> 02:24:03,720
I'm sure he suspects me.

1191
02:24:03,722 --> 02:24:05,556
We'll have to hide Jadoo
somewhere else.

1192
02:24:05,558 --> 02:24:09,559
Let's hide him in my house.
My parents are away.

1193
02:24:09,561 --> 02:24:12,859
No, my house should be right.
No one will ever imagine...

1194
02:24:13,065 --> 02:24:15,467
that Jadoo could be in District
magistrate's friend's house.

1195
02:24:15,502 --> 02:24:17,934
For how long will you keep
hiding him like this?

1196
02:24:17,936 --> 02:24:21,320
He's bound to be discovered some day.
- No.

1197
02:24:21,355 --> 02:24:24,704
I'll take Jadoo away
to some other town.

1198
02:24:25,577 --> 02:24:27,878
Once the police start
looking for him...

1199
02:24:27,913 --> 02:24:31,713
you won't be able to hide Jadoo
anywhere in the world.

1200
02:24:32,084 --> 02:24:35,286
So what are we to do, Ma?h

1201
02:24:35,288 --> 02:24:38,881
There's only one way of
saving his life, Rohit.

1202
02:24:40,959 --> 02:24:46,727
Send him back to where
he has come from.

1203
02:24:46,933 --> 02:24:50,059
No, Ma! No one can
separate Jadoo from me.

1204
02:24:51,102 --> 02:24:54,272
As long as I live, no one can
even touch him.

1205
02:24:54,307 --> 02:24:58,574
Rohit, auntie is right.

1206
02:24:59,779 --> 02:25:05,905
You can't take on the world
on your own.

1207
02:25:06,452 --> 02:25:09,579
Jadoo will not go. e

1208
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:22,092
Everyone's going to feel sad
at the parting, Jadoo.

1209
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:26,601
But it's in your interests to return.

1210
02:25:27,806 --> 02:25:33,609
If Jadoo goes...
all powers will also go away.

1211
02:25:39,818 --> 02:25:44,113
What does that mean?n

1212
02:25:45,558 --> 02:25:46,824
It means... a

1213
02:25:46,826 --> 02:25:53,288
all the powers that he has given me
will go away with him.

1214
02:26:15,188 --> 02:26:18,339
Don't worry about me, Jadoo.

1215
02:26:18,374 --> 02:26:21,490
I'll live the way I used to.

1216
02:26:28,701 --> 02:26:36,163
Go, Rohit. Before it's too late.

1217
02:26:43,949 --> 02:26:48,847
We're going to miss you, Jadoo.

1218
02:26:58,565 --> 02:27:02,549
What's the matter, Rohit?

1219
02:27:02,584 --> 02:27:06,533
There's no response, Ma.

1220
02:27:10,243 --> 02:27:13,870
We know, the alien from another planet
is with you.

1221
02:27:16,915 --> 02:27:22,384
Hand it over to us.

1222
02:27:25,423 --> 02:27:31,722
We have surrounded your house
from all sides.

1223
02:27:32,097 --> 02:27:36,558
Till the count of ten, if you do not
turn it over to us...

1224
02:27:37,102 --> 02:27:43,070
we'll launch an attack on your house.

1225
02:27:43,774 --> 02:27:44,743
One.

1226
02:27:47,447 --> 02:27:48,572
Two. f

1227
02:27:49,449 --> 02:27:52,618
Jadoo, do something!

1228
02:27:52,653 --> 02:27:53,744
Sunlight. s

1229
02:27:53,952 --> 02:27:55,250
Three. w

1230
02:27:58,690 --> 02:27:59,916
Four. d

1231
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:08,095
They're responding, Ma!

1232
02:28:08,634 --> 02:28:09,431
Five.

1233
02:28:13,137 --> 02:28:13,934
Six. h

1234
02:29:24,209 --> 02:29:28,166
Rohit!

1235
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:32,683
Rohit, hand it over to us.
- Never!

1236
02:29:32,884 --> 02:29:36,513
Do not compel us! Else, we'll have
to use force against you.

1237
02:29:38,055 --> 02:29:41,684
Do anything you want to!
I'm not handing him over to you!

1238
02:29:41,893 --> 02:29:46,189
Snatch it from him!.

1239
02:29:58,242 --> 02:30:02,869
Leave my son alone!

1240
02:30:07,085 --> 02:30:07,881
Leave him. o

1241
02:31:51,756 --> 02:31:57,724
Khan speaking.
We shall be there very soon.

1242
02:31:58,996 --> 02:32:03,594
I will not let Jadoo go.
I will not, let Jadoo go.

1243
02:32:06,537 --> 02:32:09,040
Ma, where's Jadoo?

1244
02:32:09,041 --> 02:32:11,293
They've taken him away.

1245
02:32:11,328 --> 02:32:13,545
Where to? - I'll tell you.

1246
02:32:13,546 --> 02:32:14,840
Yes, me. i

1247
02:32:15,881 --> 02:32:19,384
I have never seen so much
love for a friend.

1248
02:32:19,385 --> 02:32:23,054
They're taking your friend to Delhi,
and from there to America.

1249
02:32:23,055 --> 02:32:29,688
Rohit, this is the time
to repay Jadoo's favours.

1250
02:32:29,894 --> 02:32:37,198
Go, save him and prove it that humanity
still exists in the world.

1251
02:32:37,970 --> 02:32:39,436
Go Rohit. h

1252
02:35:08,554 --> 02:35:13,349
Hurry up! Follow him!

1253
02:35:26,072 --> 02:35:29,073
You people?n

1254
02:35:29,108 --> 02:35:29,870
Jadoo?c

1255
02:35:36,082 --> 02:35:40,376
Go fast, man. C

1256
02:35:43,088 --> 02:35:43,713
C'mon!

1257
02:36:10,615 --> 02:36:13,451
You? Where's Rohit?

1258
02:36:13,452 --> 02:36:16,751
You won't find him.

1259
02:38:26,317 --> 02:38:30,379
Go, Jadoo.
They're waiting for you.

1260
02:38:57,448 --> 02:39:00,416
Thank you. h

1261

"Rohit Mehra in police custody"p

1262
02:40:37,881 --> 02:40:43,510
"Special Court to deliver verdict
on Rohit Mehra's fate today"

1263
02:40:47,059 --> 02:40:51,189
This is Zee news correspondent
reporting from Kasauli...

1264
02:40:51,397 --> 02:40:54,524
where the special court yesterday
acquitted Rohit Mehra...

1265
02:40:54,733 --> 02:40:57,902
on the grounds that
he is mentally abnormal...

1266
02:40:57,903 --> 02:41:02,202
and today, the citizens of Kasauli
are felicitating Rohit Mehra...

1267
02:41:02,573 --> 02:41:06,031
for setting a rare example
of humanity and friendship...

1268
02:41:06,244 --> 02:41:11,840
in helping an alien, whom he considered
his friend, go back to his own world.

1269
02:41:12,082 --> 02:41:15,210
Let's all felicitate Rohit Mehra.

1270
02:41:34,103 --> 02:41:37,233
See, auntie? Rohit said
he'd make it big some day.

1271
02:41:37,442 --> 02:41:42,406
And he's become such a big man today.

1272
02:42:10,139 --> 02:42:14,109
I know what you're thinking about.

1273
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:18,814
Jadoo has taken away the powers
he had given you.

1274
02:42:18,816 --> 02:42:24,113
Not my love.

1275
02:42:26,558 --> 02:42:30,327
You had become one hell of a hero.

1276
02:42:30,362 --> 02:42:31,827
What're you looking at?

1277
02:42:31,829 --> 02:42:35,287
He's gone, because of whom
you had changed.

1278
02:42:35,501 --> 02:42:40,796
Now kick the ball and show.

1279
02:42:41,171 --> 02:42:42,298
Let's go.

1280
02:42:44,674 --> 02:42:47,804
Yes, yes, take him and make him
wear your bangles.

1281
02:43:03,728 --> 02:43:08,531
Rohit, look! The ball is
flying in the air!

1282
02:43:08,566 --> 02:43:13,001
I can't see.

1283
02:43:19,876 --> 02:43:25,009
Now I can see clearly!

1284
02:43:25,215 --> 02:43:29,720
Looks like Jadoo has given
your powers back to you.

1285
02:43:29,755 --> 02:43:33,845
Look there...

1286
02:43:38,296 --> 02:43:43,492
Thank you, Jadoo.

1287
02:43:44,492 --> 02:43:54,492
