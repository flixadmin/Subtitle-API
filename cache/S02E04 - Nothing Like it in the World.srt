1
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,560
Federal authorities
have initiated

2
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,145
a manhunt for William Butcher.

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,980
It's Vought.
It's a fucking coup

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,481
from the inside.

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,983
I know who killed Raynor.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,525
Something to do with
the Supe terrorist

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,569
smuggled into Jersey.

8
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,821
Her brother.

9
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,657
I just want me wife back.

10
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,409
Bring Langley
the terrorist and you'll have her.

11
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,621
I was told he would
never know about Ryan or me.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,248
That was the deal.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,791
You need to make him leave.

14
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,668
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,919
and I'm gonna run.

16
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,005
Superheroes are not born,
but made,

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,673
via Compound V.

18
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,508
We got a Supe terrorist
below deck

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,553
and shit could go sideways
just like...

20
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,394
Ah, fucking diabolical!

21
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,068
I said he was mine.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,653
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

23
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,030
Our newest hero,

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,115
Stormfront,
stopped the terrorist

25
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,658
before he could take
more innocent lives.

26
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,455
Communication is everything.

27
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,165
Steve and I had been
dating for two years

28
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,167
when he asked me to marry him.

29
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,752
At the rehearsal dinner,
my dad said

30
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,588
we should look into
a 529 account for our kids.

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,715
Steve laughed
and said that was nuts

32
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,342
and that we were
never having kids.

33
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,178
Which was, um, news to me.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,806
Yeah. Long story short, um,

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,933
the caterer was totally cool
with everything,

36
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,061
but the Marriott did keep
our deposit on the banquet room.

37
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,021
So... Yeah.

38
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,481
Communication.

39
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,670
Details are still emerging
about the Supe terrorist

40
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,880
whose senseless attack
on an apartment building

41
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:14,176
left 59 people dead
and over 100 injured.

42
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,303
His name? Kenji Miyashiro,

43
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,722
a Japanese expatriate
living in the Philippines.

44
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,725
Miyashiro was radicalized
by the extremist group

45
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,769
Shining Light Liberation Army.

46
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,479
Witnesses who caught a glimpse
of the killer

47
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,399
described him as dead-eyed
and unemotional

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,402
as he rampaged through
the apartment building...

49
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,405
It wasn't your fault.

50
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,241
Many of the 59 victims
have not yet been identified...

51
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,160
Kimiko, look at me.

52
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,787
To notify their families.

53
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,706
Look at me.

54
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,165
Investigators have
so far not disclosed

55
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,667
further details
about the attack,

56
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,377
but officials have announced

57
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,422
they will hold a press
conference later this week.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,758
I-I didn't mean to.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,093
I'm sorry. I was just...

60
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,311
No one can debate

61
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,937
that New Yorkers owe their lives

62
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,148
to the brave actions
taken by Stormfront.

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,358
Earlier today,
Stormfront made an appearance

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
at a New York City park.

65
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,404
How many
more people have to die?

66
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,115
You guys, I have been shouting

67
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,867
up and down
the hallways at Vought,

68
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,911
and you know what they're doing
to stop another attack?

69
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,204
Jack.

70
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,956
Let's show Vought
what they have to do.

71
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,208
Tomorrow morning, Vought Square.

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,587
Be your own hero.
Make your voice heard.

73
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,965
I am counting on you
to show us the way.

74
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,675
Don't let me down.

75
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,527
There you are.

76
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,622
I was beginning to worry.

77
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,797
I've missed you...

78
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,634
so much.

79
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,471
Are you thirsty?

80
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,157
My good boy.

81
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,772
I ever tell you about
my recurring dream?

82
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,027
I'm on stage, alone,
at Carnegie Hall.

83
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,863
The audience is made up
of every poor bastard

84
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,991
who got killed
by the superheroes.

85
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,826
What are they doing?

86
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,206
Nothing. They're all
just watching me.

87
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,459
Waiting for me to do something.

88
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,757
We hit a dead end on Raynor.

89
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,133
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,801
Christ, I don't want
to hear sorry.

91
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,636
Sorry's not an option.

92
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,473
We can't have anonymous
skull-exploding assassins

93
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,099
walking around.

94
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,726
What if they hit
the speaker next?

95
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,770
Or the president?

96
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,238
Liberty?

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,865
You mentioned her before.

98
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,117
Second-tier Supe,
active in the '70s.

99
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,536
She was all over
Susan's private server.

100
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,997
Get Marvin to talk
to this Liberty.

101
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,125
Address on the back.
North Carolina.

102
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,961
All right.

103
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,089
We'll see what we can find.

104
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,966
Wait.

105
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,808
I found Becca.

106
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,603
Or, at least,
our best guess where she is.

107
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,980
Vought facility,
armed to the teeth.

108
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,607
Won't be easy.

109
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,069
We had a deal.
I didn't come through.

110
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,154
Jesus, Butcher,
I'm just giving it to you.

111
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,537
It's my fault you stopped
searching for her.

112
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,789
I put a target
on Homelander's back

113
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,416
and pointed you right at him.

114
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,336
I didn't know Becca was still...

115
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,299
It'd be good to have
one less person

116
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,552
in that audience staring at me.

117
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,485
Hey!

118
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,029
See?

119
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,116
You get disrespected
over and over and over,

120
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,576
that's what happens.

121
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,412
I mean, how much shit
is he supposed to take?

122
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,039
Everybody respects you.

123
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,419
Fucking terrorist was my save,
not hers.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,045
It was mine.

125
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,843
What? Now that-that media whore
i-is the face of The Seven?

126
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,053
- No, she's not. No, you are.
- Come on.

127
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,514
And it's not just her,
it-it's the entire team.

128
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,932
- No.
- Yes, it is.

129
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,477
It-It's a whole chain
of weak links.

130
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,191
I-It's very hard
not to take it personally.

131
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,067
Oh, I know.

132
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,778
I know.

133
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,034
I'll tell you one thing.

134
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,704
- You wouldn't put up with this shit.
- Mm-mm.

135
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,582
One little raise of the eyebrow,
and you would've knocked them

136
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,584
- all back in line.
- Yeah.

137
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,587
God, I miss that about you.

138
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,007
You don't need me to do that.

139
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,594
The Seven is your team.

140
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,931
You nurtured them,
you watered and fed them.

141
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,557
- That's... I did.
- Yes,

142
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,394
and if they can't
respect that or you,

143
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,523
well, it may be time
to tear out the weeds

144
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,026
and start all over again.

145
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,539
Change back. Change back!

146
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm sorry! I can only hold
a shape for so long

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,086
before it really hurts.

148
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,382
Change the fuck back now,
Doppelganger!

149
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,098
Yeah, it's okay. Come here.

150
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,350
It's all good.

151
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,894
Oh, my little boy. Come on.

152
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,897
Okay.

153
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,941
It's okay.

154
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,322
I love you.

155
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,034
I love you.

156
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:40,038
You're the most powerful man
in the whole wide world.

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,293
And there's nothing
that you cannot do.

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,135
Storming an
off-the-books Vought compound alone?

159
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,513
Butcher, how is it possible that
you're dumber than you look?

160
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,474
- Mate, it's Becca.
- No shit.

161
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,685
But win or lose,
you ain't coming back.

162
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,894
Course I am.

163
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,064
That's bullshit.

164
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,066
Look, it's not like Vought's

165
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,027
gonna let us settle down
in Orlando.

166
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,820
We got to get gone
and stay gone.

167
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,822
What about us? Hmm?

168
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,866
We're the Spice Girls, right?

169
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,954
You're in charge now.

170
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,456
Mazel tov.

171
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,292
Motherfucker,
I don't want to be in charge.

172
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,794
Matter of fact,
I don't even want to be here.

173
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,463
I gave up my family for this.

174
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,089
For you.

175
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,507
When do I get them back?

176
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,052
You find this Liberty slag.

177
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,429
See what you can rumble.

178
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,514
You jump through a few hoops
for the colonel,

179
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,683
and she'll help you
the same way she helped me.

180
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,353
She always liked
you more, anyway.

181
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,607
And what about Frenchie?

182
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,485
He's been high as kite for days.

183
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,529
- He won't even notice I'm gone.
- Hmm.

184
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,989
And Hughie?

185
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,203
Kid's a weeper.

186
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't want him to get snot
all over me jacket.

187
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,544
Hey, Homelander.

188
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,317
Maeve begged me

189
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,737
to spare your life.

190
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,907
So I gave you a second chance,

191
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,120
and... you failed me.

192
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,790
What are you talking about?

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
No more lies.

194
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,427
You go ahead and scream.

195
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,472
As much as you want.

196
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,059
What... what did I do?

197
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,728
I told you
to kill Hugh Campbell,

198
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,146
and you hesitated.

199
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,857
I-I said that we should
go to the police.

200
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,236
You disobeyed my orders
because you're with him.

201
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,074
Fuck you.

202
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,662
Hughie Campbell broke
my fucking heart.

203
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,082
Worse than anyone ever has.

204
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,503
And part of me wants to blast
his fucking face off,

205
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,715
so no, I'm not "with him."

206
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:23,553
But if you want to kill me
because I'm not a murderer

207
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,515
and I won't
straight-up execute someone,

208
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,558
then go ahead.

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,853
So, tell me,

210
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,106
am I lying?

211
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,365
You're not lying.

212
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,007
Ooh.

213
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,719
Black Noir. Hi.

214
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,888
Would you like an Almond Joy?

215
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:28,326
Um, do you mean William Butcher?

216
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,415
Okay.

217
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,589
Well, he was definitely
on the yacht with the terrorist.

218
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
Some of his known accomplices
were, too.

219
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,136
We lost him
in these storm tunnels.

220
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,471
So, yeah.

221
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,765
There you go.

222
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,726
I'll keep you posted
when we find them.

223
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,065
Or I can look right now.

224
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,402
Just, uh, run
a facial recognition search.

225
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,158
Or you can join me.

226
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,376
Hey.

227
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,962
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

228
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:25,050
- Oh, you're so bruised.
- Oh, no, it's fine. It's okay.

229
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,301
That was all me?

230
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,511
It's cool. Really.

231
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,972
I mean, you know,
chicks dig bruises.

232
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,515
You know, I was in...
When I was in fifth grade,

233
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,309
I took a tetherball to the face.

234
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,894
And Amy Burtenshaw,
she brought me

235
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,104
Jell-O Pudding Pops
for, like, two weeks.

236
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,648
I'm talking way too much.

237
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,109
I could've killed you.

238
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,113
But you didn't.

239
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,325
Um...

240
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,996
I got your voice mail.

241
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,832
Oh, God. Can... Oh, God.

242
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,293
Can we just chalk that up
to a-a drunk dial?

243
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,421
I-I'm okay, really,
it's just, uh...

244
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,006
Do you just mind, you mind

245
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,925
- if we just don't talk about it?
- Okay.

246
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,344
So, we got the Compound V
out there,

247
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,720
and Vought is still kicking,

248
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,515
so we risked our lives

249
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,435
just to make the world
way worse.

250
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,271
Yeah, but no, no, no.
That's not true.

251
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,149
I mean, you know,
these things, they...

252
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
Look, Annie, they take time.

253
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,987
How much time?

254
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,617
Just...

255
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,413
Sorry, just give me one second.

256
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,457
Um... Hey, M.M.

257
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,963
Raleigh? Like, the one
in North Carolina?

258
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,341
Yeah, okay, okay.
Jesus, I was just asking.

259
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,011
Um, yeah. Yeah.

260
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,139
Um, just pick me up

261
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,183
at, like, 81st
and-and Central Park West.

262
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,687
Okay, okay, all right.

263
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,898
Um, I have to go.

264
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,191
What's going on?

265
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,861
Can I call you later?

266
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,914
Are you just gonna...

267
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,666
hang out?

268
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,376
Here?

269
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,044
Yeah, I...

270
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,047
I just... I can't go back
to the Tower right now.

271
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,341
Why? What happened?

272
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,844
I can't...

273
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,472
I can't do this anymore.

274
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,566
Are you fucking insane?

275
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,110
She can't come with us,
Hughie. She's chipped.

276
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,821
So, I have a second cousin
who lives around there.

277
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,741
I could tell Vought
that I'm going to visit.

278
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,035
And we'd be out of
the city, away from the cameras.

279
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,244
I mean, no one would see us.

280
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,540
No. Even her standing here
is dangerous.

281
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,626
Maybe he's right. I...

282
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,461
This is a bad idea.

283
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,550
If we're gonna go knock
on some Supe's door,

284
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,594
don't you think it makes
a little bit of sense

285
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,056
for us to have one of our own?

286
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,808
Look, she's in rough shape.

287
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,310
She needs this.

288
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,148
You mean you need this?

289
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,201
Hey. How you doing? Cool.

290
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,994
What's up, man?

291
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,465
Oh, fuck!

292
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,467
Don't bullshit me,

293
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,929
- Ashley.
- Shockwave is just here to talk about Vought for Tots.

294
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,180
I swear to God.

295
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,349
What the fuck is
Vought for Tots?

296
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,476
It's a new fitness outreach
for toddlers.

297
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,144
Apparently,
they're getting obese.

298
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,189
Well, shit, I fucking love
fat kids. Use me.

299
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,608
Oh, good, you're here.

300
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,235
You tell him yet?

301
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,737
Tell me what?

302
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,282
I thought we were gonna have
a strategy meeting.

303
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,449
A-Train, you're out.

304
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,701
Out of what?

305
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,494
Out of The Seven.

306
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,289
You did great, but we're going
in a different direction, so...

307
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,374
you're out.

308
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,126
What the fuck?

309
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,878
You just said
everything was fine.

310
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,422
You're gonna have a whole year
of parades.

311
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,007
Tribute concerts.

312
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,842
You're gonna hit
the talk show circuit.

313
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,802
You're-you're gonna have
your own reality show

314
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,137
on Vought+.

315
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,014
The outpouring of love
and gratitude

316
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,181
is gonna be off the charts.

317
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,767
Oh, this is bullshit!

318
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,854
You used to get
my fucking coffee!

319
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,067
Oh, fuck this. I'm not going.

320
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,862
A-Train... you can't run.

321
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,989
Yes, I can run.

322
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,949
- I just... I-I just...
- Buddy?

323
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,036
You think I don't
know what's been going on?

324
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,664
It's your heart.

325
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,250
I doubt you're even cracking
the top 20 anymore,

326
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,295
and that makes The Seven...
Me... look pretty ridiculous.

327
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,048
I do want you to know, though,

328
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,341
this was really hard for me.

329
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,550
Okay?

330
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,927
It's nothing personal.

331
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,304
Uh, we'll always be friends
and, uh...

332

Et cetera.

333

Attaboy.

334
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,954
Does anyone mind
if I put on some music?

335
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,996

This ain't no little Vegas
road trip, okay?

360
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,724
Y'all ain't on no date, either.

361
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,184
Just... chill.

362
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm not your goddamn chaperone.

363
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,236
They say if you love someone,

364
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,906
you should set them free.
But that seems crazy to me,

365
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,452
because if you love someone,
you will never let them go.

366
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,870
Never.

367
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,914
Have you heard of
the Lovers of Valdaro?

368
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,167
They were alive, like,
6,000 years ago,

369
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,461
and they were found
in this tomb in Italy.

370
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,923
These two skeletons with
their arms around each other.

371
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,053
That's love.

372
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,455
Open up the door.

373
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,126
Bonjour.

374
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,462
You smell like a wet dog.

375
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,923
Oh, you want a drink?

376
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,466
Mm-mm.

377
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,760
Whoa.
Who says I'm alone, asshole?

378
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,486
So... are you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

379
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,531
Or you just gonna
stain my clean sheets

380
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,407
with your sweaty despair?

381
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,537
I tried to kiss her.

382
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,497
Kimiko?

383
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,582
Her brother died.

384
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,502
I wanted to
make her feel better.

385
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,420
You thought a kiss
would make her feel better

386
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,630
or you feel better?

387
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,258
She was in pain.
I wanted to help.

388
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,426
You always want to help.

389
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,636
So?

390
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,347
You think

391
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,724
that by saving her,

392
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,143
you can make amends

393
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,770
for all the people you hurt.

394
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:04,402
For those children
that Lamplighter burned.

395
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,613
- Okay.
- You don't know anything.

396
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,703
Look, she's not a kitten
up a tree.

397
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,333
Just leave her alone. Hmm?

398
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,836
Let her grieve.

399
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,882
What good does grieving
all alone ever do?

400
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,093
And in our continuing coverage

401
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,679
of the recent revelations
over Compound V,

402
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:32,930
protesters all over
the Middle East

403
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:33,973
have taken to the streets
demanding...

404
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,142
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.

405
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,026
Meanwhile,
at the United Nations,

406
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,903
governments from all over the
world have voiced their anger

407
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,322
at the Compound V revelation.

408
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,199
- Mm.
- Today, Russia and China

409
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,118
referred to the superheroes
as weapons of mass destruction

410
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,871
- and accused the United States of terrorism...
- Mm.

411
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,998
You two want a room?

412
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,419
You and the doughnut.

413
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,087
Oh.

414
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm sorry.

415
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,965
It's just, um,

416
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,677
my mom never let me
have this stuff.

417
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,805
- Hmm.
- It's just... Weight gain in our household

418
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,724
was a capital crime.

419
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,477
But my dad, um,

420
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,187
he'd take me to Dunkin'
on the sly.

421
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,775
And he would get me a chocolate
cream-filled doughnut,

422
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,237
and he'd ask me
to tell him about my day.

423
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,411
And he'd... he'd listen.

424
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,832
Baskin-Robbins.

425
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,628
Every Sunday after church.

426
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,049
My pops, he'd always ask

427
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,592
for samples.

428
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,845
Now, this place had 31 flavors,

429
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,182
and that man would taste
each and every flavor

430
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,351
every time we'd go up in there.

431
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,936
There'd be a line
all the way out the door.

432
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,938
People would be mad as hell.
Yelling.

433
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,606
Cussing. "Yo, my man,

434
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,942
get your fucking ice cream
and bounce!"

435
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,610
You think that stopped him?

436
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,529
Hell, nah.
He would stand right there

437
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,155
and order another sample.

438
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,450
"Can I please try the Jamoca
Almond Fudge, please?"

439
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,454
My ass was so embarrassed.

440
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,164
I'd be sitting there,
wishing the floor

441
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,834
would just open up
and just swallow me whole.

442
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,503
Man.

443
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,007
Course, now I'd give a year off
my life just to be able

444
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,134
to see that man going through
spoon after spoon

445
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,886
just one last time.

446
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,433
When did he...

447
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,976
16 years ago.

448
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,483
To fathers and sugar.

449
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,778
To fathers and sugar.

450
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you dry wiping?

451
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,125
Am I what?

452
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,793
Come here.

453
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,670
Listen, any part of your body,

454
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,255
- and I mean any part...
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,592
When you dry wipe,
you're not cleaning anything.

456
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,344
You're just smearing shit
all over your skin.

457
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,139
Here. Got to use wet wipes.
There you go.

458
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,767
- You just carry these around with you?
- Damn right...

459
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,276
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, please!

460
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,486
They're hurt!

461
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,904
- They need help!
- No, please. No, no, no.

462
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,280
This is not the time
to be a Supe.

463
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,948
Okay? We're low-key,
not with us here.

464
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,116
- Annie?
- I...

465
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,534
There's a ton of people here.

466
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,620
Okay, that guy,
he's calling 911.

467
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,081
It'll be okay.

468
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,792
Come on. Come on, we gotta go.

469
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,794
- This was a bad idea. This was a stupid idea.
- Just calm down, calm down.

470
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,531
Any place around here without
a million bloody cameras?

471
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,368
Are you okay?

472
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,828
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

473
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,038
I'm okay, I'm fine.

474
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,709
I thought you were dead.

475
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,502
I stopped looking.
I shouldn't have stopped.

476
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,629
I couldn't call anybody.
I can't imagine

477
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,298
what it must've done to you.
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,633
I'm so fucking sorry.

479
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,719
No, you've done nothing wrong.

480
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,685
Look at you.

481
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,105
My girl.

482
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,816
Always.

483
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,033
Billy, it's not safe
for you to be here.

484
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,203
If he finds you,
he's gonna kill you

485
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,913
and you know that.

486
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,915
Fuck him.

487
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,917
I got out of the last scrape
all right, didn't I?

488
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,668
That was a one-time deal.

489
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
What did you say to him?

490
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,632
I said if he hurt you...

491
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,593
I would kill myself
in front of Ryan.

492
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,637
And my last words would be,

493
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,805
"Your father did this to me."

494
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,060
He seems desperate for
a relationship with his son,

495
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,770
so it worked once.

496
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,439
Well, it's a good thing

497
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,483
he don't know your tells.

498
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,443
I wasn't bluffing.

499
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,197
I'm gonna get you
the fuck out of here.

500
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,823
Yeah, how?

501
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,369
Over the fence,
the same way that I came in.

502
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,954
No, no.

503
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,122
Ryan-Ryan can't
climb that fence.

504
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,793
Right.

505
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,384
I saw his-his eyes glow.

506
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,468
I thought he might...

507
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,761
Don't he got no powers?

508
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,763
N-No, I-I mean...

509
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,516
Yes, but I'm not...
I'm not raising him like that.

510
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,314
Hey.

511
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,024
There's a garbage truck.

512
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,777
It comes by the house
every morning at 11:00.

513
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,488
I doubt anyone
checks the hopper.

514
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,864
You sure it's not
a fucking compacter?

515
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,157
Yes, I'm sure.

516
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,035
Okay.

517
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,370
Then that's the plan.

518
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,664
Yeah, yeah.

519
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,922
I have to go.

520
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,633
They get suspicious
when I'm gone too long.

521
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,097
Wait here, I'll be back.

522
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,141
Okay?

523
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,029
Okay, so, we got two rooms.

524
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,073
There's three of us,
so I guess I'll be, uh...

525
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,620
bunking with M.M., naturally.

526
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,954
Good choice.

527
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,278
Mmm.

528
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,988
- Is that an Almond Joy?
- Mm-hmm.

529
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,241
Nobody likes Almond Joy.

530
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,243
Jeffrey Dahmer...

531
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,454
That's it, he's the only one.

532
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,457
This in my top three for sure.

533
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,875
What are your other two?

534
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,669
Mm...

535
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,921
Charleston Chew...

536
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,297
and Bit-O-Honey.

537
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,091
Jesus Christ!

538
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,301
Those are the, like,
three worst candy bars

539
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,761
in the history of candy!

540
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,554
That's it, you're-you're sick.

541
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,181
In the brain.

542
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,647
Hey, what's up with M.M.'s OCD?

543
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,065
Wait, what-what OCD?

544
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,527
You know, when he changes lanes,

545
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,780
he taps the steering wheel
three times.

546
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,659
He stirs the coffee three times.

547
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,452
The antiseptic wipes... Really?

548
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,162
You haven't noticed any of this?

549
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,872
No, but wow, you're right.

550
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,249
Mm-hmm.

551
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,584
Yeah.

552
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,130
It's just control over things
he can't control, I guess.

553
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,632
I mean...

554
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,885
I should be the last one
talking about that.

555
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,973
Says the girl who's
just stress-eating all day.

556
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,307
Oh, my God!

557
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,642
That was... I...

558
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,436
Was so good,
that was really good.

559
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,479
I enjoyed that.

560
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,358
It's harder than it looked.

561
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,193
Nah.

562
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,570
I think, you know,
actually, I think I went

563
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,572
the other way with the eating.

564
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,408
I think I lost,
like, seven pounds.

565
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,826
Mm.

566
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,578
I did not have seven to lose.

567
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,205
Well... oh, I sleep

568
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,916
about four hours a night.

569
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,085
I wish I slept
four hours a night.

570
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,879
I mean, I'm too busy

571
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,174
chewing my fingernails
down to the quick.

572
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,593
I don't know, whatever a...

573
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,220
I don't know
what a quick is, but...

574
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,514
Here's one.

575
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,604
I walk around the Seven Tower

576
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,647
with this...

577
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,609
knot in my gut.

578
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,152
Just wondering

579
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,821
if Homelander is waiting

580
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,658
around every corner to kill me.

581
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,288
It's like living with
a loaded gun in my face.

582
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,374
Do you feel that way now?

583
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,068
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

584
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,486
I got it.

585
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,119
But I still want to see you.

586
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,291
Love is a leap of faith.

587
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,212
Like, my last boyfriend
was obsessed with Ed Sheeran.

588
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,005
Yeah, I know.

589
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,049
But he was obsessed.

590
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,469
"Shape of You," "Galway Girl,"
whole catalog.

591
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,596
So, he asked me

592
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,640
to get one of these with him.

593
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,437
Two weeks later,
he broke up with me.

594
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,649
I fucking hate Ed Sheeran.

595
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,554
Took you ages to quit.

596
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,390
All them little patches, eh?

597
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,436
Do you want one?

598
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,438
No.

599
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,576
The beard's new.

600
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,996
Fancy it, eh?

601
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,415
Eh, haven't decided yet.

602
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,964
How long you been here
for then, eh?

603
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,802
Since I gave birth.

604
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,806
Fucking hell.

605
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,268
How you holding up?

606
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,483
Yeah, you know, you forget about

607
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,236
reading the news or...

608
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,322
going to a restaurant...

609
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,742
smoking pot on the couch
and eating Cheetos.

610
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,955
I just act like, you know,

611
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,999
Carol fucking Brady all day.

612
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,545
It's okay.

613
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,090
You know, Ryan's happy, and...

614
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,591
that's what matters.

615
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,974
You're gonna like him.

616
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,520
He's sweet...

617
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,064
and very smart and...

618
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,525
so kind.

619
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,613
I know you hate kids and all,
but I think that he's pretty...

620
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,408
Oh, no, no, no, I don't,
I don't hate kids.

621
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,703
Just...

622
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,497
I'm not a very good
role model, am I?

623
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,128
How have you been?

624
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,215
Oh, you know, all right.

625
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,054
Started a private
security company.

626
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,974
You know, weddings,
bar mitzvahs...

627
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,435
Bullshit.

628
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,273
Homelander said you were

629
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,776
"a man possessed."

630
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,945
He said you've been chasing
after him for years.

631
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,408
Well, I thought he killed you.

632
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,660
So... yeah.

633
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,954
I've been on a bit of a warpath.

634
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,458
But on the bright side,

635
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm sleeping in a basement

636
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,754
beneath a pawn shop
in East Flatbush.

637
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,883
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,719
I never wanted that for you.

639
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,972
What was I supposed to do?

640
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,516
Hmm?

641
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,185
Let him get away with it?

642
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,771
What was I before you?

643
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,315
Nothing.

644
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,860
And you saved me.

645
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,946
And here you've been,

646
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,156
fucking living in this shithole

647
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,075
for all this time,

648
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,619
and I haven't been here for you.

649
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,791
I'm gonna make it up to you.

650
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,794
I'm gonna make it up to you
from now till the day I die,

651
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,754
I swear to God.

652
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,743
Is the supervillain threat real?

653
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,911
Hundred percent.

654
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,830
Very real.

655
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,290
But The Seven will protect you.

656
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,876
That's right, right.
Always listen to Maeve.

657
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,044
She always tells the truth.

658
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,630
And we're grateful every day.

659
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,425
On a related subject,
Compound V.

660
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,261
Did either of you know about it
before the news broke?

661
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,388
No. Absolutely not.

662
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,974
Madelyn Stillwell,
she lied to all of us.

663
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,809
Turns out she was a monster.

664
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,979
We're-we're just as hurt
and upset and confused

665
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,814
as everyone else.

666
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,317
Let's talk #HeroesSoWhite.

667
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,861
The numbers are
rather startling.

668
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,988
92% of heroes are Caucasian.

669
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,991
African American, six percent.

670
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,952
Latin and Asian,
each one percent.

671
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,622
Why doesn't Vought
want diversity?

672
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,626
Wow. These are real hardballs,
Maria Menounos.

673
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,712
But check your facts.

674
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,673
Let's, uh, take The Seven,
for example.

675
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,467
We've got A-Train.
He's a black man.

676
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,262
We got Black Noir. He, um...

677
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,848
Well, he doesn't identify
with any race, really,

678
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,434
so... they're covered.

679
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,938
And... we have a gay hero.

680
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,232
Really?

681
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,359
Who in The Seven is gay?

682
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,986
Queen Maeve.

683
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,989
Mm-hmm. Scoop for you, Maria.

684
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,117
Maeve here is a strong,
proud lesbian

685
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,371
with a beautiful girlfriend,
Elena.

686
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,830
Hispanic girlfriend.

687
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:25,085
And I, for one,
am so proud of her.

688
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,128
Where's Elena?

689
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,714
What did you do to her?

690
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,383
She's fine.

691
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,177
What did I do to her?
I set her free.

692
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,554
And you. You've been living
in the shadows so long,

693
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,765
doesn't it feel good
to be out in the sun?

694
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,600
Hold on.

695
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,395
Me and Elena are just friends.

696
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,772
- Oh. Just friends?
- Yes.

697
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,399
Because, see, I heard you two
talking on the phone,

698
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,943
and it sounded
a little more than friends.

699
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,904
So, I did a little digging,

700
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,615
and imagine my fucking surprise.

701
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,951
Okay.

702
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,954
- We had a relationship once.
- Hmm.

703
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,373
Once. A relationship...
"Relationship."

704
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:06,793
That's such a vague word.
What does that mean to you?

705
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,795
What, long walks in the park?

706
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,839
A shoulder to cry on?

707
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,174
Scissoring each other raw?

708
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:17,637
I ended the relationship
when I joined The Seven.

709
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:20,807
When I met you.

710
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,184
Stop fucking lying to me.

711
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:29,274
I am at my wit's fucking end
with the lies.

712
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,236
We're together.

713
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,488
And you love her?

714
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,036
Hmm.

715
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,455
I see.

716
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,333
Well, best of luck to you both.

717
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:52,255
Oh, is it so hard to believe
that I want you two to be happy?

718
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,507
And in love?

719
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,093
Honestly, Maeve, I am

720
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:01,765
really, really happy for you.

721
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,822
And have you seen
Vought's "Saving America" ads?

722
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:22,202
Don't they make you feel all
warm and squishy and patriotic?

723
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:28,792
Vought wants you
to feel calm and safe

724
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,669
so that you continue to buy
their shitty toys

725
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,089
and drinking
their shitty energy drinks

726
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,591
and going to see their shitty movies.

727
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,969
But maybe we shouldn't
feel so calm.

728
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,138
Or safe.

729
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,184
One Super terrorist
has already gotten through.

730
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,852
More will come.

731
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,521
And for all we know,

732
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,357
these maniacs could already have
flown over our borders

733
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,401
and be standing next to you,

734
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,903
just waiting for their chance
to kill us all.

735
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,488
So what are we gonna do?

736
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,323
We're gonna sit around
and cross our fingers

737
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,785
that Homelander's gonna save us
when he's not on Maria Menounos?

738
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,286
No!

739
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,205
Or will we demand

740
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,249
that Vought do better?

741
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,003
That our government do better!

742
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,672
What do you say?

743
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,391
No.

744
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,519
Mon coeur, please.
You will not survive.

745
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,146
Stormfront!
Stormfront!

746
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,481
Stormfront! Stormfront!

747
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,944
Marry me, Stormfront!

748
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,782
Let's go home.

749
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,764
- Hello?
- Uh,

750
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,267
hello, um...

751
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,561
I'm Hughie.
Is-is there, by any chance,

752
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,646
a woman living here
who used to go by the name

753
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,690
of, um, Liberty?

754
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,111
No.

755
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,614
Okay, we have the right address, right?

756
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,240
Is that...?

757
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,836
- Please leave.
- Miss,

758
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,214
I'm sorry if my friend
offended you.

759
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,257
But we just want to ask
just a couple of questions.

760
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,301
Just leave me alone.

761
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,137
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

762
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,388
and I have kept my mouth shut.

763
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,349
You think we're w...
We're not with Vought.

764
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,100
Okay? We...

765
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,228
We just want to learn
what we can about Liberty.

766
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,521
That's it.

767
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,190
Then y'all are just
some damn fools.

768
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,816
It sounds like you know her.

769
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,777
Or knew her.

770
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,946
You're wasting your time.

771
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,657
- Okay?
- Miss, Miss, Miss. Hear us out.

772
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,826
If, after that,
you want us to leave, we'll go.

773
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,163
Go ahead.

774
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:17,377
My father was a lawyer.

775
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,630
Small-time, very smart.
And aggressive.

776
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,549
When I was a kid, something
happened between my family

777
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,802
and Vought, which I'd rather not
talk about, but it was bad.

778
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,846
Now, see, my dad,
he believed in the law

779
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:33,059
and that nobody was above it,
not even Vought.

780
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,312
So he went to work.
He got after their asses.

781
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,398
He had one of those...

782
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,191
Remember
those little black typewriters,

783
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,568
manual ones with the keys?

784
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,444
I'd go to sleep at night
to all that noise,

785
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,154
my father banging away
at that thing.

786
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,616
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

787
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,368
All night.

788
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,037
But see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one black man

789
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,664
put his foot on their necks.

790
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,291
Mm-mm.

791
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,043
So they hired teams of lawyers.

792
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,920
Paid off judges.

793
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,298
But my father never gave up.

794
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,718
Till one morning
I woke up and...

795
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,888
I didn't hear
those keys anymore.

796
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,225
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

797
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,227
I'm so sorry for your loss.

798
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,730
I'm not here for your sympathy.

799
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:23,318
But I am gonna tell you that
his fight got passed down to me.

800
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,030
And I'm gonna make Vought pay
for what they did to him

801
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,406
and, ma'am, from what I gather,

802
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,700
what they've done to you,
as well.

803
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,288
I mean... it's been 48 years.

804
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,915
What good is dredging
all this stuff up now gonna do?

805
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,209
Honestly we don't know.

806
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,878
But we still need to hear it.

807
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,802
I tried to get people to listen.

808
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,723
Lord knows,
so many times, I tried.

809
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,601
But a little black girl accusing

810
00:48:56,643 --> 00:49:00,563
a white superhero of murder
in these parts?

811
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,773
Yeah.

812
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,487
It was during
one of those summer rains

813
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,447
that you just knew was coming

814
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,449
by the smell in the air.

815
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,790
I was 11 years old,

816
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,043
asleep in the back seat
of my folks' Ford.

817
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,380
My brother Myron,
he was driving.

818
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,550
What's the trouble, ma'am?

819
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,551
Get out.

820
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:31,886
Hey.

821
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,681
Your car was
involved in a robbery tonight.

822
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,099
No, it wasn't. I-I had it.

823
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,975
I don't know nothing
about any robbery.

824
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,311
Just confess.

825
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,231
Why are you doing this

826
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,316
to me, lady?
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

827
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,901
I am a hero.

828
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:49,570
For killing a black
piece of shit like you.

829
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,212
I wanted to go to the police.

830
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,631
But my folks,

831
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,217
they thought it was pointless.

832
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,261
So when that man from Vought,

833
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,348
when he showed up and he offered
us that money, we just took it.

834
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:21,185
$2,000.

835
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,605
That is what my brother's life
was worth.

836
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,775
Just $2,000.

837
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,777
But y'all have got to promise me

838
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,780
that you won't tell anybody that
I sat here and I talked to you.

839
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,616
Because if that woman finds out
that I opened my mouth,

840
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,034
she's gonna kill me.

841
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,036
Ms. Hunter,

842
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,582
that woman, L-Liberty,

843
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,793
n-nobody's seen her since 1979.

844
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,378
I mean,
she's probably dead by now.

845
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,213
Oh, no, no.

846
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,424
I...

847
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,183
Right here.

848
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,894
That's her. Right there.

849
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,854
That's Liberty.

850
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,903
Valerie was just a little girl,

851
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,405
and she said it was raining,
so she could be wrong.

852
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,157
She seemed pretty certain.

853
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,534
Yeah, but if Liberty and
Stormfront are the same person,

854
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,328
then that makes Stormfront,
like, what, like, 70 years old?

855
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,122
- More?
- Yeah, but who knows what Compound V can do?

856
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:26,334
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person. Okay?

857
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,127
This is the same Stormfront
that just became

858
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,046
- America's favorite two-fisted Supe.
- Mm-hmm.

859
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,673
And might've popped Raynor's
head for getting too close.

860
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,510
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is going on?

861
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,769
I didn't know that
about your dad.

862
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,731
Sounds like he was a real hero.

863
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:52,235
I thought so, but...

864
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:57,073
Nah. He's just a man
with a disease.

865
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,034
He passed it down to me,
and if I'm not too careful,

866
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,912
I might end up
passing it down to my...

867
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,537
Who the
fuck do you think you are?

868
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,331
What, you think I don't see it?

869
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,585
Trying to undermine me,
steal my team...

870
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,420
- Hold on a minute.
- Let me tell you right now,

871
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,881
it won't work.

872
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,967
I'm the face of The Seven!
Not you!

873
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:01,012
Me. I still score higher
in every demo that counts.

874
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,682
18 to 34, 18 to 49, 25 to 54,

875
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:08,102
they all love me.

876
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:11,105
Well, congratulations.

877
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:15,318
I mean, this constant need
to be loved by everyone

878
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,530
is kind of pathetic,
but, um, yay.

879
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,371
Okay.

880
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:31,083
Okay. Calm down.

881
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,378
I clearly pushed you
a little far. I'm sorry.

882
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,924
Look, I'm... I'm just trying to help.

883
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,468
Really? How?

884
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,095
By taking what's mine?

885
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,014
Let me tell you something
right now:

886
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,891
I built this team
from the ground up,

887
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,477
and there is no fucking way
that anyone

888
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,978
is gonna take it away from me.

889
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,606
You spent $273 million

890
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,358
on that "Saving America"
bullshit,

891
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,151
and I am running circles
around you

892
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,488
with five guys on laptops
churning out memes.

893
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,532
I practically pay them
with Arby's gift cards.

894
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,493
You...

895
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,037
You can't win
the whole country anymore.

896
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,039
No one can.

897
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,416
So why are you even trying?

898
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:16,087
You don't need 50 million people
to love you.

899
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,132
You need five million people
fucking pissed.

900
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:23,386
Emotion sells, anger sells.

901
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,638
You have fans.

902
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,974
I have soldiers.

903
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:33,062
Look, I know that

904
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,440
you probably won't believe this.

905
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,567
I think that you

906
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,611
are the best of us.

907
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,240
I think that you

908
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,036
are everything we should be.

909
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:52,957
You just need a little help
connecting with your audience.

910
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,128
You know, change with the times.

911
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,422
God knows I did.

912
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,516
I don't need help connecting
with my audience.

913
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:12,977
Thank you.

914
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,688
Okay. Well, just know
I'm always here,

915
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,734
door is always open
for anything.

916
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,124
You're late. Where's the kid?

917
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:42,548
Babe, we got to get in the truck
or we'll miss our chance.

918
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,300
I'm-I'm not leaving.

919
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,551
What are you talking about?
Of course you are.

920
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,927
Grab the kid and let's go.

921
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,596
You don't really want Ryan
to come with us.

922
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,514
Of course I do.
I said I'd take him, didn't I?

923
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,975
And I wanted to believe you.

924
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:59,023
Then believe me. Now come on,
we've got to get a shift on.

925
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,442
Listen,
if the three of us leave,

926
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:04,111
you're gonna find a way
to get rid of him.

927
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,529
I know it.

928
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,448
It won't be in an obvious way,
and it won't be right away,

929
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,075
- but you will.
- No, Becca, no.

930
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,494
Billy, I know you.
I know you better than anybody,

931
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,370
and I saw it
in your face last night.

932
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,331
I see it now.

933
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,130
He's a billion-dollar piece
of Vought property.

934
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,967
They are not gonna let him go.

935
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:32,473
You and me, Becca, you and me,
we've got a chance.

936
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:35,017
Babe, it's Ryan
they care about, not us.

937
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,560
Yeah, and then what?

938
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,813
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

939
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,314
Then we have Homelander
all over again,

940
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,024
then there's two fucking
assholes in this world.

941
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,568
We could disappear, all right?
Just start again,

942
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,195
- start a new family.
- I have a son!

943
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,947
He's a fucking Supe freak.

944
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,743
Fuck. I'm... Listen, I...

945
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:56,163
I'm sorry, I d...
I didn't mean that.

946
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,582
Becca.

947
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,293
Becca, please come with me.

948
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,713
You were wrong about me,
do you know that?

949
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,966
You put me on this pedestal,

950
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:10,970
and the truth is,
I never knew how to save you.

951
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,222
You were always
one-one bad day away

952
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,432
from pounding someone to death
in a parking lot.

953
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,476
That's not true.

954
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:21,313
Billy.

955
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,900
He raped me, and when
I found out I was pregnant,

956
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,903
I went to Vought.

957
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,530
I didn't come to you.

958
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:34,910
I didn't come to you
because I was scared,

959
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,704
'cause I knew that
you'd chase after him

960
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:40,249
and you would seek revenge and
it wouldn't be good for anybody.

961
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,500
I love you.

962
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,544
I love you.

963
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,090
But the hate that you carry

964
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,552
and the warpath that you're on,

965
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,263
it started so long before me.

966
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,850
I can't.

967
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,447
Becs, I'm not leaving
without you.

968
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,908
You have to go, please.

969
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,244
Every guard in this goddamn place

970
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:20,206
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

971
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:24,043
You have to go.

972
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,879
I'm sorry.

973
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,840
I'm so sorry.

974
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,192
Oh, shit.

975
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,498
- Small token of the trip.
- Mmm.

976
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,750
You know, John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

977
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,793
when he was a birthday clown.

978
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,087
Whatever, I still love them.

979
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,673
Thanks for letting me come.

980
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,299
It was fun

981
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:16,387
- until it got so horrible.
- Yeah.

982
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,348
What can I say? It's my specialty.

983
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,768
Well, um,

984
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,355
listen, if you're ever in
the mood for another Almond Joy,

985
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,565
just-just shoot me a text.

986
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,192
That came out so gross.
I'm sorry.

987
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,236
Hughie.

988
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,572
We can't do that again.

989
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:39,576
No, no, no, no. No, we can't.

990
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,995
Why, though?

991
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,373
I mean, th... this is...
this is good.

992
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,250
But that's just it.

993
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:51,130
I mean, we can't afford
to feel good or to feel safe

994
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,257
or to let our guard down.

995
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,134
You can't go through this
on your own.

996
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,013
We're all alone.

997
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,850
That's the truth.

998
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,311
But it doesn't have
to be like that.

999
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,446
Goodbye, Hughie.

1000
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,510
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

1001
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,430
is to be willing...

1002
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,350
to do anything for your man.

1003
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,810
Anything.

1004
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,479
I'm a feminist,

1005
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,649
but I'm also very sexual,

1006
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,819
and I don't see that
as contradictory.

1007
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,948
What's wrong
with giving pleasure

1008
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,992
and receiving it?

1009
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:05,329
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.

1010
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,207
Yeah, we appreciate your candor.

1011
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,000
Thank you so much.

1012
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,419
Anytime. It was really great
meeting you.

1013
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,670
Really great.

1014
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,839
So great.

1015
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,555
Bye.

1016
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,642
Her. Gianna.
I choose her.

1017
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,936
I mean, she's the one,
no question.

1018
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,979
No, she isn't.

1019
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,189
Wait, what?

1020
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:34,274
She was, like,
hands down the winner.

1021
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,943
It was not even a contest.

1022
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,861
It's Cassandra.

1023
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,989
Cassandra? The one...
the one with the hair

1024
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,950
and the creepy skeletons
hugging each other story?

1025
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,201
Yes.

1026
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,577
That's your wife.

1027
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,123
Oh... But...

1028
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,125
but I thought I got to choose.

1029
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,378
You do, and you're
choosing Cassandra.

1030
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,171
Congratulations.

1031
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,675
Yeah, but, I mean, Gianna...

1032
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,720
Is lovely. She's lovely. She's a
valued member of The Collective,

1033
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,514
but this marriage isn't about

1034
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:08,016
satisfying your base desires.

1035
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,561
It's about rehabilitating
your image

1036
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,688
and getting you back
in The Seven.

1037
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,315
That is what you want, isn't it?

1038
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,129
There you are.

1039
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,013
I was beginning to worry.

1040
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,107
Oh, I missed you.

1041
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,864
Are you thirsty?

1042
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,409
Want some?

1043
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,457
Aw, I want you so bad.

1044
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,841
Are you okay?

1045
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,344
Would you like me
to be someone else?

1046
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,222
I can be whoever you want.

1047
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,814
No.

1048
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,860
I don't need anyone...

1049
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,031
but myself.

1050
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,466
Like what you see?

1051
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,511
See how hot you are?

1052
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,347
Hmm?

1053
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,768
Come on.

1054
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,814
How much do you want this?

1055
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,859
How much?

1056
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,246
I'm gonna suck your cock
so fucking hard,

1057
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:37,082
so good,

1058
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,502
and you're gonna look
in your own eyes when you come.

1059
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,464
It's not even gay

1060
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,384
if it's with yourself, right?

1061
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,972
Oh,

1062
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:54,891
you're so special,

1063
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:58,020
the most special man

1064
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,355
on the planet.

1065
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,359
Everybody loves you.

1066
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,237
Everybody.

1067
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,906
Their love

1068
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,285
is your strength.

1069
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,007
You're pathetic.

1070
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,230
I don't need everyone
to love me.

1071
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,734
I don't need anyone.

1072
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,783
I don't

1073
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,869
need you!
