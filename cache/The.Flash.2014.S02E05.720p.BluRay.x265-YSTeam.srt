1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,094
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,098
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,308
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,312
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,606
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother, but in doing so,

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,022
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,318
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,949
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,367
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,832
I get a vision of something
that's already happened.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,158
And then it's gone.

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,290
I don't want anyone to know about this.

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,500
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

14
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:41,674
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,000
Connecting our two Earths.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,008
Fifty-two breaches in Central City

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,509
and the biggest one
just happens to be in our basement.

18
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:51,058
The person who broke into my facility
last night was Harrison Wells.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,390
Hey! Put him down!

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,061
Who the hell are you?

21
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:03,650
Hello.

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,367
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Harrison Wells.

23
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,495
Today, the future has arrived.

24
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:18,045
Our city has seen incredible,
impossible things.

25
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,545
Meta-humans, men and women
with extraordinary abilities.

26
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:28,051
The ability to soar above buildings,
to run faster than the speed of light.

27
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,054
Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans

28
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,353
have chosen the wrong path
with these powers. A dark path.

29
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,518
My team and I at S.T.A.R. Labs

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,853
are committed to keeping up
with these perilous times.

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,067
And so, may I present to you our new line
of "Meta-Human Awareness" apps.

32
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,617
This technology will allow you

33
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,408
to instantly detect the presence
of a meta-human.

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,543
You'll be instantly alerted to an
approaching speedster like Zoom or like...

35
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,137
Flash.

36
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,936
Welcome, Flash.

37
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,557
Tell them the truth, Dr. Wells.

38
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,437
Everything that has happened to this city,
the past two years, is because of you.

39
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,771
You created all of us metas.
You created Zoom.

40
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,979
I created Zoom?

41
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,899
Eleven hours
before the first meta-sighting,

42
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,945
enormous blasts of dark matter radiation,
were silently expelled beneath this lab.

43
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,783
I'm sorry, Flash. I believe all this fast
running may have scrambled your brain.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,789
You take no responsibility for
the wreckage your mistakes have caused.

45
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:45,591
Admit it, Wells. And then maybe, you can
truly help me do something about it.

46
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,590
Help you? Because I'm the greatest
tech entrepreneur of all time.

47
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,425
You're the superhero.

48
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,588
And we would all be safe,

49
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,176
if you would just do yourjob
and stop Zoom.

50
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,937
Well, I guess it's safe to say
the speedster sensors work.

51
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,775
- Are you okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, sweetie.

52
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,284
Now, where was I?

53
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,616
Oh, that's right. The future.

54
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,837
Very strange to be holding
your autobiography.

55
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,841
Especially when you didn't write it.
And it's not about you.

56
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:39,473
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

57
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,850
So, let me get this straight.

59
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,688
You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

60
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,320
and is responsible for both
Ronnie and Eddie's deaths.

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,156
Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger
of the Dr. Wells that we knew,

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,867
because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over by the Reverse-Flash

63
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:04,044
who was really Eobard Thawne, and
Eddie's distant relative from the future.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,043
Yeah, I didn't follow any of that.
I'm my own man.

65
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,753
I had nothing to do with the murder
of your mother, or your friend Ricky.

66
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,009
- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

67
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,762
You told me you have proof
of your identity.

68
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,723
This almost hit me
when I went through the portal.

69
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:21,894
Your stabilized breach downstairs connects
directly to the S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

70
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,064
Technically, this could be mine.
But I want to run some tests on you.

71
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,608
I'll be genetically indistinguishable
from my Earth-1 counterpart.

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,103
Your tests will reveal nothing.

73
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,571
- Great! Still gonna run 'em.
- Be my guest.

74
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,069
Why are we even listening to him?

75
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,899
How do we know he's not evil,
like the other guy?

76
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,610
He saved my life last night.

77
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,237
The question is why.

78
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,449
I'm guessing you didn't travel between
dimensions just to meet the Flash.

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,033
That's exactly what I did.

80
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,295
I came here to help you, Barry.
To stop your greatest enemy.

81
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,913
- He already did that.
- I'm not talking about Reverse-Flash.

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,543
I'm talking about Zoom.

83
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,043
I see you've already heard of him.

84
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,088
Yeah, Zoom has been sending
meta-humans from your world

85
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,923
through the breaches to fight me.

86
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,101
Well, they're the symptoms.
Zoom's the plague.

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,146
One that's infected my world
and now he's coming for yours.

88
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,389
- What do you know about Zoom?
- Everything.

89
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,810
I created Zoom.

90
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,237
I'm responsible for all
the Earth-2 meta-humans.

91
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:17,571
A fact I've ignored for far too long.
But now,

92
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,985
I'm doing something about it.

93
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,829
Yeah, well, we're batting a thousand
against these breachers.

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,834
You're batting a thousand, Crisco?

95
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,420
What's your sample size? Ten?

96
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:33,417
Less? Zoom is obsessed with speed.

97
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,841
He will never allow there to be
another speedster in the multi-verse.

98
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,134
And he's gonna keep
sending these metas here,

99
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,432
one after the next,
all with the same goal.

100
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,935
To kill the Flash.
Unless we stop him. Together.

101
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,475
Last time I listened to a guy with your
face, some bad things went down.

102
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,310
We lost people we cared about.

103
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,112
Everyone loses
someone they care about, Snow.

104
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,115
The real test of character
is what you do once they're gone.

105
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,173
Joe! Put the gun down!

106
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,346
How is he still alive?
How are you still alive?

107
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,423
Well, I don't know. Because you missed?

108
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,850
Hey, I'm trying to keep him from
shooting you. You're not helping.

109
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,269
Let's take a walk, all right?
It's all good.

110
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,225
We know someone who can verify
everything that this guyjust said.

111
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,439
Be careful.

112
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,072
I don't suppose you have a
Big Belly Burger in this universe, do you?

113
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,192
This isn't happening

114
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,490
I know that this is lot to take in,

115
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,788
but that guy, back in that room,
that's not Wells.

116
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:48,413
Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

117
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,119
What? Why didn't you tell me this?

118
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,170
Because I didn't believe her. I didn't
even want to consider Wells was alive.

119
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,420
Eddie erased that Wells from existence.
This guy is...

120
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,596
He's someone else. And he says
he's here to help us stop Zoom.

121
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,764
- How can you even look at him?
- You think this is easy for me?

122
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,593
The guy in there looks, moves, sounds

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,973
exactly like the guy that drove a knife
through my mother's heart.

124
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,646
I have to resist the urge to kill him.

125
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:16,185
I'm trying my best to get past that, okay?
You shooting him, that's not helping.

126
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,324
After all our losses,
I thought at least we were free of Wells.

127
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,869
I just want one week where we're
not surprised by somebody from our past.

128
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,992
I better go fill in Iris.

129
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,577
Good luck.

130
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,502
I hope you're happy, Linda. Tanner's
lawyers are threatening to sue us.

131
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,550
I'm sorry, Chief, I don't care
how many touchdowns Tanner throws,

132
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,221
I'm not interviewing
some 'roided outjerk who hit his wife.

133
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,507
Unless it's to hold him accountable
for domestic violence.

134
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,435
All right. Run your story, Park.

135
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,605
The sports page
used to be a lot less complicated.

136
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,891
She shoots...

137
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,230
She scores.

138
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,691
Larkin's the best editor
I've ever worked for.

139
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,192
It's just every once in a while,

140
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,944
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

141
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,242
Okay.

142
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:15,002
But that's not really him?
The Wells who Eddie gave his life to stop.

143
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,420
Apparently not.

144
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,218
That's life in Central City these days,
right?

145
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,762
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine. Really.

146
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,639
Good.

147
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,757
I wanna keep you that way.

148
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,552
- Dad.
- Take it.

149
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,557
I taught you how to use it for a reason.

150
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,977
And I'm praying that Barry's right
and this Wells means us no harm.

151
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,730
Last year you had Eddie
to look out for you, but now,

152
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,232
you can't murder somebody
that everybody thinks is dead, right?

153
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,572
Put it away.

154
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,581
You do realize that when I said I wanted
a drink, I didn't mean a latte, right?

155
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:58,754
I was talking about alcohol.
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

156
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,423
All right, look,
you got to give him a chance, okay?

157
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,173
He's not a speedster.
He'sjust a regular, normal guy.

158
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,051
From another universe.

159
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,552
I never thought I'd miss time travel.

160
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,304
Time travel, huh?

161
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,265
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi.

162
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,222
Is there, uh,
a meta-human who can time travel?

163
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,144
Time... No. Time travel's not real.

164
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,148
'Cause that would be pretty cool.

165
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,818
Not so sure about that.

166
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,279
Patty, you know Cisco Ramon, right?

167
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,654
Yeah, you're the scientific advisor
on meta-humans to the C.C.P.D., right?

168
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,239
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

169
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,366
Hey, Barr, did you hear?
I was right about King Shark.

170
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,447
- "King Shark"? Nice name.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,578
- I like her.
- Yeah, King Shark almost ate the Flash.

172
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,411
No. I'm sure the Flash had it handled.

173
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,088
Oh, no. I was there. lsaw it all.
Some hooded guy saved his life.

174
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,290
Wait, and you're not, like,
traumatized or anything?

175
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,754
I just watched a half-man half-shark
take on the fastest man alive.

176
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,090
I love this city.

177
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,389
Let's see. Sorry.
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

178
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:59,475
He wants me to write my police report.
Uh, you maybe want to write it with me?

179
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,648
Uh, I can't. Tonight, I'm busy.
I'm... Yeah, sorry.

180
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,650
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- L've just got science stuff.

181
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,405
Stuff I gotta science the stuff out of.
Maybe next time, though...

182
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,283
Yeah. Coolio.

183
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,578
- Yeah.
- Uh...

184
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,455
But I'm gonna actually skip the coffee
and go get a head start. So.

185
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:18,993
- Good to see you guys.
- Oh. Yeah.

186
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,835
- Yeah, yeah. For real?
- Stop, all right?

187
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,633
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark tried to eat me.

188
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,130
And then Dr. Wells, the sequel, showed up.

189
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,429
Okay. Can we not use the name "Dr. Wells"?
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

190
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,677
Okay, Harry. Yeah.

191
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,803
Listen, there's always
going to be Harrys out there.

192
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,261
But you can't let the Harrys of the world
get in the way of you living your life.

193
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,019
Ask Patty out. You gotta be bold.

194
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,643
That's tough talk. When was the last time
you asked a girl for her number?

195
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,023
Watch and learn.

196
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,823
I'm watching.

197
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,405
Hi. What can I get you?

198
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,072
- Hi, there.
- Hi. Again.

199
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,452
Uh...

200
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,455
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yeah, I'll get some...

201
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,711
No, uh... No I don't want coffee.

202
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,917
You know what I do want, though?
I wanna ask you this.

203
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,003
Do you wanna go out with me?

204
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,845
Oh.

205
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,852
Do... Wait, I mean, we could, we could go
get coffee, or we could, like...

206
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,304
No.

207
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,100
That's a no.

208
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,190
It's totally cool. It's cool.

209
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,897
Respect.

210
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,745
Stay back.

211
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,427
Yo, dude, you good? It's her loss.

212
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,269
Hey, what's up?

213
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,065
- We have another breacher.
- What? How do you know?

214
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,017
Central City Bank. You gotta go now.

215
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,317
All right.

216
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,279
You got my attention.

217
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,081
Flash?

218
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,139
Her name is Dr. Light.

219
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,683
Small-time thief on my Earth

220
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,386
until exposed to the dark matter
from the particle accelerator.

221
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,816
Became a meta-human with the ability
to derive power from starlight.

222
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,187
Whoa, very cool.

223
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,986
Stars having a temperature
of 5,300 degrees Kelvin

224
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,940
and a blinding luminosity.
I would say not very cool. At all.

225
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,402
You know, our Dr. Wells may have been evil
but you're just a dick.

226
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,831
Okay, so, obviously, Zoom brought her
here from your Earth, like the others.

227
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,369
Mmm-hmm. Now that we know that,
we can use that to gain advantage.

228
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,960
What do you mean?

229
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,211
We capture Dr. Light.
Then use her to lure Zoom here.

230
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,385
You are insane. Okay?
We are not luring Zoom anywhere.

231
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,304
Apparently, they know each other.
And Jay is not a fan.

232
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,222
Well, well, well. Like everyone else,
I assumed our Earth-2 Flash was dead.

233
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,601
Why am I not surprised
to find Jay Garrick here? Still alive.

234
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,433
And in hiding,
a full universe away from Zoom.

235
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,984
I'm not in hiding.

236
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:36,107
Zoom nearly killed me and stole my speed
before the Singularity pulled me here.

237
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,783
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

238
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,077
Well, whatever the case, in your absence,

239
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,248
Zoom has only
gotten more powerful, faster.

240
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,496
Barry, you have to defeat Zoom now,
while you still can.

241
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,918
No. This isn't the time to be reckless.

242
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,086
We don't even know
why Zoom sent Dr. Light here.

243
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,880
She's a thief, not a killer.

244
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,754
Zoom can make people do things
out of character.

245
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,301
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

246
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,754
All right. Look, hey,
we can decide what to do with Light later.

247
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,307
First, we have to find her. Okay?

248
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,725
Hey, how did you know
that she was breaking into the bank?

249
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,773
I got an alert on my phone.

250
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,197
It's a little ring-a-ding...
Every time there's a robbery at a bank.

251
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,899
- What?
- But you know what?

252
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,575
I think I can get
the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite

253
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,870
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions,

254
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,869
and we can find Dr. Light's light.

255
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,664
Okay. I'm gonna also, um, call Joe.
See if C.C.P.D. has any leads.

256
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,621
Why don't we
keep them apart until I get back.

257
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,298
I'm sure that won't be a problem.

258
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,307
- Hey.
- Hey.

259
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,143
How's your science stuff?

260
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,975
I finished it.
Um, did you get your report done?

261
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,559
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

262
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,230
It wasn't as much fun
writing it by myself, but...

263
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,274
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

264
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,111
Hey, do you ever feel
completely overwhelmed

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,993
by everything that
you have to do in a day,

266
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,039
and it feels like the one thing
that you actually want to do

267
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,625
is the thing that gets lost?

268
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,956
I'm confused. What?

269
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,255
I've been thinking,
for a while now, actually,

270
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,173
would you want to get
dinner with me sometime?

271
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,419
Yeah. This isn't gonna be
one of those things

272
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,881
Where I get really excited and then
more "science stuff" comes up, right?

273
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,933
No, no. That's not, uh... Tomorrow?

274
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,230
We can grab an early dinner.
I don't want to wait anymore.

275
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,274
- Okay.
- Okay.

276
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,817
Looking forward to it.

277
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,245
Hey, Harry. Hey, over here! Hey!

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,460
Come inside, use my work room,
use my computer, I don't care.

279
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,715
Thanks.

280
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:04,889
You and Wells Prime have very different
musical tastes. His were better.

281
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,309
This Harrison Wells and I are very
different, but similar in some respects.

282
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,184
I see he made almost the same mistake
I did with the particle accelerator.

283
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,062
He did a lot of terrible things,
but none of them were by mistake.

284
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,437
What did he do to you?

285
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,357
I know he caused the Singularity, murdered
Barry's mother, blah-blah-blah-blah.

286
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,113
What did he do to you?

287
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,743
You can barely look me in the eye.
Why is that? What did he do to you?

288
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,197
He shoved his hand through my chest.

289
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,205
He stopped my heart.

290
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:40,424
Ouch. Okay, that would do it.
But you survived that?

291
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,378
Only because Barry erased that timeline.

292
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,471
I see. Barry traveled in time.

293
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,890
- Twice.
- Hmm.

294
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,514
Here's how it is.

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,596
- What's the deal?
- You don't have to like me.

296
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,931
I don't like you.

297
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,857
But you have to work with me

298
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,062
To stop Zoom and Dr. Light.
Can you do that?

299
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,648
I guess we'll see, won't we?

300
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:07,405
I guess we will. One more thing...

301
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,076
You said you're gonna
re-task S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite?

302
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,374
To scan for solar emissions, yeah.
We're up and running.

303
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,872
I'd like to examine your program.
I wanna see if it works.

304
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,915
Don't worry. It'll work.

305
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,087
Harry's starting to get on my nerves.

306
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,515
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

307
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:30,807
That's gotta be Dr. Light.

308
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,055
Could be a trap.

309
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,019
Barry, trust me, Dr. Light
is not a killer. You can talk to her.

310
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,564
Okay.

311
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,406
Looking for this?

312
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
I know Zoom sent you here to kill me.

313
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,574
Good news. You don't have to do that.

314
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,579
Not if I can get out of town
with that cash.

315
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,412
And then what? Zoom's not gonna like
that you ditched him, right?

316
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,084
My friends and I can help you.

317
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,915
Nobody can protect me from Zoom.

318
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,423
All right. Why don't we
take it down a lumen,

319
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:11,178
have a normal conversation, all right?
Thank you.

320
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,313
Linda? Linda Park?

321
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,140
How do you know my name?

322
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,519
I don't understand.

323
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,609
This was a mistake.

324
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,820
Barry, what's happening?

325
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,242
I can't see.

326
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,157
Guys, I can't see.

327
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,001
I still can't see.

328
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,500
How long is this gonna last?

329
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,751
You're suffering from solar retinopathy.

330
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:47,381
Your retinas are severely damaged.
You're lucky you're not permanently blind.

331
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,463
But with your rapid regeneration
abilities, your sight should return soon.

332
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,298
6.25 hours, by my estimation.

333
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,383
All this could have been avoided
if you'd just stopped Light

334
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,763
instead of chit-chatting with her.

335
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
She caught Barry off guard.

336
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,929
Always an excuse with you, right?

337
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,266
He's the fastest man alive.
How could she possibly do that?

338
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,943
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend. Linda Park.

339
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,192
That's why Zoom sent her.
Because he knew you'd hesitate.

340
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,534
Well, that means Zoom had to have known,
somehow, that Linda was your ex?

341
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,236
Which is why Barry has to act now,

342
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,366
before Zoom sends another double
from Barry's life.

343
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,824
All right. Right now,
I'm more worried about Linda.

344
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,785
When I saw who was under the mask,
I said her name.

345
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,164
What if Light didn't even realize

346
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,748
That she had a doppelganger here
until I accidentally told her?

347
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,083
The first thing that Atom Smasher did
when he crossed the breach

348
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,759
was to kill his doppelganger.

349
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,551
Yeah, but Light's not like Atom Smasher.

350
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,221
We should keep an eye on your Linda.

351
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,968
All right. I'll go.

352
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,554
- Sorry.
- Bro.

353
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,055
- Barry.
- What?

354
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,056
Okay, okay. You can't do anything, uh,
until your sight returns.

355
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,482
No, no, no. Come on.
Here's the little rail here. I'll do it.

356
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:45,896
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'll go with you.

357
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,688
- Hey, Barry! I came as soon as I...
- Hey.

358
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,442
You look just like him.

359
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,993
I'm guessing my counterpart
did something to offend her as well?

360
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,195
Her fiancé died because of him.

361
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,910
Oh.

362
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,375
Iris, I know it's weird seeing him.

363
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,753
Yes. lt'sjust a lot to process lately.
Wells, my mother...

364
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,508
How are you doing with that, by the way?

365
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,174
I mean, now that she's gone, okay.

366
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,303
Yeah. Iris, um...

367
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,558
- Yeah.
- Look, thanks.

368
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,848
You know you can talk to me about it.

369
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,901
Yeah, I know, but...
But really, I'm fine, okay?

370
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,648
I should be asking how you're doing.

371
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,939
That's me. I got it.

372
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,567
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it. All right.

373
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,405
Uh... "Running a little late. P." Who's P?

374
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:44,292
- Oh, P. That's Patty.
- My dad's partner, Patty?

375
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,246
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is she running late for?

376
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:47,666
Um...

377
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,460
Our first date.

378
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,501
- That's so great. She's great.
- Uh...

379
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,383
Yeah, no, Patty is great.
I just, you know,

380
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,635
I doubt she's gonna give me another shot
when I have to cancel on her.

381
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:58,929
Don't cancel.

382
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:02,936
I'm blind, Iris. A literal "blind date."
That's not gonna work.

383
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,605
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs. Come on.

384
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,354
There's got to be something here
that can help you get through the night.

385
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,650
Yeah.

386
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,020
Or someone.

387
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,991
Cisco. Hey.

388
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,993
To your left. Other left.

389
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,287
Cisco.

390
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,289
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,208
Oh. Sorry.

392
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,923
Okay. She's two steps in front of you.

393
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,422
- Nice glasses.
- Hey. Hey.

394
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,974
- I'm so, so sorry I'm late.
- Touchdown.

395
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,802
No, don't be. Uh, you know,
I actuallyjudge my dates

396
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,559
on whether or not they stand me up.
So you are off to a great start.

397
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,266
What do you mean?
I mean, who would stand you up?

398
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, I have a reputation.

399
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,025
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

400
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,986
That's embarrassing.

401
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,034
You know, I actually, um,
I arrested a boyfriend once.

402
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,325
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

403
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,577
He got really wasted
and decided to insult the waitress.

404
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,829
So I cited him for public intoxication.

405
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,794
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah. Special.

406
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,919
So...

407
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,215
Dude, she looks amazing. You have
to tell her how amazing she looks.

408
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,512
You look amazing, Patty.

409
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,220
Uh, thanks. I actually
had a really hard time

410
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,675
trying to figure out what to wear.

411
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,513
Like, if I should wear a dress or this
color was a little weird. I couldn't...

412
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:32,647
No, you look great. It's, um... Yeah, no,
what would you call that color?

413
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,486
Um, uh...

414
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,689
- I don't know.
- I can't tell. The feed's black and white!

415
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:40,241
Yeah, whatever it is, that color
should thank you for wearing it.

416
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,111
My man!

417
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,616
- It's smooth.
- Not smooth.

418
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,413
Oh, wine list! Here we go.

419
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,205
Uh...

420
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,503
Yes, oh, got it. Thank you.

421
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:54,376
Um...

422
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,175
- You know, why, why don't you... Sorry.
- Oh! That's okay.

423
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,378
The guy always picks.
Why don't you choose?

424
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,761
Yeah. What do you want? Red or white?

425
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,101
Whatever you'd like. Uh...

426
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,849
You've got this. Why do you even need me?

427
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,772
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

428
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,903
- Classic stakeout fuel.
- Yeah.

429
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,734
You have coffee on your Earth, right?

430
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,570
I think coffee is the one constant
in the multi-verse.

431
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,662
So, I don't mean to pry,

432
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,250
but when Wells keeps referring
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

433
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,924
I've fought Zoom many times,
each time barely escaping with my life.

434
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,097
So, yeah. Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

435
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,720
The truth is, Zoom scared me.

436
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,394
He stole the most precious thing from me,
my speed.

437
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:51,931
I didn't want Barry
to suffer the same fate.

438
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:55,108
Well, maybe if you just sat down
with Wells, talk to him about it?

439
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,528
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells, Caitlin.

440
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,355
The guy was more than happy to make money

441
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,361
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps.

442
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,112
So now he's obsessed with Zoom.

443
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,661
Something has changed,
and not just because I disappeared.

444
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,579
Well, I don't trust Wells. I trust you.

445
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,961
So I've actually been dying to ask you.

446
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,883
What was it like
to be struck by lightning?

447
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,211
Um... Life changing, to be honest.

448
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,756
Did it hurt?

449
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,638
I mean, all I really remember is feeling
electricity surging through my body.

450
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,221
It was an intensity I'd never felt.

451
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,932
Like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.

452
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,689
Then I woke up from a coma
nine months later.

453
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:42,272
Waking up in the future like that,
it's like time travel.

454
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,075
- Sort of, yeah.
- Yeah.

455
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,825
Yeah. When I was, um, nine,
I actually drowned.

456
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:51,656
I hit my head on the diving board
and fell into the swimming pool.

457
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,164
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

458
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,169
until my dad rescued me
and saved my life. Yeah.

459
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,798
So I guess we've both cheated death.

460
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,675
I've been through a few things in my life

461
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:08,007
that taught me
not to be afraid of anything.

462
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:11,058
I think fear is what holds people back
from being who they should be.

463
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,891
Oh, preach!

464
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,433
Uh...

465
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,564
Yeah. I'm still here.
Creepin' and peepin'.

466
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:21,692
- You okay?
- Sorry. Yeah, I really agree with that.

467
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,397
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

468
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,536
I think, I think, uh, another thing too,
I think you can't see me.

469
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,194
Abort.

470
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,030
What? What do you mean? I...

471
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,536
I think you can't see me.

472
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,540
Come on. I would not be a good detective
if I couldn't have figured this one out.

473
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,086
So, I don't know...

474
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,794
Uh...

475
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

476
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,506
I'm really sorry and embarrassed,
I didn't say anything.

477
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,884
- I had my pupils dilated earlier.
- Oh, my gosh!

478
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,265
I really didn't want to cancel.

479
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:57,515
Barry! I lost my eyes!

480
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,647
You know, you have a great smile.

481
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,567
Really? How do you know I'm smiling?

482
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,818
Just a hunch.

483
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,744
Okay, so what else
is different about our worlds?

484
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,696
Do you have Tahiti?

485
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,159
Never been, but I do love Atlantis.

486
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,538
As in the lost city,
submerged in the ocean somewhere?

487
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,746
Well, it's actually above water
on my Earth.

488
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:22,250
One of my best friends is from there.

489
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,673
I would love to see it.

490
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,125
It's special.

491
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,845
It's the kind of place
you never want to leave.

492
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,576
Hello, gorgeous. Everybody out. Now!

493
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,005
Go! Go, go, go. Go. Move! Quick.

494
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,502
- Except you.
- I don't think so.

495
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,084
No, no. She's leaving with us.

496
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,795
- Not today.
- What do you want from me?

497
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,380
Your life.

498
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,762
Dr. Light.

499
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,472
Oh, no. Go!

500
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,234
I've never killed anyone before.

501
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,069
But it's not murder
if it's your double, right?

502
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,366
Why are you doing this?

503
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:37,744
It's the only way that I can stay alive.
To become you. I'm sorry, Linda.

504
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,166
No!

505
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,509
- How is this possible?
- You couldn't understand.

506
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,298
Light!

507
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,469
Flash. I thought
I took care of you outside.

508
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,353
Please don't let go. I may trip.

509
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,531
Okay, I won't. I promise. Two more steps.

510
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,780
- All right. Missed one.
- There you go.

511
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:21,909
It's funny how we skipped
straight to the hand-holding part.

512
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:23,710
Yes.

513
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,585
Um... We've arrived at my car.

514
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,835
Ah.

515
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,756
Well, do you think we've reached
the goodnight-kiss stage?

516
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,176
Um...

517
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,195
Um...

518
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,826
This is burgundy, by the way,
and you look great in it.

519
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,281
Now, you can see?

520
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,494
Yeah, I can.

521
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,035
Well, that must have been some kiss.

522
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,582
I guess so.

523
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,257
- Sorry. Uh...
- No, it's mine, too.

524
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,628
Oh... Weird.

525
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,175
Cisco, hey.

526
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,720
Sir?

527
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,268
I saw myself.

528
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,432
How is that even possible?

529
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,348
It sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

530
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,191
And now Larkin's dead,

531
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,193
because someone who looks like me
wanted to kill me?

532
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,367
Linda, none of this is your fault.
We're gonna figure it all out. I promise.

533
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,660
How you doing?

534
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,330
I'm alive. Thanks to Iris.

535
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,417
Turns out she's as badass with a gun
as she is with a pen.

536
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:47,664
Yeah, she is.

537
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm just happy that you're safe.

538
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:51,923
I've arranged a security detail.
Round the clock, just to be sure.

539
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:53,758
I can take you to them if you're ready.

540
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,710
Yeah.

541
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,884
This is because of me.
I should have been here.

542
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,595
Barry, you were blind. There was
nothing that you could have done.

543
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,433
You think this mask
can help us find that woman?

544
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,936
Any evidence on this
is just gonna match Linda.

545
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,896
I'll think of something else.
Light's not gonna kill again.

546
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,401
- Caitlin, are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

547
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,578
Barry, I'm sorry.
Dr. Light's never killed before.

548
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:24,622
I thought we could reason with her.

549
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,326
You cannot reason
with someone under Zoom's influence.

550
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,913
And now a man is dead
because of you, Garrick.

551
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,839
This whole thing is because of you.
He doubts himself.

552
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,010
Because of you. But believe me,
Barry can do what you could not.

553
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,802
Barry can stop Zoom!

554
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,130
I spent two years hunting Zoom.

555
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,683
Wrong! Zoom hunted you.

556
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:48,434
You spent the last two years of your life
running, running, running from Zoom.

557
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:50,515
Look, Zoom would have killed me,
just like he will kill Barry

558
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,270
if you lead him down this path.

559
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,978
No, because he is not like you.

560
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,487
Barry runs towards danger, not from it.
Because Barry's not a coward.

561
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,751
Enough!

562
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,085
You were pretty hard
on Jay in there.

563
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,336
Maybe you should be hard on Jay, too.

564
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,013
I've seen what you can do, Barry.
I've calculated how fast you can run.

565
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,017
And you should be teaching Jay.
Not the other way around.

566
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,060
You know, before I learned

567
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,895
that the other Wells
was the man who murdered my mom,

568
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,984
I looked up to him.
He was my mentor, actually.

569
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:49,413
So, my doppelgangef,

570
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:53,496
A man who looks exactly like me,
betrayed you.

571
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,041
Hmm.

572
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:57,332
I'm sorry. I'm not him.

573
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:02,378
So you need to listen to me when I say
you can take care of Zoom.

574
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:06,307
And all we have to do
is capture Dr. Light.

575
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,432
I thought about testing the mask
for Light's DNA,

576
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,230
but it would only have Linda's.

577
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,978
The mask? What mask?

578
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,188
Light's mask.

579
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,483
How did you get this?

580
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,612
Iris shot it off Dr. Light
when she attacked Linda.

581
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,659
You know how to use the mask
to find Light?

582
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,160
Yes, I do.
All we have to do is give it to him.

583
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:31,282
- Why me?
- Because you have powers.

584
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,121
What are you talking about?

585
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,174
I developed this watch
to detect meta-humans.

586
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,641
You never got an alert on your phone.

587
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:54,852
You never reprogrammed
the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite.

588
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,565
And this is why.

589
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,106
He's a meta-human.

590
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,953
Cisco, have you known about this?
And you didn't say anything to us?

591
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,919
Yeah, I was going to tell you.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

592
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:19,167
I swear. I was, but I didn't.

593
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,134
I was just... I was afraid.

594
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,507
Afraid of what?

595
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,635
Dr. Wells said
the dark matter gave me this, this gift.

596
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,844
He said that one day I'd thank him for it.

597
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,138
What if I become like him?

598
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,733
Cisco, I don't think any of us
would become evil

599
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,982
if we all of a sudden got powers.
Even if they were from Dr. Wells.

600
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,066
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

601
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,819
I should have said something.
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

602
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,538
Well, you can be sorry later.

603
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,582
Because right now, we have to use
your powers to find Dr. Light.

604
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,707
Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?

605
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,540
Uh, I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

606
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,467
Visions of the breachers when
they come to this Earth.

607
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,389
I just... I'm not sure what triggers it.
And sometimes itjust happens.

608
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,340
Sometimes, it's when
I'm touching something of theirs.

609
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,599
Touch the mask.
You want to find Dr. Light, do it.

610
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,788
Hmm...

611
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,664
I don't think it's working.

612
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,996
Try again.

613
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,177
- Try again!
- Yo.

614
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,429
- I'm sorry. It's not...
- Again!

615
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,731
- I can't control it.
- Because you're afraid!

616
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm telling you, I don't know how it
works! I can't just make it happen!

617
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,442
I'm telling you, yes, you can!

618
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,954
South Plaza Train Station, Platform 15.

619
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,411
What are you waiting for?

620
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,963
Oh, guys, the platform's crowded.
Are you sure she's here?

621
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,971
She should be wearing a black trench coat.

622
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,719
Black trench coat. Found her.

623
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,601
Everybody, get out of here! Go! Go, hurry!

624
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,231
Why won't you just let me leave?

625
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,860
I can't let you leave.
You killed an innocent man.

626
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,157
That was an accident.

627
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,197
Trying to kill Linda Park wasn't.

628
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,030
It's the only way that I can be free
from Zoom. Unless I kill you.

629
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,208
Can't let you do that, either.
So, we've got a problem.

630
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:01,876
We'll see.

631
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,376
Guys? Should've talked about this
before I left, but how should I stop her?

632
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,458
Keep trying different angles, Barry.
Find her blind spot.

633
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,755
I can't get close enough.
What should I do?

634
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,929
I don't know.

635
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:20,181
Oh, I gotta tell you, that's not
exactly the answer I was looking for.

636
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,184
You need to confuse her.
Give her more than one target

637
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,016
so she does not know who to fire at.

638
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,476
All right. How do I do that?

639
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,733
By running so fast, you create
multiple afterimages of yourself.

640
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,157
You create a speed mirage.

641
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,985
Oh, speed... I've never run that fast!

642
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,907
Well, from what I've been told,
you've traveled through time.

643
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,989
You'll be more than fast enough.

644
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,536
Okay.

645
00:36:58,757 --> 00:36:59,929
Barry?

646
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,260
I can't do it!

647
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,688
Yes, you can, Barry.
Hey, Dr. Wells is right. You are fast.

648
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,186
Faster than I ever was,
and better than I ever will be.

649
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,644
Don't let fear and doubt hold you back,
like it did to me.

650
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,231
You're the Flash, Barry.
Show Light what that means.

651
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,503
Where are you?

652
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,876
I'm right here.

653
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,885
Dr. Light
is safely locked in the pipeline.

654
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,809
Nicely done.

655
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,686
Wells. Thank you for helping Barry
put away Dr. Light.

656
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,483
So. What now?

657
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,610
We do what Dr. Wells said.

658
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,065
We use her to lure Zoom here.
End this, once and for all.

659
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,489
You can't be serious.

660
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,239
More breachers are gonna come.
More innocent people may die.

661
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,367
I can't let this happen anymore.

662
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,414
Well, you're making a mistake, okay?

663
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,494
Zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

664
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,376
I've already had my worst nightmare.
His name was Reverse-Flash.

665
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,003
I spent a long time being afraid of him.

666
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,677
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

667
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,844
Okay, Barry,
you may be faster than me,

668
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,175
But you're not ready
to fight Zoom by yourself.

669
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:23,851
That's just it, Jay.

670
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,679
I'm not gonna fight him by myself.

671
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,766
I've got all of them to help me.
I've got Dr. Wells,

672
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,601
I've got you.

673
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,110
No. I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

674
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,286
it'll only lead to you losing your speed
or even worse,

675
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,954
your death.

676
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:45,202
Optimism must be an Earth-1 thing.

677
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,786
You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

678
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,836
wouldn't admit that he was responsible

679
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,507
for the particle accelerator
exploding underground.

680
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:57,835
He may not be
Harrison Wells from your Earth,

681
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,800
but he has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

682
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,094
Jay, please don't go.

683
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,063
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

684
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,157
Have a nice day. What can I get you.

685
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,454
Yeah, I know, this is supes awkward.
Probably, more for me than for you.

686
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,373
But I just want coffee. Okay?

687
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,293
Just three Flashes.
One of them decaf. That's it.

688
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:39,085
Are you sure that's all you want?

689
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,342
Oh, that's funny. You just want to
shoot me down again, huh?

690
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,385
No. No, no, no.

691
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,436
What I mean is,
I Just moved to Central City.

692
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,393
And it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

693
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,818
Everything here's so big and new,
and filled with meta-humans.

694
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:59,150
Yeah. Well, when you factor in
the size of the city,

695
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,608
the chances of running into a meta-human
are actually pretty low.

696
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,199
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

697
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,998
you kinda caught me
off guard the other day.

698
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:11,701
But now, I'm a little more prepared.

699
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,835
So I Just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

700
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,844
Hi. I'm Cisco Ramon.

701
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,347
Kendra Saunders. It's nice to meet you.

702
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,934
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I Just...

703
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,059
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

704
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,436
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

705
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,563
They always seem to show up
just when you need 'em.

706
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,228
Yo.

707
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,275
Peep that.

708
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,782
- That's how it's done, young Padawan.
- Wow. Nice.

709
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,030
We're going on a date next week.

710
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,695
Things are looking up for Cisco Ramon.

711
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,621
I guess so.
Still stuck with these powers, though.

712
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,244
I just don't know how to feel about them.

713
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,202
Hey, look, you don't gotta
go through it alone.

714
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,496
And now you need a cool name.

715
00:40:57,704 --> 00:41:00,298
Oh, snap. You're totally right.

716
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,592
Oh, I gotta think about this one.
Well, you know me. It's gotta be perfect.

717
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,844
- Mmm-hmm.
- Something that really sings, you know.

718
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,550
Something like...

719
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,351
"Vibe"?

720
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,224
Vibe.

721
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,106
Vibe.

722
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,039
Your father has abandoned you.

723
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,376
You're lying.
My father's the smartest man alive.

724
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:47,385
He'll find me. He'll save me.
And then he'll kill you.

725
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,931
I will not die.

726
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:57,273
What happens to you and your father
is still to be decided.
