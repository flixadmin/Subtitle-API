1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,920
On the count of three,
instead of telling me who you love

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,040
- tell me who to kill.
- Kill Lee.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,960
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,040
If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
Listen to me! I would never do
anything to hurt you.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
Kristin. No!

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,640
You wanted to save Lee.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,240
You knew he would do the opposite.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,200
You love Lee. Which means we're done.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,480
I have found someone.
I have no choice

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
- to confess my feelings to Ed.
- Duh!

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,880
Is this about the tests they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,480
Yes. The rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies. Violent rage.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,880
- I assume they're working on a cure.
- Yes, but it could take years.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Nobody moves!

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,520
- What is going on?
- I'm afraid your evening

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
- has been hijacked.
- Glasses down!

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,040
Is that my dear sister I see?

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,520
She's in you, isn't she?

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,360
- Miss Kringle?
- No, my name is Isabella.

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,080
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,560
I met someone. I think I'm in love.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,760
I want to re-join the GCPD.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Welcome back, detective.

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
GCPD! Hands in the air!

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Back away! Slowly.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
This ain't what it looks like.

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,120
Explain it to me
down at the precinct.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,720
For now, you'd be wise
to keep your mouth shut.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
Listen, can we talk about this?

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Be reasonable, man.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
Look, I didn't kill anybody. Okay?

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm the cleaner. That's it.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
- You're just the cleaner.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
You're just the guy
that chops up the bodies

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
and dumps them in a vat of acid.

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
That's it.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,640
What're you doing, man?

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Just take me in, okay?

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,760
I bet that's what you want.

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Me to read you your rights.

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,320
Make sure you get a lawyer.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
In two, three years from now,
I'll see you on some corner

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,280
free as a bird.

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,800
Any other night, yeah.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,760
It would eat at me,
but, yeah, I'd do it.

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
Not tonight.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,160
The Toad, he's the one you want!
He gave me the job!

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,280
See, something got into me.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
Now, I see a scumbag like you

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,200
and my blood starts boiling
in my veins.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,400
I just want to punish you.
Make you suffer.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,680
But until now,
I've been able to control it.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
But it's growing stronger
inside of me.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Please.

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,800
The Toad! I told you! He's the one!

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Just arrest me! Arrest me!

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,200
- We're past that.
- Please.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Morning.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
We knew what we were
getting into, right?

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,120
{\an5}When we agreed to let my dad
throw us an engagement party?

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,800
{\an5}- Oh, we knew.
- I mean, who are these people?

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,280
He's very proud of you.

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,160
{\an5}And he wants all of Gotham
to know that.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
{\an5}Well, he's succeeded because
he invited most of the city.

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,760
{\an5}- How are you so okay with this?
- Because I agree with him.

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
{\an5}He should be proud. As am I.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,720
How did I get so lucky?

70
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
{\an5}What is it?

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,360
Jim Gordon's returning to the GCPD.

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,880
{\an5}- When?
- He starts today.

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
{\an5}- How long have you known this?
- A few days.

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,560
{\an5}I'm sorry,
I should've told you sooner.

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,360
{\an5}It's fine.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,720
{\an5}Is it?

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
{\an5}I don't know, Lee.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,120
{\an5}We agreed
he wouldn't be a part of our lives

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
{\an5}and now you're going
to be working with him.

80
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,200
{\an5}- That's a part of our lives.
- Do you trust me?

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,360
{\an5}Because if you do,
then nothing else matters.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Of course, I trust you.

83
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
{\an5}And you're right, you're right.
It's all gonna be okay.

84
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
It's just...

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
{\an5}When I think about what happened
with Tetch.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
{\an5}And the things that Gordon said, I...

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,320
So don't think about it.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
{\an5}I'll try.

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,560
{\an5}But if you accidentally shot him,
I'd be okay with that, too.

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
{\an5}No promises.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,160
{\an5}I'll see you tonight.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Yeah.

93
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,760
- Lock this bummer.
- Shut up.

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
Come on!

95
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,000
Finish it at this moment!

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
There you are. We got a call.
Warehouse district.

98
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
You coming?

99
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,720
- That's it? No "welcome back?"
- Please.

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
If we had a big to do every time
you came back to the GCPD

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
we'd never catch any bad guys.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,280
Andale, partner.

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, and I believe this
belongs to you.

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
You coming or what?

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Yeah. I'm coming.

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,120
What must be broken
before it can be used?

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
- Eggs!
- Correct.

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,080
As always.

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Edward, you spoil me.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
You make it easy.

111
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm going to miss you.

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
I'm only gone for two days.

113
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,120
Actually, your conference ends
at 1:45 on Monday.

114
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,360
With traffic,
I put you in 5:30 in the Gotham.

115
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,480
If you leave on time today,
which I'm sure that you will...

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
you'll be gone 44 and one-half hours.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,760
Less than two days.

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
I will hold onto that thought.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,920
Cream! I'll got you cream.

120
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,800
So what does one do
at a librarian conference?

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, it would bore you.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,280
Nothing that you would say, do,
or think would bore me.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,400
In that case,
let me read you my schedule.

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,400
Where did those glasses come from?

125
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
These? These are my back-up pair.

126
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
I normally wear contacts.

127
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,160
I thought you knew that.

128
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Is something wrong?

129
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,280
Edward, what is it?

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
You look like you've seen a ghost.

131
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Excuse me.

132
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
They're just a pair of glasses.

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,760
I remember
you loved that style on me.

134
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh, dear.

135
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,080
I haven't upset you, have I, Ed?

136
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,560
I would've thought
you would've been used

137
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,120
to seeing people in mirrors.

138
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,560
You're just in my head.

139
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
Like that makes a difference.

140
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,360
But honestly, besides the fact
that she looks just like me

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,280
you went from someone
who files papers in a police station

142
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,280
to someone who files books
in a library.

143
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
Not super original.

144
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,840
You and Isabella are...

145
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
just somewhat, different.

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, I'm dead, and she's alive.

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,760
But how long will that last?

148
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,840
Until you...

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,200
I...

150
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,760
I would never hurt Isabella.

151
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,960
I bet you would've said
the same thing about me.

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,760
Face it, Ed. You're a killer.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,200
It's only a matter of time
before you...

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Okay, so, the UNI ID'd the Vic.

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,000
One Paulie Penopolus,
aka Paulie Pennies.

156
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
Clean up guy
for the Gotham underworld.

157
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Bingo. I'm thinking it's some
kind of business thing.

158
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,480
Maybe an unhappy customer?

159
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,960
- Perhaps a competitor.
- Good places to start.

160
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey listen, seriously, Jim,
I'm glad you're back.

161
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,160
Me too, Harv. Feels good.

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
This wasn't just business.

163
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
We should call Barnes.

164
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,920
You know why I'm here.

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, yes.

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes, indeed.

167
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,360
She's in there, isn't she?

168
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
Inside of you.

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Hello, sister dear.

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
Just tell me.

171
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
You grew up with your sister.

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,360
You've seen this virus first hand.

173
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,280
How do I beat it?

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
I believe the way this works
is you give me something

175
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
I give you something. Tick-tock.

176
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,320
How about I let you keep your teeth?

177
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Or...

178
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,320
My sister's virus
is a beautiful thing

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,920
it makes the darkest part
of a person sing.

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,040
What darkness in you
has Alice brought to life?

181
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Tell me that,
and I'll tell you everything I know.

182
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
Criminals.

183
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
The guilty.

184
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
My anger at them.

185
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,520
Oh, but it's not anger I see.

186
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
Rage.

187
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,280
Violent, bloody rage.

188
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,680
All right, Tetch, my turn.

189
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,720
Is there a cure?

190
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
Yes.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
There is a cure.

192
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,160
What is it?

193
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,080
You give in,
and let my dear sister win.

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,720
- You think I'm playing?
- Have you heard the voices?

195
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,320
What voices?

196
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,040
The virus, even as it grows stronger,
waxes and wanes

197
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,720
you may have the illusion
you're winning.

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
Then you hear the voices...

199
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,640
those dark voices
from deep within you

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,400
whispering, whispering.

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,240
And finally you'll see the world
as it really is.

202
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,120
And there'll be
no more Captain Barnes.

203
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Only Alice, my dear Alice.

204
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
You don't know me.

205
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
You've dirtied your hands,
haven't you?

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,760
And now you're desperately trying
to make it right.

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I can make it right.

208
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,760
You're back.

209
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
I'm back.

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
I suppose
it was only a matter of time.

211
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,440
Once a cop, always a cop.

212
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,320
For better or worse,
this is where I belong.

213
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,160
- How's Vale?
- Good. I think.

214
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
She was on a hospital anyway.

215
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
- You two are not...
- No.

216
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm not trying to make this awkward.

217
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Why would it be?
We're both adults.

218
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,400
There's no reason
we can't work together.

219
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm glad you feel that way.

220
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,360
Mario agrees?

221
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
He will. Eventually.

222
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,920
Right.

223
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
Our engagement party is tonight.

224
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,440
I'll only bring it up
because a few people here are going.

225
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
- It's awkward now, isn't it?
- A little.

226
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,880
So you want to know
about the two bodies

227
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
- that you found this morning?
- Yes.

228
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,440
I've only had time
to do a preliminary examination.

229
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,360
But that John Doe in the acid?

230
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,560
His face had been removed.

231
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,200
- Removed how?
- Scalpel? Razorblade?

232
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Whoever did it knew exactly
what they were doing.

233
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,880
I'll have more for you soon.

234
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,320
Jim...

235
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,160
I think you made the right decision,
coming back.

236
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,720
I noticed there was exactly,
was just business

237
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,120
but, right now, we're thinking
whoever paid Paulie Pennies

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,920
to dispose of the body in the bathtub

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,320
then also might have killed him
to tie up loose ends.

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Uh-huh.

241
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,320
Jim, good to see you
with a shield again.

242
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,240
- And a tie.
- Captain, good to be back.

243
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,800
Bullock was just filling me in.

244
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Hell of one a catch
in your first day.

245
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Yeah.

246
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
It's the preliminary report from Lee.

247
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,000
John Doe had had his face removed.

248
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
- Trying to cover up his identity?
- I don't know, maybe.

249
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,360
But the acid would've done
that anyway.

250
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm gonna run point on this one.

251
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,960
- Honestly, cap...
- That's cool.

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
Look, I know I've been away...

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Maybe that's why you forgot
how things go around here.

254
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,760
I give you an order,
and you follow it.

255
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,320
Which for the record, Captain,
I totally support.

256
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm taking point on this.
Not giving you the day off.

257
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,080
File the physical evidence,
Bullock. Report back to me.

258
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,360
Aye-aye.

259
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,320
Jim.

260
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

261
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,360
Just sometimes the ugliness here
gets to me.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
No need to explain.

263
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
Let me know if you need anything.

264
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,440
And...

265
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,080
don't let those bastards
haze you too hard, rookie.

266
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,040
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Gordon.

268
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,200
Here's one you wanted, Captain.
Mid-level felon.

269
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,120
- Goes by "The Toad?"
- Yeah, that's him.

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,560
Thank you.

271
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Maybe she's right?

272
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,040
What if there's something
about Miss Kringle

273
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Kristen's, Isabella's face

274
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,360
what if there's something
about her face that

275
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,160
unlocks that side of me?

276
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,080
What if I do hurt her?

277
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,440
Oswald?

278
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,040
- Yes?
- You're smiling.

279
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,680
- I was?
- Yes.

280
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Well...

281
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,600
I was just thinking...

282
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,120
how darned lucky Isabella is.

283
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,360
You love her, yet to protect her

284
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
you're willing to break up with her.

285
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
Beautiful.

286
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,160
Sad, but beautiful.

287
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
So you think I should break up
with her.

288
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm sorry. I thought that's
what we were talking about.

289
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
Certainly,
I would never pressure you...

290
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,040
No, you're right.

291
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
If I did hurt her,
I would never forgive myself.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
That life would put her
in your path again

293
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,720
only to snatch her from you.

294
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,640
- Why?
- I can't do it.

295
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,280
- What?
- I can't break up with her.

296
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,400
- But, you said yourself...
- I need you to do it for me.

297
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
Would you do that?

298
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I would be forever in your debt.

299
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,960
Just be gentle.

300
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
Of course.

301
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm looking for a punk

302
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,040
who's supposedly frequent
this rat hole.

303
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
Goes by "The Toad."

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Who's asking?

305
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,360
Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,360
How about you and I go on
to the precinct

307
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,160
and you can answer some questions.

308
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,880
Blow, pig.

309
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,120
I want to know about Paulie Pennies.

310
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,000
The body he was getting
rid of last night.

311
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,280
Where'd it come from?

312
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,040
Maybe you want me
to open up that mouth for you.

313
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
Stop!

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm... I hired Paulie!

315
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
But I'm just the go-between!

316
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm getting so sick of hearing that.

317
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,440
Nobody's responsible for anything.

318
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,480
Everyone's a middle man.
I want a name!

319
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,840
Symon. Okay?

320
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,320
Dr. Symon.

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,520
He's a big-time plastic surgeon!

322
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,240
So what?

323
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,240
He likes cutting people's
faces off for kicks? Try again.

324
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,040
No! He's got a side business.

325
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
You get in trouble.
You need a new face.

326
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,760
He gives you one!

327
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,800
New face? Whose?

328
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,040
I don't know. I just get rid
of the bodies that's all!

329
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,400
You think you're not guilty,
but you are.

330
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,000
Stop. Stop it, Symon!

331
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,240
He's the one you want!

332
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
You're a cop!

333
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,840
Symon?

334
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
Take me to him.

335
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,560
Mayor Cobblepot?

336
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,960
Hello, Isabella.

337
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
May I?

338
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
Of course.

339
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
Going somewhere?

340
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,960
Just for a couple nights.

341
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,040
But, I was hoping to talk to Ed
before I left.

342
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,640
I've tried calling him. Is he okay?

343
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes.

344
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,680
How shall I put this?

345
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
It's over.

346
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Excuse me?

347
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
He's not going to see you anymore.

348
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,400
Don't try to contact him.

349
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,240
That door is closed.

350
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,800
Have a nice life.

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,560
Oh, my.

352
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,160
It's a shock.

353
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,440
But really, besides your odd
resemblance to his ex

354
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,320
a certain facility with riddles

355
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,040
compulsion for order

356
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
what is it that you two
really have in common?

357
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,480
Edward is a person
of exceptional intelligence

358
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,960
and imagination.

359
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,400
He deserves to be appreciated
by someone on his own level.

360
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,080
And you, my dear, are simply not.

361
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
Best end things now.

362
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,960
You're right.

363
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,720
I don't deserve him.

364
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,320
Glad we agree. Bye.

365
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
But I'm not going to let him go.

366
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,880
He loves me, and I love him.

367
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,360
Do you know how rare that is,
Mr. Mayor?

368
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Of course, you do

369
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,360
because you love him too.

370
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,520
I can see it.

371
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,880
I'm not even jealous.

372
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,560
I don't think you understand

373
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
It was my glasses this morning.

374
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
They reminded him of Miss Kringle.

375
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,600
He's afraid he's going to hurt me
like he hurt her.

376
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
Listen to me, you little idiot

377
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm telling you one last time

378
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,480
Let. Ed. Go.

379
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
No.

380
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,480
I'll write to him.

381
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll make him understand
he has nothing to fear.

382
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,640
I'm not gonna let him go.

383
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,760
Very well.

384
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
Don't say I didn't warn you.

385
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,720
You better not have been lying to me.

386
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm not! This is his place.

387
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

388
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm trying.

389
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm about to take the face.

390
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,160
Be here in an hour,
and we can do the transplant

391
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
you haven't eaten today, have you?

392
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,600
Very good.

393
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I have to thank you, my dear
for taking such care of your skin.

394
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,840
Excellent elasticity.

395
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,400
Now hold still.

396
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Who's there?

397
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,200
Quiet.

398
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,320
Or we will forgo any anesthesia.

399
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,160
- I said, who's there?
- GCPD.

400
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
You're under arrest.

401
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
Go for it.

402
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,880
Please.

403
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,120
I surrender.

404
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Ma'am?

405
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
You all right?

406
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,600
How many?

407
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,320
- Excuse me?
- How many have you killed?

408
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,320
How many faces have you taken?

409
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,800
I have the right to an attorney.

410
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,440
I wish to invoke that right now.

411
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,560
<i>Guilty! Guilty!</i>

412
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,680
Who's there?

413
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,560
No one. It's only me.

414
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,040
<i>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!</i>

415
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,560
What is wrong with you?

416
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,520
What are you doing? Arrest me!

417
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,040
<i>Guilty! Guilty!</i>

418
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
I am not resisting!

419
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
<i>Guilty!</i>

420
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,680
The point Dr. Thompkins hopes
you pay particular attention to

421
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,200
is the level of strength required
to sever Paulie Pennies' head

422
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,880
from his torso.

423
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,040
And what level would that be, Lucius?

424
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,040
- Extreme.
- Extreme strength, got it.

425
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,240
As with the other victim
in the bathtub

426
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
we haven't gotten any hits
on his prints

427
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,840
but a puncture mark in his arm
suggests he was drugged

428
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,800
prior to having his face removed.

429
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,880
I'll run toxicology,
let you know what I come up with.

430
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
- Thanks, Lucius.
- Yep.

431
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
It's good to have you back, Gordon.

432
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,760
Lucius, you're in forensics,
not the M.E.

433
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Is there a reason
Lee didn't bring this herself?

434
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
Dr. Thompkins has already gone
for today.

435
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
Her engagement party?

436
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Right.

437
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,640
I heard it's gonna be
quite the affair.

438
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,200
Beautiful women.
Free booze. Canapes.

439
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,000
- Harvey, you can go if you want.
- What? No.

440
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,640
I'd much rather spend time
here with my old partner.

441
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
Much more fun.

442
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,120
Besides, I wasn't invited.

443
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Captain!

444
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,960
Bullock, book this piece
of human garbage

445
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,680
for the murder of the John Doe.

446
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
You got it, Captain, come on.

447
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,320
He's a plastic surgeon.

448
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,520
Face man for the underworld.

449
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,680
He had a girl on the table.

450
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,920
If I'd been there five minutes
later...

451
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
But you weren't.

452
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,240
You did it, Captain.

453
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah. Today.

454
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,360
You know the feeling, Jim,
when you've won a battle

455
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,760
but know you're going
to lose the war?

456
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,600
Wars are fought one battle
at a time, sir.

457
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,200
You said he killed the John Doe.

458
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,000
Not Paulie Pennies?

459
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,560
No. His killer is still out there.

460
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,600
I'll get him tomorrow. I promise.

461
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,720
My father and I have not always
seen eye-to-eye

462
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,160
but I think, Dad, will agree of that

463
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,560
marrying Lee is the best decision
I've ever made.

464
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,120
Without a doubt.

465
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,360
And Lee, you're a doctor

466
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,360
a member of our city's
police department

467
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,400
you're funny,
compassionate and brilliant

468
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
despite insisting all dogs are boys

469
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,800
and all cats are girls

470
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,800
It's hopeless,
I've tried to correct her.

471
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,960
I loved you since the moment
I saw you.

472
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,960
You're so wonderful. He's sweet.

473
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,240
- You're so lucky.
- Lee!

474
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,720
Congrats.

475
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,320
You look gorgeous, no surprise.

476
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,840
- Barbara? How did you...
- Get in?

477
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,200
As a plus one.

478
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,040
With that guy there. Hey.

479
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,520
- Or it might've been him.
- You need to leave right now.

480
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,400
Can't we bury the hatchet?

481
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,400
So I came at you with a knife,
kidnapped you, whatever.

482
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,760
I've forgiven you
for beating me unconscious.

483
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,960
Water under the bridge.

484
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,360
You just stay right here.
I'm gonna get someone.

485
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm leaving.

486
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,160
I just wanted to ask.

487
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,000
As someone else
who was once with Jim Gordon

488
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,720
- don't you miss it?
- Miss what.

489
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,440
The heat.

490
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,640
Being so close,
so much darkness and light.

491
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
To someone always a warm in himself.

492
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,040
Let me think.
Tormented Jim Gordon.

493
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Or Mario, who I know is a good man.

494
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,400
Who'll be a wonderful father
to my children.

495
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920
And whom I love.

496
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,560
No, I don't miss it.

497
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,560
Wow.
I think you actually believe that.

498
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,720
It's kind of sad.

499
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Tell my dates I've left, would you?

500
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,560
Don't let her ruin your night.

501
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,720
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

502
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,760
I can't stay.
I came to congratulate you.

503
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
You deserve to be happy.

504
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,520
Thank you.

505
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,240
But you have to stay
for at least one drink.

506
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,840
If nothing else to save me
from these people.

507
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,560
One drink.

508
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,600
- But no work talk.
- Deal.

509
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,720
So among the materials
confiscated in Symon's lab

510
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,760
I came across a unique
anesthetic cocktail.

511
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,280
Let me guess,
the same cocktail toxicology

512
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,760
- found in the John Doe.
- Exactly.

513
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,040
Hey. I got some bad news.

514
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,400
Symon walked.

515
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,320
- What?
- The girl he had tied up

516
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,960
refused to press charges
they've probably paid her off

517
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,680
and we just got an order
from Judge Bam-Bam

518
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,040
demanding his immediate release.

519
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,840
The botoxed son of a bitch
is uber-connected.

520
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,360
The toxicology definitely Ties Symon
to the John Doe murder.

521
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,680
We gotta get him back here.

522
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,080
Captain Barnes?

523
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Carmine Falcone.
I don't believe we've met.

524
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,840
No. But I was just leaving.

525
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,080
I see. Is my company so odious?

526
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,600
You belong behind bars.

527
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm retired.

528
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
After running Gotham's underworld
for 30 years.

529
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,880
This city was built
because of men like me.

530
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,360
People have jobs
because of men like me.

531
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,120
That whiskey you're drinking,
paid for through my work.

532
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,680
So you did some good, so what.

533
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,120
Doesn't mean you're above the law.

534
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,640
Nobody is.

535
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,040
You know, whenever I hear a man
possessed of such certainty

536
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,400
I always think he's trying mostly
to convince himself.

537
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,600
I wish you a pleasant evening,
Captain.

538
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,400
<i>- Me, Captain.</i>
- Alvarez?

539
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
Tell Gordon I'm bringing him the man

540
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,400
responsible for Paulie Pennies'
murder.

541
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,320
No backup.

542
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
He's coming in of his own accord.

543
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,520
<i>Sure thing Captain,
but you should know</i>

544
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,520
<i>the judge release Dr. Symon...</i>

545
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,280
<i>Guilty!</i>

546
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,720
<i>Guilty!</i>

547
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,080
<i>Guilty!</i>

548
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,680
<i>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!</i>

549
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
<i>Guilty.</i>

550
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Isabella?

551
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,560
Isabella, I got your note.

552
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
I thought you needed to leave
for your conference.

553
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,440
I can be late, Edward.

554
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,520
This is more important.

555
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,760
Oswald...

556
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,640
Oswald, the Mayor,
he informed me of your position.

557
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,760
But believe me, I think...

558
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,560
our breaking up is for the best.

559
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,520
No, Edward, it's not.

560
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,600
I understand your fear.

561
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,920
It comes from a place of love.

562
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,160
I know you won't hurt me.

563
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,480
You never could.

564
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,640
I don't think that you...

565
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,240
Oh, my...

566
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,120
Kristin...

567
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
I found old photos in newspapers.

568
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
- You have to, No, no, no.
- I need to leave. Now.

569
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,200
No, look at me. Look at me.

570
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,480
You don't know what you're doing.

571
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,240
I'm forcing you to face your fear!

572
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,680
You won't hurt me!

573
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Even when I look like this!
Edward!

574
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,080
Edward...

575
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Don't. No, no, don't, don't, no.

576
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,720
Edward...

577
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,040
Should I take the glasses off?

578
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,600
Keep them on.

579
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Seal off the exits.
But do it quietly.

580
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
Last thing anyone wants is a scene.

581
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,360
- Yes, sir.
- A little late for that.

582
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,880
What are you doing here?

583
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
I'm sorry,
but we have to make an arrest

584
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
in the Paulie Pennies case.

585
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,560
We tried to get the guy at his home.

586
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,000
But his housekeeper said he was here.

587
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,480
Just makes you realize what a small
town Gotham is, doesn't it?

588
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,920
Couldn't you wait?

589
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,680
If he's here,
he's not exactly running.

590
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,440
Which make a good point, Jim.
You wanna take that one?

591
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,680
Good evening, everyone.

592
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Jim.

593
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
- What's going on?
- Apparently,

594
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,080
there's a murder suspect
among our guests.

595
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,280
Can I ask who?

596
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,560
- Dr. Maxwell Symon. He's...
- A plastic surgeon.

597
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,440
You arrest him, you gonna have
to fight off every women here.

598
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,640
He's a favorite.

599
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,360
He's also a murderer.

600
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,560
I'd be curious to know
how your father knows him.

601
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm sure that their relationship
is completely above board.

602
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,400
While you two hash this out.
I'm gonna go and grab Symon.

603
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
- Harvey.
- What?

604
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,200
I can handle a plastic surgeon
on my own.

605
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,520
Don't worry,
discretion is my middle name.

606
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,560
Lee. I'd like a word with Jim.

607
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,520
- Mario...
- It'll be fine.

608
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Okay.

609
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,440
Look, Mario, I have a job to do,
so whatever this is...

610
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,400
When you told Tetch to kill Lee

611
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,360
you knew he would do the opposite.

612
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,720
You sacrificed your girlfriend

613
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,560
- for my fiancé.
- That's insane.

614
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,360
Would you just admit
you still love her?

615
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,160
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.

616
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,000
You once told me that
if I ever hurt Lee, you'd kill me.

617
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,760
Well now it's my turn.

618
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,240
I love Lee and I'll do whatever
I have to, to keep her.

619
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,400
Then word of advice,
lose the jealousy.

620
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,800
It's weak.

621
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
Gordon!

622
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
For Lee, I'll give you that one.

623
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Oh, Captain,
if you keep frowning like that

624
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,160
you'll never get those wrinkles
out around your mouth.

625
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,640
Come down to my office tomorrow,

626
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,240
I'll give you a free evaluation.

627
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,840
How surprised you can even feel that?

628
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
Through that thing you call a face.

629
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,280
What are you doing?

630
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,240
What I should have done all along.

631
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
You're insane.

632
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,160
Oh no, Doc,
I'm saner than I've ever been.

633
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,120
I'm seeing things clearly
for the very first time.

634
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,640
All these years,
I've put my trust in the system

635
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,400
my trust in the law

636
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
held myself back from doing
what I really wanted to do.

637
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,440
And then I saw the truth.
It's not just you that's guilty.

638
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
This whole city is guilty.

639
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,360
Stop!

640
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,600
You're a police officer
for god's sake!

641
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,400
You have to follow the law!

642
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,960
I don't have to do anything.
I am the law. I am judge...

643
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,320
jury...

644
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,360
and executioner!

645
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,760
Sentence served.

646
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Ed!

647
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,040
- How'd she take it?
- What?

648
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,040
Everything is wonderful.

649
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,520
Isabella showed me
that I was worried over nothing.

650
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm so happy for you.

651
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,680
But why are you back?

652
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,440
Well, she had to go
to her conference. I insisted.

653
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,240
You're a good man.
But you look done in.

654
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,280
I will hear all about it tomorrow.

655
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,880
Get some sleep.

656
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,680
You got to give her credit.
She fought for him.

657
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Too bad she underestimated
her opponent.

658
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,880
- I'm assuming it's done.
- Yup.

659
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,320
Feel kind of bad though, boss.

660
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
I always liked librarians.

661
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,040
You?

662
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,120
What about poor Ed?

663
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,520
He'll be heartbroken.

664
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,880
Luckily, he has a shoulder to cry on.

665
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,560
Come on. Oh, no.

666
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, come on.

667
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,640
Come on, come on, come on.

668
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,920
Help me! Help me! Somebody, help!
Oh, dear.

669
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,120
Jim, you and Mario
have a heart-to-heart?

670
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,480
Yeah. Where's Symon?

671
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,160
No luck. He must have skedaddled.

672
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,440
I thought he might be at the bar.

673
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,080
Look, keep a perimeter
in case he shows back up.

674
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm gonna head to his house.

675
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,920
And Harvey, take it easy.

676
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's good to have you back again,
Jim.

677
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm really glad.

678
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,160
- Captain, did you hear?
- Everything.

679
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,280
I saw Symon here earlier.

680
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,040
- You managed to pick him up?
- Not yet.

681
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,640
He must've skipped out
when we showed up. We'll get him.

682
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,680
Alvarez said you were bringing in
the guy who did Paulie Pennies?

683
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,000
Turns out to be a dead end.

684
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,960
I'll let you know when I find Symon.

685
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,120
Jim.

686
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,240
Things are going to change
around here.

687
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,400
You and I are gonna make
a difference in this city.

688
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,920
We're gonna clean it up.

689
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
Yes, sir.

690
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,920
<i>Guilty, guilty, guilty.</i>

691
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,960
<i>Guilty.</i>

692
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,960
<i>Guilty, guilty.</i>

693
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,560
- GCPD!
- Sir!

694
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
Dr. Symon.

695
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Who did this?

696
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,240
Barnes.
