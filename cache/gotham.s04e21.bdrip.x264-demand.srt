<i>GORDON: You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.</i>

<i>LEE: We all have our flaws.</i>

00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,993
But you're still breaking the law.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,239
Jerome uses distractions.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,390
Got a plan for that?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,035
Bruce?

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,269
Jeremiah?

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,955
Oh, God, no. He's still alive.

00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,279

20

Ijust got off the phone
with Search and Rescue,

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,432
whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker
was catastrophic.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,669
There are no signs of life.

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,800
Tell them to keep looking.

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,952
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen, Jim found his way out.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,075
Understand?

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,656
<i>Gotham City Police Department has

Listen, in two minutes,

39
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,677
Jim Garden's gonna come
walking through that door

40

and chew all your asses out

41

Now, first responders are on the scene,

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,317
I want CSis out there pronto.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,439
And I want everyone looking for
Jeremiah Valeska and Bruce Wayne.

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
That's who Jim was looking for
when this whole thing went blooey.

46
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,336
- You ain't the captain.
- The captain ain't here.

47

Last time <i>we</i> followed you,

AII right, look, enough.
Jim trusts him, okay?

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,754
So, everybody get back to work.

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,435
ALVAREZ: Harvey.

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,234
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't inside
the bunker when it blew.

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,589
How do you know?

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
'Cause he's outside,
and he's not alone.

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,430
What the hell?

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,479
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers as I've given them

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,789
something of a makeover.

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,032
But I assure you they're as loyal
to me as they ever were to him.

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,435
More so, 'cause I accomplished
something my brother never could.

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,959
Killing James Gordon.

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,395
- ALL: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
- You're a liar.

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,916
Not so fast.

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,717
I have bombs planted around this city.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,713
Just like the one
that killed Jim Gordon.

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,030
ALL: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,552
AII you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,837
Gotham's blown back to the Stone Age.

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,759
If I pull this trigger,

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,992
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,309
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,630
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,155
except mine is a bit more advanced.

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,358
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,673
and then boom, boom, boom.

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,078
Boom.

76
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,958
Now, if you won't do what I say...

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,400
- You're more sick than your brother.
- (CHUCKLES)

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,755
Don't compare me to that
shortsighted psychopath.

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,798
He just wanted to destroy things.

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,951
Me, I'm a builder.

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm going to create
a new Gotham in my image.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,630
But every artist
needs a blank canvas.

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,989
S0, all of this has to go.

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,830
I detonate the explosives
in six hours,

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,718
I want this city empty when I do.

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,198
You need us to evacuate Gotham
in six hours? That's impossible.

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,191
Then everyone who dies screaming.

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
Who watches their loved ones
crushed before them

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,356
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,034
Look,

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,111
nobody has to die.

92
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,471
Well, except for these people.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,918
I know seeing is believing,
and I do want you to believe me.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,115
So...

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
(BEEPING)

- (CAR ALARM BLARING)

98
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,353
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,719
Six hours, Detective.

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,235
The clock is ticking.

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,315
BARBARA: Shame. I liked the clock tower.

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,350
Jim took me there on a date once.
Now they're both up in smoke.

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,634
Good riddance.

104
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,678
He always did want to die a hero.

105
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,910
PENGUIN: And that was Jim's problem.

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,429
Me, I'd rather live.

107
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,399
And live well.

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
(SCOFFS) If it isn't little Penguin.

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,078
Oh, and Butch's corpse.

110
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,640
- Hey, Tabby.
- Butch.

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,674
The man responsible for the recent
fireworks is Jeremiah Valeska.

112
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,718
Twin brother of our old associate.

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,594
He has plans for Gotham.

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,111
Plans we learned about,
courtesy of this gentleman.

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,795
- They ripped out my fingernails.
- (LAUGHS)

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,111
I believe that this is a golden
opportunity for cash and glory.

117
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,672
Normally, Iwould keep
both of them for myself.

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,516
But I find myself a bit short
of the necessary manpower.

119
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,676
- Or woman-power, if you will.
- Hmm.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,311
I'II go 50/50 on the take.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,958
An alliance with you. I'Il pass.

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,750
Pity. With the money
we were going to make,

123
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,719
I'd hoped to finally be able to
cure Butch of his condition.

124
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,429
Wait, what do you mean?

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,353
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,913
Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,914
Hugo Strange can fix Butch,
but it won't be cheap.

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,029
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,034
Don't look at me like that.

130
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,590
I almost got killed fighting
your ex-boyfriend's rotting corpse.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,320
I think it's time to return the favor.

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,035
Fine.

133
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,312
But swamp boy keeps his funk
ten feet from me at all times.

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,232
What did you have in mind?

135
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,595
Evacuate this city in six hours?

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,637
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,832
because this maniac has
bombs hidden all over Gotham.

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,513
Think of how many lives are at stake.

139
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,270
And every minute you hesitate
means fewer people get to safety.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,991
- We'II need police.
- We are police!

141
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,357
We're here to help. Harper,
please, will you help the mayor?

142
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,834
HARPER: You got it.

143
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,673
Holy Mother of God. Bruce Wayne.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey.

145
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,474
Bruce, are you okay?

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,358
I'm fine. I heard about Jim.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,936
- Is it true?
- As far as I'm concerned,

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,395
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,
and waiting for us to iind him.

149
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,074
Detective, don't lie to me.

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,720
It's not looking good, kid.

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
I was hoping you could help me.

152
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,631
Did you see Jim?
How did you get out of the bunker?

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,256
Jeremiah and I had
already left the bunker.

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,079
Jerome sprayed him with a gas
that drove him insane.

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,798
I'm so sick of that freaking family.

156
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,838
Did you hear about
Gotham Clock Tower? Huh?

157
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,752
This guy's got these massive...

158
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,956
- It's my fault.
- What?

159
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,959
Jeremiah had plans to create
next-generation generators.

160
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Ifunded him.

161
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,320
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?

162
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,514
Listen,

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,696
the schematics for the battery

164
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,518
should be in the Wayne Enterprises
R&D lab.

165
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,576
Lucius can take a look at them and
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,416
- I'm going to go get them now.
- No, you're going home.

167
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,616
- No, I have to do this.
- (SHOUTS) Look, I know you feel guilty,

168
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,713
but Jim Gordon was...
Is important to all of us.

169
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,237
And it's my job. S0. go home,
be with Alfred, be safe.

170
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,038
It's what Jim would want.

171
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
Lucius.

- (SIGHS)
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

173
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,189
Alfred, where have you been?

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,072
<i>JEREMIAH: No, notAlfred.</i>

175
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,199
I hope you didn't
catch a cold in my brothers grave.

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,398
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

177
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
What have you done? Where's Alfred?

178
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,995
Such anger.

179
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,119
Some people, not me, of course,

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,272
might consider that ingratitude
considering all I've done for you.

181
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,476
<i>AII I'm still doing for you.</i>

182
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
You mean lying to me?

183
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,555
Using my company to build bombs?
Trying to kill me?

184
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,513
Bruce, let's get something straight.

185
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,076
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,038
I'd have put a bullet through your brain

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,316
and left you to rot in that grave.

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,274
But I meant what I said.

189
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,555
You're my best friend. And today,
I'm going to prove it to you.

190
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,874
You are insane.
And you killed Jim Gordon.

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,470
<i>And if you don't want
your man-servant to die, too,</i>

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,756
<i>you will follow
my instructions to the letter.</i>

193
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,511
71 Welling Avenue,
be there in an hour.

194
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,238
Tell the police and I'II know.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
Just like I know
that's where you are right now.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,354
(GROANS)

197
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Well, well,

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,392
Jim Gordon, back from the dead.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,195
Where am I?

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,270
The Narrows.

201
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,716
I was in Jeremiah's bunker.
There was a bomb.

202
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,074
Ed had you followed.

203
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,471
His people found you after the blast.

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,676
I'II have to thank him
when I arrest him.

205
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,834
I'm surprised you didn't kill me.

206
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,872
I am, too, actually.

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
What do you plan to do with me?

208
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,354
I don't really know.

209
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,519
Lee, I have to get back to the GCPD.

210

Jerome's brother Jeremiahu

211
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,437
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

212
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,433
The city's being evacuated.

213
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,793
I have to... (GROANS)

214
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Ifsjust a painkiller.

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,195
Does make you easier to handle.
You're not going anywhere.

216
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,879
Myjacket... In myjacket.

217
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,997
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

218
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,956
They may give us
some clue as to what he's planning.

219
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,271
Please, let me take them to Harvey.

220
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,432
Oh, Jim, you still think you're
the only one who can save this city.

221
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,598
- Wait.
- Get some rest.

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,398
Doctor's orders.

223
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,192
(DOOR LOCK RATTLING)

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,356
Jeremiah's followers must have taken
Alfred while Iwas at the cemetery.

225
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,955
I bet he put up a fight.

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,758
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

227
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,638
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

228
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,536
I know it's asking a lot.
So I just really appreciate...

229
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,837
Bruce, I'm going to be here
whenever you need me.

230
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,878
Okay. that's the address.

231
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,119
I don't see anyone though.
That could be a trap, right?

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I don't know.

233
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,296
Jeremiah could have killed me
at the Cemetery.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,833
He wants something out of me.

235
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,797
Like what? To be your best friend?

236
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,989
Trap or not, if Alfred's in there,
I need to find out.

237
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,919
BRUCE: Alfred?

242
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,951
You want to help Jim Gordon?
Have you lost your mind?

243
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,536
You brought him here because
you thought it would give us leverage

244
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,757
- with the GCPD.
- Yes, by holding him hostage.

245
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,480
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

246
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,110
We solve it, and we trade
the information for clemency.

247
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,520
Perhaps.

248
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,470
Or, perhaps there's
something more going on.

(SIGHS)

250

What happened between Jim and I is over.

251
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,070
I'm trying to protect
what we've built.

252
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,874
I still like my plan better.

253
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,917
Ed, if this maniac
levels half the city,

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,436
it's going to disrupt food
distribution, water supply, power.

255
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,477
The people of The Narrows
will suffer the most.

256
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,870
We can prevent that,
while at the same time

257
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,474
helping us out of this mess we're in.

258
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Please.

259
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Fine.

260
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,073
If this is what you want,

261
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,075
I will do it.

262
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,914
For you.

263
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,390
Do it for us.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600

Look, we're talking about evacuating
hospitals, nursing homes, jails.

270
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,736
Some people just don't want to leave.

271

<i>We are seeing
the same levels of panic</i>

<i>on every bridge
and tunnel out of Gotham.</i>

273
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,072
God, what a mess.
Just make it happen.

274
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,390
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

275
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,760
LUCIUS: I got the schematics from
Wayne Enterprises R&D.

276
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,990
The Wayne kid said
the bombs were batteries.

277
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,720
A series of network
self-perpetuating generators.

278
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,110
But when Supercharged,
they contain enough energy

279
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,235
to level a city block.

280
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,879
Got it, battery bombs from hell.

281
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,474
Just tell me this will
help us find and disable them.

282
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Disable. yes. Find, no. But...

283
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,918
Look. Look here. Because they were
created to be networked together,

284
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,656
Jeremiah would have to send a signal.

285
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,149
A centrally-located core relay
in order to blow all the bombs

286
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,039
- from a single detonator.
- Lucius, just English, please.

287
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,873
Sorry, the bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,799
The core relay is the brain.
We find that, we destroy that.

289
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,433
We can stop the bombs from going off.

290
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,636
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

291
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,996
How do we find this brain?

292
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,119
Oh, Bruce. you are about to have
a very transformative experience.

293
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,359
I envy you.

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,229
Call our friends.

295
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,112
Tell them to kill the butler.
He is no longer necessary.

296
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,198
Oswald Cobblepot.

297
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,914
Barbara Kean.

298
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,918
In my stronghold.

299
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,316
Not one step closer. Mr. Valeska.

300
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,633
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

301
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,438
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

302
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,717
- PENGUIN: Indeed, it is.
- (SHUDDERING)

303
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Huh.

304
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,356
Well, it seems you have
the upper hand.

305
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,393
Undoubtedly.

306
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,109
And now,

307
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,471
we have our own demands.

308
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,311
$50 million. That's what you want?

309
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,194
It's a nice, round number.

310
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,110
I don't quite have that
on me right now.

311
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,397
You gave the mayor
six hours to evacuate Gotham.

312
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,998
An impossible task.

313
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,596
Let him buy another hour.
He will save thousands of lives.

314
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,078
$50 million will seem cheap.

315
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,597
I see. I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

316
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,713
I get you the money,
you give me back my core relay.

After knowing your brother.

320
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,673

Yes, really.

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,354
50 million, unmarked bills.

Of course not.

<i>we</i> kill Jeremiah and his people.

Thank you, gentlemen.

I want to make one thing very clear.

If Gotham becomes a rock pile.
I mind zero percent.

Fine, whatever.

Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.
It's almost convincing.

Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening
to destroy half the city.

You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

into thinking
you and Lee are a couple?

391

You see?

392
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,629
That is my point.

393
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,376
You don't believe that
Lee could actually love me, do you?

394
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,710
Honestly? No.

395
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,875
Hmm.

396
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,758
You're a psychopath and a murderer.

397
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,874
And the fact that you need me
to validate your crazy fantasy

398
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,519
means that
you don't believe it either.

That doesn't matter.

400

from killing thousands of people.

Here, I make the rules.

406
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
So, we're not going to do this

407
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,136
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

408
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,913
Lee's changed. I accept that.

409
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,672
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew. Fine.

410
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,639
- But she is not who you think she is.
- (SCOFFS)

411
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,553
The fact that she is with you
in whatever way she's with you...

412
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,032
[Oh, Jim, she's with me in even] way.

413
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,676
Means that
she wants something from you.

414
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,799
So, when it's done,
she'II get rid of you.

415
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,480
So, you're saying that she
wouldn't be with a killer and yet.

416
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,394
She was with you.

417
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,516
And you, Jim, are 10 times
the killer that I ever was.

418
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,955
You have a point.

419
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,198
Maybe that's why she's not with me now.

420
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,835
Can we do this?

421
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Why not?

422
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,351
Just try to keep up.
I'II speak slowly.

423
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,110
So most labyrinths
are constructed as contiguous lines

424
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,032
along concentric circles.

425
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,793
One way in, one way out.

426
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,109
But this 0ne's different.

427
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,709
Undoubtedly.

428
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,718
Those red rectangles.

429
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,517
They're unbound on one side.

430
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,111
And they overlap black lines which
would lead out of the labyrinth.

431
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
So maybe we're not looking at plans.

432
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
But the end result.

433
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,994
Voilâ. Look familiar?

434
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,439
So, this is Wayne Enterprises.

435
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,158
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

436
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,197
These are the buildings Jeremiah's
planning to demolish with his bombs.

437
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,393
Once those buildings are blown,

438
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,595
they collapse and create

439
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,176
the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

440
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,919
Jeremiah lived his entire life
in a maze.

441
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,958
Now he's trying to remake the city
into the place he feels most safe.

442
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,917
It's actually rather elegant.

we get this information to the mayor.

legal knots we need untangled.

the rest of our lives together.

447

to hold the city hostage?

Time is running out.

449
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,720
Well, then the mayor would be wise to
forgive Lee and I our indiscretions.

- Shut up!

639
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,074
I want you all to know

640
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,354
I find your fickleness

641
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,272
quite hurtful.

642
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,032

646
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,474
Well, that is disappointing.

647
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,096
You know, if you had asked me
this morning

648
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,838
how many people I was gonna kill today,

649
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,719
I would have been way off.

650
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,030
Perhaps the outcome
was not what we had hoped.

651
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,476
- But it was worth the risk.
- BARBARA: Ozzy,

652
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,757
if I were you, I would limp
out of here while you still can.

653
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Fine.

654
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,232
- Let's go, Butch.
- Nope.

655
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,510
I'm done.

656
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,632
Ever since we teamed up,
everything's gone to crap.

657
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,360
Hell, we don't even know
where Strange is.

658
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,079
Except, I do know where Strange is.

659
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,896
(SHOUTING) You mean to tell me you've
known where he is the whole time

660
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
and never told me?

661
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,470
- (CHOKING) Ijust got word.
- No more excuses.

662
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,631
He fixes me now!

663
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,553
And how exactly do we pay him?

664
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,150
I can be very persuasive.

665
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,076
Think, think, think.

666
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,958
How did they beat you, huh?

667
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,231
How did they figure you out?

668
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,070
Gordon must have stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

669
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,436
found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

673
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,796
I had a vision of Gotham in flames.

674
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,233
Together we can make that happen.

675
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,311
Well, I appreciate the offer,

676
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,711
but recent events have convinced me
of the benefits of working alone.

You're behind me, aren't you?

682
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,837
I can conquer Gotham on my own.

683
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,752
What makes you think I need your help?

684
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,514
Whoever you are.

685
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,034
Because, my boy.

686
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,478
All this is not just about Gotham.

687
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,549
This is about Bruce Wayne.

688
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,629
You here to arrest me?

689
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
To thank you.

690
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,072
And to present you with an offer.

691
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Leave Gotham.

692
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,952
Start a new life somewhere else.
Alone.

693
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,715
And if I don't?

694
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,838
I know we can't change the past.

695
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
What we've done...

696
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
We've done to each other.

697
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,513
I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

698
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,189
But whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

699
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I care about you.

700
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
And I always will.

701
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,117
Lucius, call the mayor.

702
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,111
Tell him not to lift
the evacuation order

703
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,316
until all the bombs
are under lock and key.

704
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,712
And I want every cop out there
to keep looking for Jeremiah Valeska.

705
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
What?

706
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,517
Give it up for Harvey Bullock.

MAN: Give it up.

709
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,712
Dude, come on.

710
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,870
Thank you. No. come on.

711
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,113
Right. Well, I'm going to take
a very long and a very hot shower.

712
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,271
And then I'm going to make us
a legendary fry-up.

713
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,112
Will you be joining us, Miss Kyle?

714
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,193
- I've got no plans.
- Excellent

715
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,075
You all right, mate?

716
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,109
Okay. then.

717
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,314
Thank you again.

718
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,754
I don't know what would have
happened if you weren't there.

719
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,074
You're welcome.

720
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,070
Why do you think
he's so obsessed with you?

721
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,755
Jeremiah said, "AII it takes is one
bad day to drive a person insane."

722
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,232
I wonder if my parents dying
made me a little insane?

723
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,359
Maybe he sensed that.

724
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,717
Maybe he wanted to bring it out.

725
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,439
Well, you proved him wrong.

726
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,960
JEREMIAH: To be fair,

727
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,394
