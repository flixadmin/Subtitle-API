00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:04,505
This is a fucking mess, son,
but don't you worry.

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,342
Daddy's home.

00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,099
- What's up, shitbirds?
- [both scream]

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,644
You have five minutes
to make your opening st...

- You guys fucking ready?

00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,815
[Homelander] <i>So Noir's a vegetable.</i>

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,942
And you didn't do this.

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,279
Look, there was no terrorist.

9
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,615
<i>It was Vought. It's a fucking coup.</i>

10
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,784
Victoria Neuman's making a team
that can keep tabs on the Supes.

11
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,203
If you're interested.

12
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,913
I still want to fight Vought.

13
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:39,248
I just... I want to do it the right way.

14
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,167
Not covered in quite as many guts.

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,712
- Maeve!
- I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,506
You're gonna leave me and Elena alone.

17

<i>You're gonna stop hunting Starlight,</i>

18
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,636

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,762
Becca's alive.

[screams]

22
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,478
I do not want my son to have to
go through what I went through.

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,812
Ryan, no!

24
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,606
Promise me that you will save him
no matter what

25
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,107
and you will get him back to me.

[Stormfront]
<i>People love what I have to say.</i>

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,863
<i>They believe in it.</i>

28
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,824
They just don't like the word "Nazi."
That's all.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,536
Becca!

30
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,415
- Where is my son?

Stormfront.

36
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,297
I knew you'd be here.

37
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,349
How could you do this?

38
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,062
I loved you.

39
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,356
You'll always be in my heart.

40
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,485
But the Fourth Reich is in my soul.

41
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,908
Join me, and we can reign together
for a thousand years.

42
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,535
Never.

43
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,203
You and I are the same.

44
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,247
Perfect genetic specimens.

45
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,667
Think of how beautiful
our children could be.

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,378
They would be the best of both of us.

Flawless Aryan <i>Kindersoldaten.</i>

No.

49
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,722
They'd be monsters.

50
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,891
Like you.

51

Your choice, <i>Liebchen.</i>

But not even you could stop me alone.

[Starlight] He's not alone.

54
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:19,909
What?

55
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,952
Can't let you guys have all the fun.

56
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,209
Guess this means we're breaking up.

Look to your right.

[photographer 3] Maeve!
To your left! Left!

[photographer 4] Maeve, over here!

72
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,604
[reporter] Here with Adam Bourke,

73
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,565
- the director of <i>Dawn of The Seven.</i>
- Yes. That's right.

74
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,692
It seems like all those
reshoots paid off, my friend.

75
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,277
Right, well, after the, you know,

76
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,779
"Stormfront's a Nazi" thing,
we had real talks about

77
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,532
shelving the movie
or just dumping it on Vought Plus.

78
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,827
But, uh, the fans spoke with those
"Release the Bourke Cut" hashtags.

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,120
You guys, I love you!

80

00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,701
And thanks to Congresswoman Neuman
for joining us tonight.

96
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,245
I hope it demonstrates
Vought welcomes the oversight

from the Bureau of Superhuman Affairs.

If I could just steal him away.

Do me a favor and kill me.

102
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,674

- Okay.

Real soon.

109

You know, but we had reshoots,
I've been training.

110
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,607
But that race is coming,

111
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,151
full speed ahead
for the A-Train. [chuckles]

112
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,986
But it's been over a year,
and the people are wondering...

113
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,363
Only questions about the movie.

114
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,240
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

Who'd have thought,
after everything we've been through,

124
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,843
- that we'd be here together?
- [photographer] Okay, one more time.

125
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,095
Right in the camera.

126
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,263
Yeah.

127
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,682
Who'd have thought?

128
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,728
[reporter] How could you not know
all along that Stormfront was a Nazi?

129
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,065
Well, I am just a man
who fell for the wrong woman.

130
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,525
- Uh, but, uh...
- Fell for the wrong woman.

131
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,277
But out of crisis comes change.

132
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,446
- Out of crisis comes change.
- So I spent the last year

133
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,366
really slowing down
and reconnecting with myself.

134
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,661
And I am very excited
for everyone to meet the real me.

Tony Gilroy had to reshoot all your shit!

I found that little asshole
we've been on all month.

He's having a knees-up
at a penthouse tonight.

Okay. Who's your source?

158
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,477
My source
is none of your fucking business.

159
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,731
Look, me and the Boys, we're all set up.
We just need you to, uh...

160
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,359
give us a green light.

It's okay. All right.

[Todd] Let's all say, um,
"Happy birthday, Janine!"

[all] Happy birthday, Janine!

I'm fine, Monique.

495
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,681
This is just me helping out
at my daughter's birthday party.

496
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,058
Great party, by the way.

00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,102
Yeah, she's...

00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,645
[laughs] She's having fun.

499
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,857
I'm sorry about all the superhero stuff.

500
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,525
- She insisted, and...
- It's all good.

501
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,318
It's behind me now. I'm over it.

502
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,363
You've seen me
in the last 12 months, right?

503
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,991
I'm straight. It's ancient history.

504
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,036
- I know.
- Hey.

505
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,122
You got a couple of hours on Friday night?

506
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,460
I was thinking maybe we could
meet over at Cafe Delfini's,

507
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,962
have some tilapia, go over
some co-parenting things.

508
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,255
Mmm, co-parenting things?

509
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,715
- Yeah.
- Really?

510
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,550
Where we had our first date?

511
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,595
Strictly business.

512
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,723
Scheduling things,
like soccer practice, dance recital...

513
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,892
You got to move on, Marvin.

514
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,394
The way you moved on with Todd or...

V24, huh?

00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,060
[Edgar] Marketing
is still testing the name.

But it's the future, Bob.

525
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,315
One dose of this temporary V

526
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,567
gives a soldier 24 hours of powers.

527
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,819
Give or take.

528
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,404
And then they return right back to normal.

529
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,739
How stable is it?

530
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,867
Still ironing out the kinks.

531
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,285
And if it's temporary,

532
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,539
that means the DOD
has to keep buying doses.

533
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,250
At how much a hit?

534
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,835
Two million, roughly.

535
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,379
So over the course
of a month-long operation,

536
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,631
that's 60 million per soldier.

537
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,800
600 million per squad.

538
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,595
Campaign going well, is it?

539
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,849
I appreciate your contribution
to my super PAC.

540
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,017
People do love
a cowboy in the White House.

I hear they're even
calling you Dakota Bob.

542
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,898
So how would it look
if you pass up the opportunity

543
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,234
to give our brave soldiers superpowers?

544
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:17,572
Supes in the Army
are an unmitigated shit show.

545
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:22,076
What Black Noir did
to that Hard Rock Cafe in Lagos?

You are absolutely right.

550
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,561
The problem, of course,
was making the super into heroes.

551
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,396
I don't follow.

552
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,607
Making them figures to be worshipped.

553
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,358
The fame, the movies,

554
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,194
the depraved sex... it ruined them.

555
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,571
Cone of silence?

556
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,657
In five years, I hope to be out
of the superhero business entirely.

557
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,117
Bullshit.

558
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,702
This should be a serious company.

559
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,787
A defense and pharmaceutical company.

560
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,417
Not a day care dealing with
spoiled children and dead prostitutes.

561
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,212
But the point is,
you won't have to worry about any of that.

562
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:19,717
Because your soldiers
will only be super... temporarily.

563
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,722
The product... finally perfected.

564

Gestapo.

00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,152
Swastika.

570
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,237
And that's your fault.

that I can pull in Congress.

I got good news and bad news.
What do you want to hear first?

00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,134
The, uh, good news.

578
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,427
There's no good news.

579
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,597
Bad news is, Termite's off the table.

580
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,265
- What?
- Vought just closed

a big endorsement for him with Terminex.

582

We've been chasing Termite for months!

583
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,897
I know, but after Butcher force-fed him
a metric Belushi of coke,

584
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,691
I didn't have much leverage, did I?

585
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:20,987
It was just a little coke
'cause he was... small.

586
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,156
Anyway, he's going to the Global
Wellness Retreat in Malibu,

587
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,742
and in return we're getting
Cold Snap, Stacker and Airburst.

588
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,703
Fucking B-listers! Really?

589
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,371
Three B-listers, real assholes.

590
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,540
Cold Snap for domestic battery.

591
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:33,833
It's not a bad trade.

592
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,795
How much is Supe collateral
down this year?

593
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,924
- Sixty percent.
- Sixty percent.

594
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,261
That's 60% more people at home
with their kids, and we did that.

Hughie, you and I built this place.

And we did it the right way
without being covered in blood and guts.

Right?

You're irritating, but...

- Okay.

- Winning, are we?
- Yeah.

614

Locking up a couple of nobodies
ain't winning.

They got all the money and all the power,
and they want us dead.

before they do it to us.

a little bit...

Excuse me, Starlight.

660
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,461
I need the room.
I got a meeting with Stan.

661
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,504
Actually, I invited you both.

662
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:08,797
Have a seat.

663
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,550
- Great.
- Oh, uh...

664
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,062
[grunts, sighs]

665
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,900
I remember when you first arrived,
Starlight.

666
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,402
A farm girl from Kansas.

667
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,655
Bright-eyed like Dorothy in Oz.

668
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,323
Iowa. And not a farm.

669
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,866
Oh, well, look how far you've come.

670
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,161
Polling at 96, a new Vought record.

671
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,831
I don't have to tell you
that our brand has been a bit tarnished

672
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,209
since that nasty business last year.

673
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,587
But you have restored a wholesome,

674
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,507
trustworthy image to the company
when we needed it the most.

675
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,802
Which is why the board
wants to make you...

676
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,929
cocaptain of The Seven.

677
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,013
What?

678
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,181
Co...

679
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,017
Cocaptain?

680
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,229
[stammers]

681
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,897
But-but... [chuckles]

682
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,109
Homelander is captain.
I mean, you're-you're captain.

683
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,278
This will be beneficial to you both.

684
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,905
Your numbers are down,
what, uh, double digits?

685
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,533
The public still associates you
with Stormfront.

686
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,576
This would be a real bump.

687
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,621
A rising tide lifts all boats.

688
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,873
That's very thoughtful of you, Stan.

689
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,000
Um...

690
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,297
- When does the board vote?
- They already did this morning.

691
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,590
All that's left
is for Starlight to say yes.

692
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,885
No. I mean, I mean, I'm flattered,

693
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,513
thank you, but no, thank you.

694
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,807
If anybody, it should be Maeve.

695
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
Maeve doesn't have a 96.

696
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,895
Nobody does. Except you, apparently.

697
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,689
[chuckles]

698
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,483
Homelander?

699
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,611
Could you give us a moment?

700
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,947
Look, I'd really like
to keep discussing this.

701
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,783
Absolutely. Set a time with Samantha,
and we'll get you in.

702
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,581
[laughs]

703
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,166
Mmm, great.

704
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,461
- No problem.
- [Edgar] Excellent.

705
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:14,214
My schedule is pretty full,
but I'll try and find you a window.

706
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,764
Okay, sir, there is no way.
I mean, you saw him. He's...

707
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,099
He can get as pissy as he wants.

708
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:28,020
As long as I'm CEO of Vought,
he's under control, and we both know why.

709
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,357
Y-You know that he can,
he can probably hear you.

710
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,359
Good. I hope he does.

711
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,777
Starlight.

712
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,237
Real power...

713
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,199
isn't this.

714
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,911
It's the ability to bend the world
to your will.

715
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,705
You would decide what The Seven do.

716
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,249
What causes they support.

717
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:55,172
Full authority
to fill the team's empty slots.

718
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,219
I'm offering you...

719
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,847
real power.

720
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,266
You should think about it.

721

[door opens]

722
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,753
It's been almost a year since
Church Chairman Alastair Adana

723
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,422
has been seen in public.

724
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,258
Yeah, well, they say he's on,
uh, sabbatical, but who knows?

725
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:45,180
What I do know is that there are
literally thousands of tortured souls

726
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,640
who are trapped in that church right now

727
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,475
who want to escape
just like me and my wife did.

728
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,269
- That's very brave.
- Thank you.

729
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,647
Your book <i>Deeper</i> has been a game changer.

Annie and I snuck into a cantina.

And he, you know, took your virginity,
so why would I worry?

797
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,194
Okay, it was a mutual
taking of virginities.

798
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,947
And you know what,
it happened so long ago,

799
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,490
and only a couple of times.

800
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,201
- Wait, really?
- Yeah, you know, we were really religious,

801
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,371
and we weren't married,
so it felt weird having sex.

802
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,248
I mean, sex-sex.

803
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,043
We did a ton of butt stuff.

804
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,714
I'm fucking with you.

805
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,466
- [laughs] Okay.
- [laughs]

806
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,676
- Come on.
- Yeah, never do that again.

807
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,179
Wow, uh...

808
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,388
[chuckles]

809
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,725
Cocaptain, huh? Wow, that's, uh...

810
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,809
Is it crazy?

811
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,936
I mean, Vought's the worst thing
that's ever happened to us,

812
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,396
and now you want
to be their Ronald McDonald?

813
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,689
So, yeah, a little crazy.

814
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:28,028
Yeah, but first female cocaptain
of any super team.

815
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,363
Ever. I mean...

816
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,532
think about what that would mean
to millions of girls.

817
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,202
I'm sorry, I-I'm just surprised, I guess.

818
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,079
I mean, is this your mom talking or you?

819
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,123
[sighs] I'm the one whose feet bled

820
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,167
at all of those pageants.

821
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,753
Okay? I've paid a lot.

822
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,256
And, finally, finally,
I could have some real power

823
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,343
that I could use,
and I could make trouble at Vought.

824
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,678
Do some real good.

825
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,221
Or Homelander can murder you.

826
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,223
Someone needs to stand up to this guy.

827
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,849
- And that has to be you?
- Not just me.

828
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,686
I mean, I could bring good people
into The Seven who could help me.

829
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,396
What, you mean like your boyfriend?

830
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,443
It's not a good look, Hughie.

831
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,530
No one even bats an eye
when a man climbs the ladder.

832
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,031
Okay, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

833
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,533
Look, I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

834
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:18,412
So I'll see you later tonight?

835
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,540
Don't bother with the Aquafresh.

836
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,502
[door opens]

837
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:26,962
- [door slams shut]
- [cameras clicking]

838
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,256
- [door slams shut]
- [cameras clicking]

839
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:38,014
[cameras popping loudly]

840
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,021
[high-pitched ringing]

841
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,694
[muffled] Hey, Homelander.

842
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,532
- [Homelander] What are you drinking?
- [ringing stops]

843
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,871
- Shake Shack.
- Oh.

844
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,998
You want one? I'll go grab a PA for...

845
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,292
Oh, no, no. Thank you, though.

846
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,460
Yeah.

847
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,296
I see you got the extra
whipped cream in there, huh?

848
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,464
[laughs] Yeah.

849
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,673
Yummers.

850
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,595
I guess you wanted to cram in
as much "fat fuck" as possible, huh?

851
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,557
- Did I do something wrong?
- You think I haven't seen you?

852
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,352
Shoving back two dozen cupcakes
in the breakroom?

853
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,272
Nine servings
on Miro's truffle risotto night?

854
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,899
- Hmm?
- Hey, man.

855
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,194
You know I need 30,000 calories a day.

856
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,779
Maybe when you actually ran, you did.

857
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,448
But now you're just eating your feelings.

858
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,408
Making us look ridiculous.

859
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:42,871
"The Fastest Man Alive."
What a fucking joke.

860
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,166
- [quietly] Fuck you, man.
- What did you say?

861
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,629
Nothing. Nothing.

862
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,590
- What did you say to me?
- I'm sorry.

863
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,091
I'm sorry. Shit!

864
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,802
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean it.

865
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,638
- Say it.
- I'm s...

866
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,349
- Say it!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

867
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,440
[panting]

868
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,006
[reporter] <i>But not everyone
rejects Stormfront.</i>

869
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:38,718
<i>A group called the Stormchasers
still celebrate her racist dogma.</i>

870
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,346
<i>After finding each other on 4chan,</i>

871
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,891
<i>the Stormchasers rallied online
in the days and weeks after...</i>

872
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,142
[Homelander] How are you?

873
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,519
[breathing shakily]

874
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,188
Wonderful now that you're here.

875
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,526
Is something wrong, my love?

876
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,444
You know, I'm just...

877
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,615
skulking around
like a frightened schoolgirl.

878
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,451
Apologizing when I've done nothing wrong.

879
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,495
[wheezing]

880
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:06,872
[sighs]

881
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:12,127
Today, uh, they made Starlight cocaptain.

882
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,379
[wheezes] No.

883
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,881
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

884
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,633
My poor baby.

885
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:20,844
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

886
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:25,140
- No one suffers like you suffer.
- Mm-mmm.

887
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,933
Let me help.

888
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,894
[Homelander] Honestly...

889
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,771
I have to put up
with these fucking people.

890
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,816
[bed whirring]

891
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,860
They hold that video
over my head month after month.

892
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,571
[sighs] They took my son from me.

893
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,616
They want me... Here you go.

894
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:45,619
[exhales] See, they want me weak,
castrated.

895
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,662
They should be worshipping me.

896
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,372
Tremble at my feet.

897
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,917
[grunts] Put a knife
to their children's throat,

898
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,003
like Abraham to Isaac, if I say so.

899
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,504
Oh, they will.

900
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:01,426
When you lead an army
of Aryan <i>Ubermensch</i> to their victory.

901
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,386
What? No.

902
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,221
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

903
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,849
No, no! How many times
do I have to tell you?

904
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,517
We don't need a fucking master race.

905
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,728
I'm the master race. That's the point.

906
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,980
That's the whole point.

907
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,983
No, you have to.

908
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,903
It took a hundred years,
but we finally found you.

909
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,154
- No, no.
- It's your destiny.

910
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,822
Oh, my God. Whatever.

911
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,116
- [pants zip]
- [whimpers]

912
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,868
Just, uh...

913
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:29,287
- rest.
- What?

914
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,665
No. Please.

915
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,251
Please!

916
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,255
[whimpers]

917
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,550
[panting]

918
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,136
[sirens wailing in distance]

919
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,764
[door opens, closes]

920
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,393
[Maeve] I heard Termite walked.

921
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,896
My lead was good. What happened?

922
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,068
Don't ask.

923
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,446
Well, we got to talk.

924
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,576
I think I have something.

925
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,377
Soldier Boy. So what?

926
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,837
Remember how he died?

927
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,172
Stopping a nuclear meltdown in Ohio.

928
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:24,467
'83, '84, I think,
got buried beneath a reactor.

929
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,136
Always thought it was bollocks.

930
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,013
Yeah, you thought right.

931
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,432
Read.

932
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,643
What's BCL RED?

933
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,396
If you believe the rumors,
it's the thing that killed Soldier Boy.

934
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,982
Some kind of gun or weapon or something.

935
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,901
Had to have been a fucking H-bomb.
He was nearly as strong as...

936
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,614
Ah.

937
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:51,578
If we can find this weapon
or whatever it is,

938
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:56,583
maybe we can use it
to blow Homelander's fucking brains out.

939
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,629
If it is real, not some fucking fable.

940
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,347
Payback. [scoffs]

941
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,184
- What a bunch of fucking wankers.
- I'll say.

942
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,771
When The Seven passed them
as the number one super team,

943
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,315
Crimson Countess sent me
a box of cat shit.

944
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,109
She was fucking Soldier Boy.

945
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:25,361
And, uh, Gunpowder was his sidekick.

946
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,823
If anyone knows
what happened to him, they do.

947
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,326
Your mate Noir was in Payback.

948
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,078
- Why don't you ask him?
- [scoffs]

949
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,624
Even if that walking tumor could talk,
it wouldn't be to me. Here.

950
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,379
[Butcher] What's this?

951
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,923
It's Temp V.

952
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,218
One shot makes you a Supe for 24 hours.

953
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:53,556
I mean, they think. It's still in R&D.

954

like footballs. Yeah?

956
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,065
Payback may be a bunch of fuck holes,
but they're strong.

957
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,691
And they're dangerous.

958
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,653
If you're going against them,
you're gonna need it.

959
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:14,244
And what makes you think that me,

960
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:17,205
of all people, would want
to turn into one of you?

961

This is our best chance
to kill Homelander.

May I come in?

968
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,158
Where's Ryan?

969
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:42,123
He's at 673 Nosh My Bollocks Ave.

970
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,083
You want a pen and paper?

971
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:48,463
You know I could just pull you apart
limb by limb.

Make you tell me.

Nah, that'd be worthless.

I don't mean to be rude,

but can we just skip to the part
where you laser my fucking brains out?

Oh, for Christ sakes.

Where's the sport in that?

985
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,081
No, look at you.

986
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,001
It'd be like putting down a wounded dog.

987

with your tail between your legs

on all them fucking talk shows.

989
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,841
And then they go
and make Starlight cocaptain.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

What are you doing here?

995
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,115
Vought and the fucking bureau.

996
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,617
The wheeling and dealing.

997
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,703
And-and-and-and giving and taking.

998
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,831
Just to keep everything exactly the same.

999
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,792
And you and me?

1000
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,296
Well, they treat us like old playthings
and put us up on the fucking shelf?

1001
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:12,463
Hmm?

1002

1003
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,886
Doesn't that make you angry?

1004
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,351
Yeah.

1005
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,229
It does.
