1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,299
[rock music playing]

2
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,858
You two here
to pick up your grandchildren?

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,317
Come on, Babs,

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,278
you got the only full bar in Gotham.

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,780
And if you two dinosaurs want
to keep coming here,

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,532
you better up your intel.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,118
We got a lead
on some black-market heating oil.

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,831
One drink...

9
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,207
To share.

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,502
Then you go wheeze
to death somewhere else.

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,844
[woman chuckling] Mmm-hmm.

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,429
Would you look at that?

13
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,849
Dix!

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,975
Look at you.

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,854
Up and walking around?
You old son of a bitch.

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,065
I've been looking for you two
for a while now.

17
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
Well, you found us.

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,069
You two ever think about the past?

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,780
What we did?

20
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,365
What are you talking about, Dix?

21
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,492
About her.

22
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,536
About what we did to the girl.

23
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,249
[Barbara] Who is that?

24
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,835
It's like the living dead in here.
Enough of this.

25
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,839
[both groaning]

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,968
Hey, gramps.

27
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,304
[Barbara gasps]

28
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,651
[Alfred] Can you please repeat
your story for Mr. Wayne, madam?

29
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,737
We live in a shelter in West End.

30
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,698
There are so many of us
crammed in there,

31
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,661
so much uncertainty, fear...

32
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,540
And with the river poisoned,
it should have been awful, but...

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,459
People came together,
made it a home.

34
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,795
What happened?

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,088
Couple of weeks ago,

36
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,675
we heard rumors about
something underneath the building.

37
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,678
We're connected to the sewer,

38
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,806
and people started going missing.

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,684
Hank, my husband,

40
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,312
wanted to look for them.

41
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,941
Said we were a family.

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,652
So the two of you went
searching for them.

43
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,197
It was so dark.

44
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,825
I didn't see what attacked us.

45
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,163
I hit my head and when I woke up,
Hank was gone. [crying]

46
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,625
Please, Mr. Wayne...

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,254
we have a daughter.

48
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,549
We'll do everything we can.

49
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,016
Should we tell Gordon?

50
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,518
Why, he's stretched thin as it is.

51
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,146
Alfred, we don't know
who or what is down there.

52
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,732
We know there's a man
down there in danger.

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,984
And we know this lady sent for us.

54
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,904
So go on then,
what do you think we should do?

55
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,657
Let's go find him.

56
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,120
Under normal circumstances,

57
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,831
I wouldn't call you
for a couple of stiffs.

58
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,042
What do you normally do when
a couple of your patrons get stabbed?

59
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,168
Bury the bodies.

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,045
Find out who did it
and then bury those bodies.

61
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,047
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

62
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,965
We're living in
a different world, Harvey.

63
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,425
[Gordon]
So, why did you call us?

64
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,968
[Barbara] Take a look.

65
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,724
Boggs and Lewis...

66
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,267
You know them?

67
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,479
They were cops, they were gone
before you joined. What happened?

68
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,482
They came around
peddling third-rate intel.

69
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,150
It was closing time,
so I let them in.

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,194
And then,
some other fossil knifed them.

71
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,320
You saw him?

72
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,364
Yeah. He must have snuck in.
Looked like a cop too.

73
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,531
These two knew him.

74
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,618
Bartender said
they called him "Mix," "Hicks"...

75
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,871
-"Dix"?
-Maybe.

76
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,706
No way.

77
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,084
Dix was Harvey's old partner.

78
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,669
There we go, case closed.

79
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,421
So, you're telling me, this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

80
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,131
stabbed these two and rolled on out?

81
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,133
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

82
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,803
Then it couldn't be Dix. He's been
paralyzed for the last 15 years.

83
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,764
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

84
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,057
I called you as a courtesy, and now,

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm wishing I'd just dumped
these two corpses in an alley.

86
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,480
Do we even know that Dix is still
in Gotham after the bridges blew?

87
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,900
I heard he moved into
an apartment about a year ago.

88
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,320
I meant to check up on him,
but... It can't be him.

89
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,614
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

90
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,740
Maybe he knows something.

91
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,076
Fine.

92
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,836
How are you feeling?

93
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,671
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

94
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,339
Look,

95
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,966
I've been giving you space,

96
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,467
but we have to talk about
how this is gonna work.

97
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,635
I'm gonna be
a part of this kid's life.

98
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,470
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

99
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,930
I am.

100
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,598
Reunification's gonna happen,

101
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,934
you should think about what kind of
person you want to be when it does.

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,479
It's a chance for you to start anew.

103
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,982
I like who I am.

104
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,775
Uh-huh.

105
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,907
[door closes]

106
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,885
[bells ringing]

107
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,518
You were due hours ago.

108
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,562
Yes, I was.

109
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,230
But I had to get us lunch.

110
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,356
And I met Dale.

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,649
I see that.

112
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,776
Do you see this?

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,571
Our secret plan
to get off this island.

114
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,449
Relax. Dale is
completely trustworthy.

115
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,619
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

116
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,163
Because, he's mute
and dumb as a post.

117
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,042
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us...

118
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,044
Someone is watching us!

119
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,130
Why do you think
I installed this alarm system?

120
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,594
[scoffs] And as safe as I feel with
your jingle-bell contraption in place,

121
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,181
I went out and procured us
some muscle. You're welcome.

122
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,434
At least you're doing something.

123
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,685
Ah!

124
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,939
How's my SS <i>Gertrude</i> coming along?

125
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,275
Our submarine is coming along
just fine, thank you.

126
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,528
I've been working on the sonar,

127
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,824
which turns out is far more
complex than I anticipated.

128
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,159
Well, I am confident
you'll figure it out.

129
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,705
Of course I will figure it out.

130
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,584
Because, I figure everything out.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,795
The navigation system,

132
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,421
the oxygen exchange.

133
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,093
I will figure everything out
because I'm the only one working!

134
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,595
This was supposed
to be a partnership.

135
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,805
It is!

136
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,142
I already did my part by stealing
everything valuable in Gotham,

137
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,436
-of which you get half.
-No!

138
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,021
Your goon stole it.
And then you killed him.

139
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,690
[bells ringing]

140
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,608
Are you expecting someone?

141
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,360
Who would I be expecting, Oswald?

142
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,195
I told you someone's watching us.

143
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,448
Dale, go do what I pay you for.

144
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,034
Protect us.

145
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,081
Wait!

146
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,084
Penn?

147
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,588
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

148
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,216
Are you really...

149
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,052
I don't believe it. You're alive.

150
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,305
Indeed, sir. I am.

151
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,392
But, you were shot. I was there.

152
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,521
This whole time, I thought
you were dead, but you're alive.

153
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,273
[Penguin laughing]

154
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
You're only coming to me now?

155
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,070
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Cobblepot,

156
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,823
I wanted to come see you, but...

157
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,118
He wouldn't let me.

158
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,913
"He"? He, who?

159
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,708
Mr. Cobblepot,

160
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,130
this is...

161
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,969
Mr. Scarface.

162
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,563
Wonderful.

163
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,320
Look, I'm sure Dix is in the clear,
but we do have to ask.

164
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,699
That's not it.

165
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,327
I just... I feel bad.

166
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,996
I should have been by before,
I'm all he's got.

167
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,624
Well, look, what can you do, right?

168
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,632
Dix!

169
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,092
What the hell?

170
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,386
Bullock, that you?

171
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,762
Yeah.

172
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,139
-Don't shoot.
-Okay.

173
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,559
Come in.

174
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,936
Uh-huh.

175
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,438
[Harvey] Is that the way you
always answer the door?

176
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,483
Nowadays, you can't be too careful.

177
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,402
Especially someone like me.

178
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,238
A kid comes in, he'd cut
my throat for a cup of soup.

179
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,406
[Harvey] Uh-huh.

180
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,575
[Dix] Anyway, I wasn't expecting you.

181
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,286
Figured you forgot about me.

182
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,206
Look, partner, when the bridges
came down, I got busy, and...

183
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,792
Oh, sure, sure, you forgot me.

184
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,168
Everybody forgets.

185
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,837
I didn't forget.

186
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,423
You planning on taking a trip?

187
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,842
Maybe.

188
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,553
I like to keep a bag packed
just in case.

189
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,179
Yeah? Where were you last night?

190
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,266
Where was I? I was right here.

191
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,019
Anybody else here with you?
Anybody that can back up your story?

192
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,398
You're asking me if I was out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

193
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,945
Does it look like I was out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

194
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,071
So, you heard about that?

195
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,699
Let me tell you something.

196
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,328
If it meant that I can get out of
this son-of-a-bitch wheelchair,

197
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,624
I would confess right here
and now to Boggs, to Lewis,

198
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,626
to anybody you want me to confess to.

199
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,337
All right. Fine.
But, you were a detective,

200
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,588
what would you say if you were us?

201
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,757
We come in here,
you're packing a suitcase.

202
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,137
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't...

203
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,849
Or, I'd be very worried
that I'd be next.

204
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,768
What do you mean, you being next?

205
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,770
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

206
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,440
Come on, what?

207
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,775
Nothing.

208
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,653
I just worked with them. That's it.

209
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,407
We, uh... We worked a case together.

210
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,578
-The four of you?
-[Harvey] Yeah.

211
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,039
Dix wasn't my partner then.

212
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,749
I was a rookie cop.

213
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,584
Wet behind the ears.

214
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,919
So, what was the case?

215
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,212
Woman killed her husband,

216
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,339
as far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

217
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,133
But, at least, we can agree

218
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,387
that Dix didn't walk into The Sirens
and stab those two guys.

219
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,638
So, who did?

220
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,183
Barbara said Boggs and Lewis
recognized the killer.

221
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,476
They called him "Dix."

222
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,520
We come in here,
he's packing a suitcase,

223
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,897
-he shoots at us. This stinks, Harvey.
-[knocking on door]

224
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,947
Hey.

225
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,578
[both groaning]

226
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,707
[Gordon] You all right?

227
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,875
[panting]

228
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,504
What the hell?

229
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,603
[Alfred] These basements run
along Gotham sewers.

230
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,273
The river is right next to it.

231
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,859
You mean, the river
filled with Jeremiah's toxins?

232
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,487
Who knows that kind of damage
these chemicals could do.

233
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,114
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,785
Just don't you touch anything.

235
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,050
Hold on.

236
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,523
Bite marks.

237
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,860
Animal?

238
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,653
Well, it's no human I've ever seen.

239
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,490
And whatever it was...

240
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,285
It dragged him that way.

241
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,539
[Gordon] Seems like human skin.

242
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,168
Here's the file you asked for.
Victoria Cartwright.

243
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,086
How did you, uh...

244
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,380
I had Harper run every case
the four of you worked

245
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,592
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

246
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,552
Do I need to read it,
or you gonna tell me what's in it?

247
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,347
Victoria Cartwright was a banker,

248
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,973
she led a very boring life.

249
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:33,062
Until she snapped and put two
.38-caliber slugs into her husband.

250
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,188
End of story.

251
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,524
You guys rehearse that?

252
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
Says here,
there was no physical evidence.

253
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,700
She was convicted on the statement of
her seven-year-old daughter, Jane.

254
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,161
This was 20 years ago.
Where's Jane now?

255
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,121
What's the point? The killer's a man.

256
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,290
A man that can
imitate friggin' faces.

257
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,960
What was the name of the guy
that Strange got to imitate you,

258
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,336
Basil something?

259
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,004
That's who we should be looking for.

260
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,256
That was different and you know it.

261
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,425
-We have an address for this Jane?
-No.

262
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,928
But the family's old home is in the
Green Zone, just east of the clinic.

263
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,513
Jim, it's a dead end.

264
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,348
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

265
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,228
You know what,
why don't you hang back?

266
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,354
Whoa, whoa. Wait.

267
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,440
-You benching me?
-Killer's still out there.

268
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,608
Keep an eye on your partner.

269
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,869
[Penguin] Penn, Arnold...

270
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,496
It's Arthur.

271
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,290
[Penguin chuckles]

272
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,916
You're holding a doll.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,251
It's not a doll.

274
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,461
It's a dummy.

275
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,131
Oh, this is great.

276
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,258
I'm going back to work. Excuse me.

277
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,969
You're saying he made you come here?

278
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,388
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

279
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,307
[laughing]

280
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,892
"Persuasive"?

281
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,564
He made me tell him
about your [softly] treasure.

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,942
Penn...

283
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,487
I think you need a rest.

284
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,574
And perhaps, a psychiatrist.

285
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,953
Then we can discuss you
resuming your former duties.

286
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,040
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone.

287
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,708
Shut your pie-hole!

288
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,337
This the one you were
telling me about?

289
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,255
Punk who thinks he's in charge?

290
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,342
Yes, sir. That's Mr. Cobblepot.

291
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,511
Oswald, if you don''t
make him leave, I will.

292
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,681
No one's going anywheres.

293
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,769
Penn, show these two jokers
we're serious.

294
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,939
Forgive me.

295
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,652
[Dale groans]

296
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,533
Now, let's talk turkey,

297
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,285
turkeys.

298
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,917
What a mess, huh?

299
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,335
Yeah.

300
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,672
Boggs and Lewis were idiots,
complete idiots.

301
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,301
They should have known when they
see a guy walking, that it ain't me.

302
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,471
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

303
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,223
How would I know?

304
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,770
So, how have you been
since the bridges came down?

305
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
You getting enough food, medicine?

306
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,025
What if I said no?

307
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,152
I'd feel like crap.

308
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,530
Then, no.

309
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,282
[Dix chuckles]

310
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,120
The Cartwright girl is dead.

311
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,040
A buddy of mine
who was a screw over at Arkham,

312
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,711
he said she was an inmate there,
and she died a couple of years ago.

313
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,171
So, this has nothing to do with her.

314
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,509
[wind howling]

315
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,978
GCPD.

316
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,354
Coming in.

317
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,366
Check upstairs.

318
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,048
[Harper] Looks like this place
has been abandoned

319
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,674
since before the bridges came down.

320
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,800
Yeah.

321
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,320
[wind howling]

322
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,871
[breathing heavily]

323
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,297
[officer] What the hell?

324
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,021
[officer groans]

325
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,107
[tinkling]

326
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,068
What the hell was that?

327
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,582
[woman grunting]

328
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,111
[wind howling]

329
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,294
Someone's been living here.

330
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,880
What's that smell?

331
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,974
[door opens]

332
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,852
Everything all right?

333
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,522
All good. No one's here.

334
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,657
Hey.

335
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,035
[all grunting]

336
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,997
[groaning]

337
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,088
[woman] Don't look at me.

338
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,340
Don't look at me!

339
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,846
[Gordon] We found your handiwork.

340
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,560
Nothing to say?

341
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,606
You're gonna have to
take that mask off.

342
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,111
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

343
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,529
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna
reach over this table</i>

344
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>and I'm gonna rip it
off of your face.</i>

345
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,163
-Who are you?
-Nobody.

346
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,499
You're not Jane Cartwright?

347
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,711
Because you were
in her childhood home.

348
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,297
You're about the right age.

349
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,132
Talk to me, Jane.

350
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,470
I know after your mother
was convicted,

351
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,846
you ended up a ward of the State.

352
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,725
In and out of institutions
until you ended up in Arkham.

353
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,353
Then you vanished.

354
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
Some say, died.

355
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,110
-What happened to you?
-Me?

356
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,488
Nothing happened to me.

357
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,616
Okay.

358
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,245
What happened to Jane?

359
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,291
[Jane] Oh...

360
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,880
Lots happened to Jane.

361
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,510
She was taken from Arkham,

362
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,430
down, down...

363
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,976
Down... The doctor did things to her,
experiments on her and others.

364
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,979
You're talking about Hugo Strange.

365
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,523
You were taken to Indian Hill.

366
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,402
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

367
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,030
The way a chameleon
would change its skin,

368
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,490
he wanted humans to have that power.

369
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,453
He made it
so Jane could change her skin,

370
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,122
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

371
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,668
All it takes is a single touch
and her body becomes a mirror.

372
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,256
When it's done, she sheds
her skin and starts anew.

373
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,136
It remembers everyone it touched.

374
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,308
It's touched you, Detective.

375
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,105
[Gordon]
<i>We can help you, Ms. Cartwright.</i>

376
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,524
Jane Cartwright is dead.

377
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,694
She died in Arkham.

378
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,533
That's when Jane Doe was born.

379
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,954
So why kill all these cops?

380
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,834
You want to know why they died?

381
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,965
Ask your friend.

382
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,011
[rustling]

383
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,890
What is that?

384
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,026
[grunts]

385
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,320
We should head out.

386
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,072
My battery's dying. [grunts]

387
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,240
[yelling]

388
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,535
[all grunting]

389
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,163
[panting] Please.

390
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,539
He's coming. He's coming.

391
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,207
Who's coming? What happened?

392
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,333
He's going to kill me.

393
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,878
I just barely got away.

394
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,212
Are you Hank?

395
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,006
Yes.

396
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,132
[Alfred] Your wife sent us.

397
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,884
Is anyone else left alive down there?

398
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,010
They're all dead.

399
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,136
[growling]

400
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,722
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

401
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,891
Oh, God. Oh, God.

402
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,851
[growling continues]

403
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,977
Oh, my God.

404
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,699
[roaring]

405
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,869
[yelping]

406
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,747
[screaming]

407
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,253
[Alfred] Hank! Hank! Hold on, Hank!

408
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,175
[Mr. Scarface laughing]

409
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,428
Hand over the heaters.

410
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,180
If you don't mind.

411
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,098
Mr. Penn,

412
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,100
can't we just talk this through?

413
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,977
Get back!

414
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,771
I'm so sorry.

415
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,148
At least,

416
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,108
tell me what happened after Haven.

417
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,945
Help me to understand this.

418
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,198
Go on.

419
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,618
Sing your song.

420
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,747
After I was shot,

421
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,251
I woke up in the GCPD morgue.

422
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,544
I was alone.

423
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,715
I patched my wounds as
best I could and crawled out.

424
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,593
I hid in a store.

425
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,055
An abandoned magic shop.

426
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,350
That's where Mr. Scarface found me.

427
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:05,438
And he told me all about you.

428
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,775
How you used him.

429
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,319
Chewed him up and spat him out!

430
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,197
Treated him like a Toluca.

431
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,075
-That's a lie!
-Oh, please, Oswald.

432
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,493
It's what you do.

433
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,744
Arnold...

434
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,081
Arthur, what do you want?

435
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,916
I don't want anything.

436
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,670
But, Mr. Scarface, well...

437
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,423
He wants your treasure.

438
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,675
And,

439
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,801
to be boss.

440
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,053
[Penguin scoffs]

441
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,097
Really?

442
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,685
The dummy wants to be
the boss of Gotham.

443
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,811
Bingo!

444
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,314
Now, give me the key
to your treasure room.

445
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,440
Why would I do that?

446
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,150
You're obviously
gonna kill me anyway.

447
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,694
What am I doing?

448
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,488
-I'm talking to a doll.
-Dummy.

449
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,365
Seriously?

450
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,868
You know what, Oswald?
Honestly, you deserve this.

451
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,202
Nobody asked you.

452
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:06,124
You are opportunistic,
your loyalty is shaky, at best,

453
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,085
and you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

454
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,799
I hardly think you're one
to throw stones.

455
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,092
Listen, Penn...

456
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,053
Eyes down here, pal.

457
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,554
[chuckles]

458
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,680
Sorry.

459
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,807
Mr. Scarface,
I got a question for you.

460
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,933
Shoot. [laughing]

461
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,810
[Nygma chuckles]

462
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,732
After you get your tiny, wooden hands
on that treasure,

463
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
what are you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?

464
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,070
People are gonna come
after you eventually.

465
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,030
Then I'll...

466
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,449
I'll take them all on.

467
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,743
Yeah, show them who's boss!

468
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,911
Ah.

469
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,413
You wouldn't have to do that

470
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,916
if you could get off this island,
now, would you?

471
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,501
What are you doing?

472
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,754
Shut it. Let the smart one talk.

473
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,466
How do you feel

474
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,010
about submarines?

475
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,558
[Dix] What are we doing here?

476
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,396
[Harvey] I just wanted to
take us someplace quiet,

477
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,189
where we can talk.

478
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,151
We did a bad thing.

479
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,362
Oh, come on, not that again.

480
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,198
We put a killer in jail, all right?

481
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,951
What do you keep moping about?
She was guilty.

482
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,912
She got what she deserved. Drop it.

483
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,207
-Did you get what you deserved?
-What?

484
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,794
You made that girl into a murderer.

485
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,587
Oh, come on.

486
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,548
You,

487
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,675
your friends,

488
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,344
-the kid...
-Come on.

489
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,222
I'm gonna make sure
you never do that again.

490
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,974
[Dix choking]

491
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,439
Harper, where's Dix?

492
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,274
I saw Bullock take him in the back.

493
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,734
[Gordon sighs]

494
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,318
Barbara, what are you doing here?

495
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,155
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

496
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,282
before he ice-picked Harvey's pals.

497
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,117
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

498
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,493
Okay.

499
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,829
"The kid's guilty too."

500
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,164
The kid.

501
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,708
Listen,

502
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,960
what you said before,

503
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,837
about me being a known criminal...

504
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,256
I was on some list
your army buddy had.

505
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,508
When the government rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

506
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,635
Honestly, I don't know.

507
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,095
But that would work out
for you, right?

508
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,806
I go to jail, you get the baby?

509
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,349
I don't want that.

510
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,602
Is that a promise?

511
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,061
I go straight, I'm clear?

512
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,855
Stay right here.

513
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,398
Hey, Harvey.

514
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,733
Where'd you take Dix?

515
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,610
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

516
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,241
Oh, God. Oh!

517
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,288
She got into your locker,
must have taken your clothes.

518
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,415
We have to lock down the GCPD.

519
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,335
Hey, Harvey,

520
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,378
we'll find her.

521
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,422
Come on.

522
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,887
[Hank screaming]

523
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,347
[Alfred] Look at the size of it!

524
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,140
[snarling]

525
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,475
Living down here.

526
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,560
The toxins in the river
must have driven him mad.

527
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,895
Get out of here now.

528
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,104
[both grunting]

529
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,946
[Bruce groans]

530
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,925
Alfred!

531
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,306
-Stop!
-Alfred!

532
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,517
Alfred, stop.

533
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,643
Stop.

534
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,270
Stop!

535
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,608
[groaning]

536
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,656
All right, everybody, listen up.

537
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,993
GCPD is now in lockdown.

538
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,162
Nobody goes in or out
unless I say so.

539
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,832
She could look like anybody by now,
how are we supposed to find her?

540
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,626
Jim.

541
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,420
Barbara.

542
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,671
What happened?

543
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,965
What do you mean, "What happened?"
I've been attacked.

544
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,342
-Where did she go?
-Wait a minute.

545
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,721
How do we know it's really you?

546
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,889
Seriously?

547
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,892
This isn't proof enough?

548
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,394
What the hell?

549
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,230
That's her.
She's the impostor, shoot her.

550
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,481
[guns cocking]

551
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,402
It's me, you idiot.

552
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,029
That sounds like Barbara.

553
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,532
Barbara.

554
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,160
Tell me where we first met.

555
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,541
Don't shoot.

556
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,209
I'm leaving here.

557
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,046
Anyone tries to follow me, she dies.

558
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,090
Shoot her!

559
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,216
Can't risk it.

560
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,843
-Stay back!
-[grunts]

561
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,182
Bullock, wait!

562
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,852
-I'm fine.
-Take her to my office.

563
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,479
-Don't let her out of your sight.
-Okay.

564
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,872
I cannot believe that
you told him about the sub.

565
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,249
And that you're playing along
with his psychosis.

566
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,293
Obviously, he was gonna kill you.

567
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,379
I bought us time.

568
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,050
I have an idea.

569
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,970
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

570
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,221
Wait, what's the signal?

571
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,472
Quit your jawing.

572
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,100
[Mr. Penn] So,

573
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,186
Mr. Scarface and I

574
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,105
have discussed our options.

575
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,651
And the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

576
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,780
And since we'll need the smart one
to build this hay burner,

577
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,824
he can keep sucking air.

578
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,201
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

579
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,496
Do it, Penn.

580
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,665
Ventilate that mook.

581
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,878
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

582
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,631
I wish things would have
turned out differently.

583
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,757
Arthur,

584
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,093
I want you to listen
to what I'm saying.

585
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,721
You accuse me of manipulating you,
but what about him?

586
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,015
I never asked you to kill anybody.

587
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,560
-That is true.
-Hey...

588
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,730
Think of everything that
we went through together.

589
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,606
Sofia Falcone...

590
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,359
Getting cut off
from the mainland, starving.

591
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,862
You mean Penn was starving.

592
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,158
Fighting for scraps,
while your dog ate steak.

593
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,702
I welcomed you into my home.

594
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:03,249
And, yes, I was not a good friend.

595
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,834
To you or to anyone.

596
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,380
It's why I'm alone.

597
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,968
But I saw you for what you are,

598
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,387
and I valued that.

599
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,640
That must be worth something.

600
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,853
Applesauce.

601
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,939
You're a liar and a thief.

602
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,734
All you do is take,

603
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,194
take,

604
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,528
take!

605
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,489
And you never give anything.

606
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,700
You worked me to the bone.

607
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,244
Forced me to be your puppet.

608
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,539
Well, no more.

609
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,377
You hear me?

610
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,423
No more.

611
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,842
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[both groaning]

612
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,553
Take that.

613
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,888
And that!

614
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,681
[both grunting]

615
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,980
-No.
-No!

616
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,277
Mr. Cobblepot.

617
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,781
You freed me.

618
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,326
How can I ever thank you?

619
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,495
[yelping]

620
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,793
Why did you do that?

621
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,546
He wasn't the threat,
the dummy was the threat!

622
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,672
Oswald...

623
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,676
I accept you
for the person that you are.

624
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,429
Just as you accept me
for the cold logician that I am.

625
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,267
That's why this friendship is great.

626
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,686
And as friends,

627
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,523
I think we can both agree that
that lunatic had to be stopped.

628
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,109
[laughing]

629
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,906
Perhaps, Edward,

630
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,742
we really are meant for each other.

631
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,287
[both laughing]

632
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,723
Jane.

633
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,479
I know you're up here.

634
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,748
Jane, I knew you'd be here.

635
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm sorry.

636
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,339
It was my job to protect you
and I let you down.

637
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,259
You made Jane into a killer.

638
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,513
You and your friends,
there have to be consequences.

639
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,892
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

640
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,853
When you're dead.

641
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,773
Put the gun down!

642
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,274
Shoot me.

643
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,655
You killed Jane years ago,
and you didn't even know it.

644
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,240
Just shoot me.

645
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,333
Let me see your face.

646
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,503
Your real face.

647
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,966
Why? So you can see
what a monster she is?

648
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,471
Hugo Strange only destroyed her face,

649
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,890
you destroyed her soul.

650
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,728
Let me see it.

651
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,962
[Jane] You see?

652
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,632
Do you see what they did?

653
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,723
Jane...

654
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,602
We can work this out,
just put the gun down.

655
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,772
The only way this ends
is with one of us dead.

656
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,667
Oh, Hank, thank God you're alive.

657
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,087
The nurse thinks the man
that attacked us will never recover.

658
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,382
The toxins in the river have done
irreparable damage to his brain.

659
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,176
I just think it's a shame
we couldn't save

660
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,511
the rest of the people
that went missing, Master Bruce.

661
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,556
We should have went to
Gordon from the start.

662
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,725
-We were reckless.
-That's nonsense.

663
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,561
We took decisive action,
we saved a man's life.

664
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,146
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce,

665
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,982
they need someone
that will protect them.

666
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,943
I agree.

667
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,073
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

668
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,994
I don't follow.

669
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,122
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

670
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,334
I know you've been blaming yourself.

671
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,921
You didn't destroy our home, Alfred.

672
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,297
But I feel like I did.

673
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:49,053
I feel like I wasn't strong enough to
fight Tetch and that bastard Valeska.

674
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,932
I feel like because of my weakness,

675
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,809
you lost your last tie to the past.

676
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,438
You lost your home, Master Bruce.

677
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,944
I must never be that weak again.

678
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,741
Part of being a family

679
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,160
is that we can be strong
for each other.

680
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,127
And when did you get so smart?

681
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,629
I had a good teacher.

682
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,511
Victoria Cartwright killed
her husband.

683
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,515
After we arrested her,
she admitted it.

684
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,392
Later, she recanted.

685
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,728
But the physical evidence
wasn't there.

686
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,731
I was a new cop,
I wanted to make detective.

687
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,024
So, you leaned on Jane.

688
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,862
Forced a statement out of her
to put her mother away.

689
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,282
The woman was guilty.

690
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,577
Later, I found out the husband...

691
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,997
Beat the mother and Jane.

692
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,708
I didn't know till after.

693
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,339
Bartender overheard Jane
say something about...

694
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,716
"The kid's guilty, too."

695
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,678
She meant the young cop.

696
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,972
She meant you.

697
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,143
I knew something was wrong.

698
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,563
I felt it.

699
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,775
I said something, and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

700
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,195
just close the case, put a bow on it.

701
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,201
After a while, I stopped feeling it.

702
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,538
I went down that path
for a long time,

703
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,081
until I met you.

704
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,088
However much I've changed,

705
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,258
I can't change the past.

706
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,054
I made that girl a killer.

707
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,600
What do you want from me, Harvey?

708
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,645
Forgiveness?

709
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,233
Can't give that to you.

710
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,029
I just needed you to know.
