1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,800
Cactus 1549.
Runway four. Cleared for takeoff.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,360
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Mayday. Mayday. Cactus 1549.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
We've lost both engines.
Both engines.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
- No re-light on one or two.
- Cactus 1549...

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,576
if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,880
Departure control, we can make it.
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,560
LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,240
Sully, we're too low.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,160
- Sully, we're too low!
- Come on.

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,120
Just a little farther.

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,360
Come on.

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,200
- Sully!
- Lorrie, I love you.

14
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,640
What the hell's the matter with you?

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,880
The onboard count, 150 passengers...

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,880
3 flight attendants and 2 pilots...

17
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,600
one of whom the senior pilot, drew on

18
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
all of his experience and skill...

19
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
which combined with
near-miraculous good luck...

20
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,600
and a result that was,
frankly, astounding.

21
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
There were some
non-critical injuries...

22
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,920
but everyone, everyone, survived.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,960
The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
You think that you're gonna die.
That's what you think.

25
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,120
And then, miraculously, you don't.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you, Captain.

27
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Thank you.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,120
Okay, thank you, everybody,
thank you.

29
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,296
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

30
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,520
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

31
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm glad you could make it
in this morning.

32
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,440
Not as glad as we are.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,296
For the record,
we had an Aircraft Systems Team...

34
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,000
on this investigation.
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT...

35
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,720
Aircraft Performance, ATC...

36
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,880
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

37
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
Today, we begin with
our operation and...

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,920
human performance investigation
on the crash...

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,760
- of US Airways Flight 1549.
- Water landing.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,720
- Captain?
- This was not a crash...

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
and it wasn't a ditching.

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,160
We knew what we're trying
to execute here. It was not a...

43
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,760
It's not a crash.
It's a forced water landing.

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,360
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

45
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,880
There simply was not enough altitude.

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,280
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough...

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,376
and smooth enough and wide enough
to even attempt to land...

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,176
- the airplane safely.
- Air Traffic testified...

49
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,840
that you stated you're returning
to LaGuardia, but you did not.

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,560
As I began the left turn...

51
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,920
I realized I couldn't make it back
and it would've eliminated...

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,880
all the other options.
Returning to LaGuardia...

53
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,616
- would've been a mistake.
- Okay, well, let's get into...

54
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,280
how you calculated
all those parameters.

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
There was no time for calculating.

56
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,680
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude...

57
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,480
and speed of thousands of flights
over four decades.

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,280
- You're saying you didn't do any...
- I eyeballed it.

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
You eyeballed it?

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
Yes.

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,160
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
And I'd bet my life on it.
In fact, I did.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,640
And I'd do it again.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Aviation engineers are theorizing...

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,440
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

66
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,120
Well, engineers are not pilots.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,840
They're wrong.

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,600
And they weren't there.

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
Regardless, we've to follow up
on all implications...

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
as part of our investigation.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,400
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

73
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,000
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

74
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,000
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
I'd like to oversee
those computer simulations.

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,680
Not possible during an investigation.

77
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,000
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure...

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,600
due to multiple bird strikes?

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
That would be unprecedented.

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
How much sleep
did you get the night before?

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
Eight hours. Enough.

83
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,600
Is it possible
your blood sugar was low?

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,000
I was rested, alert and
completely aware of my surroundings.

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,736
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,800
- Nine days ago.
- Drugs?

87
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
No. Never.

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
First Officer Skiles?

89
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,840
Don't drink. Never have.

90
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
Captain...

91
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,720
have you had any troubles
at home lately?

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,640
No more than anyone else.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
And nothing that affected my work.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
It's bullshit.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,136
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong...

96
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,376
- when it all turned out right?
- It didn't turn out alright...

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,240
for the airline
and their insurance company.

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,760
We should expect some blowback.
Come on, Mike.

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,136
What are they gonna say?
That he shouldn't have...

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,040
- saved everybody?
- It's not personal.

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
NTSB's just doing its job.

102
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,680
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

103
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,720
Sully, they should pin on
the medal and send you back to work.

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
- Sorry. This mailbox is full.
- I didn't call Lorrie...

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,920
since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
Not meaning to bother,
but I've to say...

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
it is an honor driving you today.

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
Thank you.

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,320
What has it been this year so far?

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,080
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.
Many million new people with no work.

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,600
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,600
Friday's headline? This is beautiful.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Hey, Mike. How about we add
the driver as a character witness?

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
- Finally!
- Yeah, finally.

115
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,600
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

116
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,200
I know. I just...

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,600
I just needed to hear your voice.
I've been hearing everybody else's.

118
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,040
You'd be amazed
how many cousins you have.

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,760
It doesn't feel much
like family here.

120
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,720
Pretty quiet here, too.

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
The reporters want me
to give an update...

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,400
inside the mind of Sully.

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,640
- What should I tell them?
- Lorrie tell them you're...

124
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,016
- not allowed to talk to anybody.
- Look, I can't.

125
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,336
- I can't hear you. I really...
- Lorrie...

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,296
- I can't hear you. Call me back.
- I'm trying to tell you...

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,896
- you do not have to talk to anybody.
- Call...

128
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
- I can't hear you. Call me back.
- Lorrie, just...

129
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm trying to tell...

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,440
- Captain Sully!
- Sully!

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,376
How does it feel to be
a miracle maker?

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
Sully, one question!

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
How did you pull off the impossible?

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
- Sully.
- Captain Sully!

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,200
- Sally, one more word.
- Captain Sully.

136
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Pardon me. Excuse me.

137
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
- How does it feel to be a hero?
- Captain Sully!

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,080
I'm thinking about running over
the press with the car.

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,120
Self-defense.
You think a jury would convict?

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,040
- Just do what you've to do.
- I'm taking that as permission.

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
The cops'll be coming after you.

142
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,936
- Sullenberger couldn't be here.
- I've never seen anything...

143
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,336
- like this. They're blocking
- He is not able...

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,656
- to speak to the media...
- the entire street.

145
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,616
- While the NTSB is conducting...
- And the neighbors are furious...

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,520
- its investigation.
- Concerned, but furious...

147
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Sully, are you listening to me?

148
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Maybe we should talk later.

149
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,920
Honey, it is later.
I've been waiting all day.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,440
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just tired, that's all.

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
How are the girls?

152
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
Well, they're...

153
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,960
They're a little overwhelmed.
It sounds like you are, too.

154
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,800
Yeah...

155
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeah, well, they'll be alright.

156
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
- It is a lot.
- Yes, it is.

157
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,760
Those missing engines were definitely
not what investigators wanted...

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
The whole world is talking about you.

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
My Sully.

160
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,440
- God, I just can't believe this.
- Lorrie...

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,440
I've to stay here longer...

162
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,160
for the NTSB investigation.
Did I tell you that already?

163
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,840
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,960
There's no need for you to apologize.

165
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,920
You're right where you need to be.

166
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,880
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

167
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Of course you did.

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,560
You saved everyone.

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,480
Maybe we should
just talk in the morning.

170
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm tired.

171
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm overwhelmed
by all this attention.

172
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,880
I'm gonna be on TV in the morning.
What are they gonna ask me?

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,416
- What am I gonna say?
- Sully, do you want me...

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
to come be with you?

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,000
No, Lorrie.

176
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,640
Thanks, but the girls need you.

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,960
Tell them I love them.

178
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
I love you. Get some sleep.

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah. Hey, maybe when I wake up...

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,040
it'll be January 14th.
Wouldn't that be good?

181
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,560
I love you.

182
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,520
Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision...

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,080
to turn the Hudson into a runway?

184
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,880
Well, only he can answer.

185
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,520
But we now know
it was the wrong choice.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,680
A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those onboard.

187
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,200
So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero...

188
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,200
this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding...

189
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,840
of the so-called
"Miracle on the Hudson."

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,280
Sully Sullenberger, are you...

191
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,120
a hero or a fraud?

192
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,160
- Hello?
- Jeff? I'm sorry to call so late.

193
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,880
It's okay. There's no sleep
in this room either.

194
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,080
Can you believe they charge
five dollars for a Snickers?

195
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,480
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,840
Just thought maybe you'd want to...

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,640
Talk? Absolutely.

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,320
Let's get some air.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
Great.

200
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Alright. Be down there
in five minutes.

201
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,160
You enjoying the shakes?

202
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,200
- The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.
- A little bit.

203
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,720
Union's offering us counseling.

204
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah. What are they gonna say?

205
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
"You were in a plane crash
and lived."

206
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

207
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,080
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

208
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,400
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

209
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,616
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing...

210
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,960
about how we got to meet
David Letterman.

211
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
We're doing David Letterman?

212
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah. Right after
the next NTSB interview.

213
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
- Letterman.
- I'm guessing...

214
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,160
Dave is gonna be slightly funnier.

215
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,880
This is so surreal.

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,376
I guess I'm having
a little trouble...

217
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,440
separating reality
from whatever the hell this is.

218
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah. This is two men
freezing their asses off.

219
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,520
Sully...

220
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
don't worry. You did a great thing.

221
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,920
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,720
Here's the funny thing.

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,840
I've delivered a million passengers
over forty years in the air...

224
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
but in the end,
I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

225
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,840
Come on. Tomorrow's
gonna be a good day.

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,720
Computer Sims
will prove you're right.

227
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,600
We can all put our wings back on.

228
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,280
- You wanna run?
- Yeah, let's run.

229
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
F♪♪king cold out here.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,360
It was obvious.
It was a critical situation...

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,760
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude...

232
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,920
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

233
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
But choosing to land on the Hudson...

234
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
that was still a big "if".

235
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,560
I was sure I could do it.

236
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
You were?

237
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes.

238
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,560
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

239
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,880
I don't feel like a hero.

240
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

241
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,960
The right man for the job
at the right time.

242
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,000
You've been flying for what,
nearly forty years?

243
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,320
Forty-two. It's been my life.

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,440
My whole life.

245
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,480
Your aircraft.

246
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,000
My aircraft.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

248
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
So, you can take the plane up,
I guess, when you please.

249
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,920
Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

250
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,960
A pilot never stops
acquiring knowledge.

251
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,680
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.

252
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
- Just learn from them.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,160
And never forget,
no matter what's happening...

254
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,200
- to fly the airplane.
- Absolutely, sir.

255
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
One other thing,
and this is important.

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,600
- Sir?
- You can go ahead and smile.

257
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
Alright.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,600
- I apologize for the perspiration.
- No.

259
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,136
After what you did,
I'd think that Katie...

260
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,640
- couldn't be too intimidating.
- It wasn't Katie.

261
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,400
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

262
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay. All done.

263
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,840
That was from my mom.

264
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,120
Her name is Brenda,
she says to say "thank you"...

265
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,920
- and that she's single.
- Well, you tell Brenda thank you...

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,520
but I've got a girl at home.

267
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Lucky woman.

268
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,600
Thank you.

269
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,120
Sully.

270
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,960
Sully.

271
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,920
Sully, where are you?

272
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm standing here calling your name.

273
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,800
What's up with you?

274
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,000
You need to get focused.

275
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,960
Because the media
request avalanche continues.

276
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah.

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,616
Larry Rooney
volunteered to jump in...

278
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,000
and ride shotgun with you
the rest of the way.

279
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Thought you might need a friend.

280
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
He'll take you
to today's NTSB meeting.

281
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Airbus completed
their computer simulations as well.

282
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
- Good, that'll help.
- There's something else.

283
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,000
Arnie Gentile called.

284
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,720
He has the ACARS data.

285
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

286
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,960
Not possible. I felt it go.

287
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,800
It was like we're stopped in midair.

288
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,320
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle...

289
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,320
that it still could've had thrust.

290
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

291
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,640
Captain Sully!

292
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
Is retirement next?

293
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,800
Can we get a photo, Sully?

294
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,520
What's next for you? What's next?

295
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,080
Some room, please.

296
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,120
Sully! Over here!

297
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey, Larry.
Good to see a friendly face.

298
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Might be the last one you see today.

299
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,936
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

300
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,000
Look, I'm sorry
if you're frustrated, but our job...

301
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,840
is to investigate how a plane
ended up in the Hudson River.

302
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
On the Hudson River.

303
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

304
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,600
Seeking the facts is hardly...

305
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
- "fishing," Mr Skiles.
- Okay...

306
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
then here's the most important fact.

307
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,616
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit...

308
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,840
- that day and I'm one of them.
- And we appreciate your perspective.

309
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
Why do you even think
we're here today?

310
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,880
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

311
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,080
Look, I just finished training
on the A320 and I can tell you...

312
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,216
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did...

313
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
that the aircraft
could land anywhere...

314
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,416
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on...

315
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,400
- the Auxiliary Power Unit.
- He was simply...

316
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,320
- following the QRH.
- No. He wasn't.

317
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,936
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

318
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,720
And I know,
because I had the QRH in my hands.

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

320
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,976
According to Airbus,
that's the fifteenth thing...

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
on the list to do. Fifteenth.

322
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,360
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

323
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,040
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

324
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,240
You're not used to having answers
to your guesses.

325
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,960
Look, what Jeff is saying...

326
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,160
is that I know the A320,
what it does and what it doesn't do.

327
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
I've read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots...

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,760
and I have significant accident
investigation experience.

329
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,800
There is no question
that you're a talented...

330
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,080
dedicated, experienced professional.

331
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,680
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th...

332
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,816
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview...

333
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
of this investigation.

334
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,360
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

335
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,000
Your union has been advised.

336
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,760
ACARS data relayed that
the left engine...

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,920
continued to turn
throughout the flight.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

339
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
The evidence shows that
the left engine...

340
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,720
was at idle
or sub-idle immediately...

341
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,016
- following the bird strike.
- You show me the left engine...

342
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
I'll show you dead birds
and no power.

343
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,320
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

344
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
But we can circle back to that later.

345
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,480
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say...

346
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,040
a dual engine loss
due to bird strike.

347
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,280
Your weight was 151,510 pounds...

348
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
wind and temperature north,
northwest, twenty one degrees.

349
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Speed and altitude
two hundred knots at 2,818 feet.

350
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
- Agree?
- Correct.

351
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,600
We're able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

352
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,840
And the resulting
computer simulations...

353
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,040
of US Airways Flight 1549...

354
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,200
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

355
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike...

356
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,040
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

357
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,080
- Successful?
- The plane landed at LaGuardia.

358
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,760
Intact.

359
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,640
- Undamaged.
- You got that...

360
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
from one computer simulation?

361
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
No.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,720
- From twenty.
- Including attempts...

363
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,400
made for Teterboro runways 1-9
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

364
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters...

365
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,600
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

366
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,840
And not just possible, probable.

367
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,640
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

368
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Captain Sullenberger?

369
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,800
First Officer Skiles?

370
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,680
Not at this time.

371
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
I'd like to go over
the parameters that were used.

372
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
We'll make them available
to the union.

373
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,320
- Thank you.
- And once...

374
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
the investigation is complete...

375
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,560
we'll be able to share
the actual computer simulations.

376
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
For now, they remain confidential.

377
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,280
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

378
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,840
There's been far too much
talk in the press already.

379
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,160
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled...

380
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,880
along with ATC and
all onboard transcripts combined...

381
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,600
we will call you back.

382
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

383
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,200
Thank you.

384
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,040
They're playing Pacman. You're flying
a plane full of human beings.

385
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,040
Somehow,
that's not how I remember it.

386
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,800
- It just doesn't seem right.
- It's because it's not right.

387
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,120
Sully, you did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

388
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,960
Ask the passengers.
Ask your wife and kids. Ask mine.

389
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So what was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

390
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,200
- "Brace for impact." Yes.
- "Brace for impact."

391
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,920
Now, ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,800
No, not ever.

393
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,800
Ever hear that in any other aspect
of your lives?

394
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
I don't know.

395
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,760
I don't know.

396
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,920
They could take this show away
from me.

397
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,400
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

398
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

399
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,600
Are they paying you
for all this media stuff at least?

400
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,960
It's news, Lorr.
No payment is necessary.

401
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,640
I wish the bank felt the same way.

402
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,120
Why? What do you mean?

403
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
It's just...

404
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,360
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

405
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,080
We'll find a tenant.
It just takes time.

406
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,320
Yeah, you've been saying that
for nine months, Sully.

407
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,920
- It's still vacant.
- The economy has to take a turn.

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,240
It feels like if we lose that space
the next domino to fall is the house.

409
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,000
Lorr, we're not gonna lose the house.

410
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm sorry. I'm just anxious and...

412
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,080
I'm alone and not enough sleep.

413
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Yeah, I know. Not a lot of sleep
going on here either.

414
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,960
I'm sorry
if I'm adding to your stress.

415
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,880
But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon.

416
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,520
Not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,760
- We need you flying.
- Lorr, if this goes badly...

418
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,560
my career as a safety expert...

419
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,840
will end as a website
and a business card.

420
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

421
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,320
What if I did blow this?

422
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,960
What are you saying?

423
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,720
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

424
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,400
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

425
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,560
Sully, watch the news.

426
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
You're a hero.

427
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,800
Everyone's gonna have to
get used to it, including the NTSB.

428
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,840
Worst case scenario...

429
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,640
the NTSB lists me
as the probable cause.

430
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,560
That's immediate retirement.
No pension.

431
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,680
- My life's work gone.
- Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.

432
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
What is going on?

433
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,120
The left engine
might've still been idling.

434
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,880
And the Airbus simulations say...

435
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,560
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,560
But that doesn't make sense.
Doesn't jibe with...

437
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,160
everything I felt in the cockpit.

438
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,280
Then why did you do it, Sully?

439
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,080
What, land in the water?

440
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,400
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could've done?

441
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

442
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,280
The tuna basil
or the ham and cheddar?

443
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Tuna basil, Mr Sully. Very fresh.

444
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

445
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
Too cold today. Too much cold.

446
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,760
When are you gonna come fly with me?

447
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,680
When US Air starts flights
to Hyderabad.

448
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
I'll talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.

449
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
- For heaven's sakes, Diane!
- No!

450
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,280
- It's his birthday!
- Come on!

451
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,280
- Just a little something.
- No, Mom!

452
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,840
The suitcase's already overstuffed...

453
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,456
- with gifts for Will.
- It's always fun...

454
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,040
to get something from the airport.

455
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,680
Feels like you've traveled, too.

456
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,600
Ma, he's turning one.

457
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,936
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

458
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,800
But I will.

459
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,760
Maybe a snow globe.

460
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Something he'll remember.

461
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,256
- Something "New York".
- Were you this generous...

462
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,880
- when we're kids?
- Okay, sweetheart.

463
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,280
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

464
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
Fine. Come on.

465
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,320
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

466
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,760
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

467
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,200
- Jeff.
- Hey, Sully. How are ya?

468
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,160
- Sorry. Come on!
- Excuse me.

469
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,640
Hey, guys! Jeff!

470
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,336
- We're not gonna make it!
- I've been waiting for a year...

471
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,776
for this trip, Dad. I'm not
gonna miss this flight.

472
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

473
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,320
We'll see you there, Uncle Robbie.

474
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,920
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,200
3-0-2-3.

476
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,080
Start checklist complete.

477
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,200
You really think they'll release us?

478
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,080
Checked the latest reports.
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

479
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Then steaks. Del Frisco's. On me.

480
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,760
Never been.

481
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
And I hear good things.

482
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,160
The rib eye'll break your heart.

483
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm more of a porterhouse man.

484
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,000
The porterhouse will stop your heart.

485
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,400
We're now closed
for US Airways flight 1549...

486
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,776
- service to Charlotte...
- Wait, wait!

487
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,240
- You got it.
- Wait.

488
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
Hi. I'm sorry.

489
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
Spirit sent us. We got canceled...

490
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,816
and they said that we're re-routed.

491
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,160
- That you guys had some seats?
- Flight is closed.

492
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Wait. See that old guy
limping up right there?

493
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,096
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's gotta be on this flight.

494
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,040
What kind of emergency?

495
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,480
- Golf emergency.
- This flight canceled?

496
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,040
Oughta be.

497
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,440
- ID's please.
- Oh, my God!

498
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,800
How many people are traveling?

499
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,400
- Three. Thank you.
- Nothing together.

500
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,800
That's alright.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

501
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,960
Here we go. 22A...

502
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,560
6A...

503
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,360
- and 6C.
- Thank you.

504
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,720
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

505
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,040
- Thank you.
- Yes!

506
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,800
- Happy ending.
- What!

507
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,400
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard!

508
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,040
- Welcome aboard.
- How's it going?

509
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,080
- Lucky you made it. Alright.
- Yeah, no kidding.

510
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,880
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Thank you!

511
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,800
- We're in six, Jeff.
- No. That's all Jimmy.

512
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,416
I was up till 3.00.
I gotta get some sleep.

513
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,680
- You can sleep here.
- No. Not with you verbally...

514
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,256
- running the course the whole time.
- I think I'll play...

515
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,616
- the seven iron on the 9th.
- Yeah.

516
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,400
No. Good night.

517
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,160
Sorry. Excuse me.

518
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,080
Here. There you go.

519
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,760
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

520
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Hey, guys, I'm in here.

521
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm so sorry.

522
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,696
- He likes to throw everything.
- That's perfect.

523
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,680
I like to catch everything.

524
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,400
Hey, little man.

525
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
I googled you last night.

526
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,320
Read all about your company
on your website.

527
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,720
It's impressive.

528
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,120
Thanks.

529
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,640
I thought I was
a good bullshitter, but you?

530
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
You could go pro.

531
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,640
- Hey.
- No. I'm only teasing.

532
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,416
Well, I mean,
the site does make it sound like...

533
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,216
your air safety consulting business
has got about a hundred employees...

534
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,800
and headquarters in three states.

535
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,920
Then when I dug a little deeper,
I realized it's only you.

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,920
Well, go easy.

537
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm just getting it going.

538
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

539
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,960
Nah. Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

540
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,720
Off that website? I'd hire you.

541
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,400
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

542
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,040
Welcome onboard
US Airways Flight 1549...

543
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
with service to Charlotte.

544
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,056
Please review
the safety instruction card...

545
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
in the seatback pocket
in front of you.

546
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,120
It explains the safety features
of this aircraft...

547
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices.

548
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,040
Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device.

549
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,160
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

550
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,160
Cactus 1549, gate 21 cleared to push.

551
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,160
Spot 28, ground for taxi.

552
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,520
Be sure you turn that off.

553
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,360
Tray table up.

554
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,160
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

555
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,576
Well, you know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

556
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
Yeah, what's that?

557
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,760
Fly out of JFK.

558
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,440
Funny.

559
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,160
Takeoff minimum fuel quantity verify.

560
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,480
19,000 pounds required.

561
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,920
We got 21.8 onboard.

562
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,760
19,000 pounds required. 21.8 onboard.

563
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,120
Cactus 1549. Runway 4.
Cleared for takeoff.

564
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,560
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

565
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,360
- TO-GA.
- TO-GA set.

566
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,200
Positive rate.

567
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
Gear up, please.

568
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
Gear up.

569
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Nice view of the Hudson.

570
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,520
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

571
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,360
Life's easier in the air.

572
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
I guess it is.

573
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,640
Birds!

574
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,280
Shit.

575
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,320
Yeah.

576
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
- It's just turbulence, probably.
- I'll check the cabin.

577
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,080
What do you think's going on?

578
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,520
It's okay.

579
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,400
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

580
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
We got one rolling back.

581
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,280
We've both of them rolling back.

582
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,120
Ignition start.

583
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,760
Oh, my God.

584
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm starting the APU.

585
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,640
Just double-check your seat belts,
please.

586
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,136
- Seat belt. Relax.
- Can I make sure your seatbelts...

587
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,456
- are fastened?
- Make sure your seat belts...

588
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,720
are fastened.

589
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,240
Seat belts.

590
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,800
- What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

591
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,600
- Then we're going back to LaGuardia.
- Yeah.

592
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
Get out the QRH.

593
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,560
- Priority left.
- Loss of thrust on both engines.

594
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
Mayday. This is Cactus 1549.
We hit birds.

595
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,880
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

596
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,280
We've lost thrust on both engines.
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

597
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,480
Okay, you need to
return to LaGuardia?

598
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

599
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,080
Which engine did you lose?

600
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,240
- Both. Both engines.
- Supe?

601
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,280
- Yeah?
- I've an emergency.

602
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
- What's the report?
- Both engines.

603
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
- What?
- Both engines gone. No thrust.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,680
Alright. LaGuardia
says go to runway 1-3.

605
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

606
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,800
1549, bird strike.

607
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,680
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

608
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,360
- Which engine?
- He lost thrust in both engines...

609
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,680
he said.

610
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,480
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you...

611
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,720
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

612
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,160
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

613
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
I got an A320 diving for the river.

614
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,600
Al, stack all the inbounds
to LaGuardia.

615
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's put a hold on the tower,
please.

616
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,656
- Come on, guys, stay on point.
- What about over to our right?

617
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,920
Anything in New Jersey?
Maybe Teterboro?

618
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,320
Teterboro tower, I need a runway.

619
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,256
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

620
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,016
- Newark tower, what have you got?
- You've runway...

621
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,336
2-9 cleared and ready. You need...

622
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,640
- emergency landing?
- Yes.

623
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,680
Okay, yeah. Off your right side
is Teterboro airport.

624
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,080
Shit.

625
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,080
This is the Captain.

626
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,280
- Brace for impact.
- Oh, my God.

627
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,320
- What?
- Brace.

628
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,120
Heads down, stay down!

629
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,360
Brace.

630
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,680
Heads down, stay down!

631
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,720
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

632
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
- You can land runway one Teterboro.
- We can't make it.

633
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,480
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

634
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

635
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,960
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

636
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,480
KC, come on over here.

637
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,880
You also got Newark off your
two o'clock in about seven miles.

638
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't go in the river.

639
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,360
- Sir?
- Plug in.

640
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
Cactus 1549, if you can...

641
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,680
you got runway 2-9
available at Newark.

642
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,080
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

643
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
Come on.

644
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,600
Please, God.

645
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
- I'm sorry, Patrick.
- No. He's inbound...

646
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,376
to Newark I know it.
He just went off the box...

647
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,640
- to focus.
- Patty.

648
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,080
He'll come back up.

649
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,120
He's heading to Teterboro.

650
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
We need other eyes and ears.

651
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,680
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

652
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,576
When we come up
around this bend up here...

653
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,240
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

654
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,696
- It's one of New York's...
- We got an A320...

655
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,200
on emergency descent.
Cactus 1549...

656
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,000
is low level above the Hudson.

657
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,680
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

658
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,280
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.
I'm staying on this.

659
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,120
He's out there.

660
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.

661
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
It's only seven miles.

662
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,440
Cactus 1549,
this is departure control.

663
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,440
On guard, do you read?

664
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,040
He's going down.

665
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

666
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Shit! He's going down!

667
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,800
He's gonna hit the water.

668
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,320
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

669
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,720
Tester's gonna come down.

670
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,280
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

671
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
His voice was so calm.

672
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

673
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,560
This isn't happening.

674
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,320
People don't survive water landings,
Henry.

675
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Pull up.

676
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,960
Pull up.

677
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,360
- Pull up.
- We're gonna brace.

678
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,120
- Pull up!
- Thirty.

679
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
- Pull up!
- Twenty.

680
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,000
- Pull up.
- Ten.

681
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,000
I'd better go.

682
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,480
I'm so sorry. I love you.

683
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
Yeah. I gotta go.

684
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,080
Just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport...

685
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
bound for Charlotte,
North Carolina...

686
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,000
and then a mid-air disaster
struck US Airways Flight 1549.

687
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,920
It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.

688
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,400
The pilot quickly realized...

689
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,600
he could not return
to the airport and land.

690
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,640
His options severely limited...

691
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,320
the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River.

692
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,960
Choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was a big "if".

693
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,880
Have you had any troubles
at home lately?

694
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,440
Why'd you do it, Sully?
Land in the water?

695
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,776
Sully, you did everything you could.
It was more than enough.

696
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,280
Every computer simulation...

697
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
demonstrated that
a return was possible.

698
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,320
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

699
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,280
There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

700
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,080
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

701
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,480
This is Tasty 1-1.
Abort test bombing run.

702
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,320
I've an emergency
flight control malfunction.

703
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,760
- Two, join on me.
- Roger that. Two joining on you.

704
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,120
- Damn it. Feels like hydraulics.
- Sir, do we need to punch out?

705
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,160
No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.

706
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,800
- Get the checklist.
- We've the checklist, sir.

707
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,480
Increasing thrust. We need altitude.

708
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,400
Hold on, we're gonna climb.

709
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,160
Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 1-1...

710
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,576
with an emergency
flight control malfunction.

711
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,320
We need a straight-in approach.

712
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,280
Roger, Tasty 1-1. Turn left 2-0-0...

713
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
- to runway 3.
- Unable.

714
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,720
I repeat,
I need a straight-in approach.

715
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,200
Okay. Proceed straight
ahead to runway 2-1.

716
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,240
2-1, Tasty 1-1.

717
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,320
Two, I'm decreasing speed.

718
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
Clear the board for a damage check.

719
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,680
One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.

720
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,120
Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.

721
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,880
One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.

722
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,800
I've visual on the runway.
What's our heading?

723
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,840
Heading 0-2-0. Five miles out, sir.

724
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,200
Alright. Gear in three.

725
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,560
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.
Looks like you're coming in hot.

726
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,720
Nellis Tower,
I need speed to maintain control.

727
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,320
Avoiding a stall.

728
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,120
One, check your heading.
You're not gonna make the runway.

729
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,080
I got it. I'm bringing her back.

730
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,520
That was a hell of a landing, sir.

731
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,560
I didn't think we're gonna make it.

732
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,056
I'm gonna start charging you
for this stuff...

733
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,480
- alright?
- Get out of here.

734
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,880
- You hear me?
- You got any nuts?

735
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,280
US Airways Flight 1549...

736
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,640
- Hey.
- Hudson River...

737
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Unbelievable.

738
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,880
But what still seems so hard
to believe...

739
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,520
is that everyone
aboard the plane survived...

740
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,520
including two shivering babies...

741
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,160
- who were found in a life raft.
- Hey.

742
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,760
Is that you?

743
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,240
- Are you the pilot? Sully?
- Yep.

744
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,280
- That is you, right?
- Yeah.

745
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,640
Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.
That was...

746
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,480
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

747
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,800
- That was really something. It's...
- Yeah, he's a hero.

748
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,920
A real pleasure to meet you.
You know, we...

749
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,480
We invented a drink after you
as soon as that happened.

750
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,360
- Ain't that right, Johnny?
- Yeah, you did.

751
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,120
In fact, I'll take one.

752
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,120
The Sully!
It's a shot of Grey Goose...

753
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,360
with a splash of water.

754
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,160
Splash of water.

755
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,440
Hey, listen.

756
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,120
To January 15th.

757
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,720
Best day of the year.

758
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,160
- To Sully.
- Sully.

759
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,160
Too surreal to believe.

760
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,200
The Mayor plans to honor
the plane's pilot...

761
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,576
- Chesley Sully Sullenberger with...
- Hey, Pete.

762
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,856
- A key to the City.
- Sully's here...

763
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,256
- At that moment...
- and he's there!

764
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,840
- Damn, Pete. He's everywhere!
- Sullenberger...

765
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,600
Yeah! Sully!

766
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,720
You're like a real hero, man.
You know that?

767
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

768
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,560
Agreed.

769
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,160
Twenty-one people onboard, Cap.

770
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,400
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

771
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,280
- Alright, thanks. Roger that.
- Alright.

772
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,360
Twenty-one on the TJ,
departing Midtown, slip Seven.

773
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,040
Unbelievable.

774
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,880
I cannot believe
you've the sack to say that.

775
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,856
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

776
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,440
I'll say it again.
Dennis Eckersley...

777
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,296
is without question
the greatest relief pitcher...

778
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,680
in the history of baseball.
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

779
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,120
Is that what it is? Or is it...

780
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,760
- the mustache?
- You're just jealous...

781
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
- he was never a Yankee.
- Jealous?

782
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,720
- Please.
- Yeah.

783
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,240
Now, let's turn to page seven,
we can look at asset...

784
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,160
- Pull up.
- Brace.

785
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,720
- Heads down, stay down!
- Let me hold him.

786
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,720
- Brace.
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

787
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,560
Heads down, stay down!

788
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,840
- Brace.
- [Russian]

789
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,256
- Head down.
- We're not gonna make it...

790
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,560
- Stay down!
- Uncle Robbie.

791
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,960
- Brace.
- I love you, Mom.

792
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
- Heads down, stay down!
- To the moon and the stars...

793
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,656
- and all the way back.
- And all the way back.

794
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,440
Heads down, stay down!

795
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,640
What do we do, darling?

796
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,680
Hi, sweetheart.

797
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,840
Oh, my God.

798
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,920
Evacuate.

799
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,800
- Evacuate.
- Come on...

800
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,320
Grab your life vests, please.

801
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,976
- Opening forward door.
- Life vest is under your seats.

802
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,560
Do not inflate.

803
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,920
It's flooding back here!

804
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,400
Rob Kolodjay!

805
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,320
- Jeff!
- Go!

806
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,120
Everyone! The aft exits are unusable.

807
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,600
Move forward to the overwing exits!

808
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,120
And don life vests now!

809
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,080
Come on.

810
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,680
Go! Exit! Go!

811
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,520
Move forward. Move forward...

812
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,096
- to the right or left exit door.
- Jeff!

813
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,800
He's back there, can you see him?

814
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,280
Dad!

815
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,800
Stay calm.

816
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,360
Go slowly.

817
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,160
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump!

818
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,760
Sir, evacuate the plane
right now! Go!

819
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,160
Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.

820
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,280
Sir! Come back, sir!

821
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,200
Calm down. You'll be fine.

822
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,680
The rafts are waiting.

823
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,600
Deploy vests outside.

824
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,320
No air on the inside of the plane.

825
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,920
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Here, it's gonna...

826
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,920
It's gonna be bitter out there.
Here you go.

827
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,560
Here. Gonna be bitter out there.

828
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,200
- Slowly.
- You need to get off...

829
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,576
- Please sir. Slide...
- this plane now.

830
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,920
Slowly and gently.

831
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
- Plenty of room.
- Come on, people. Move.

832
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,320
- Okay. It's good now. Jump.
- We're sinking!

833
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,880
Oh, my God. Is that gas?

834
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,200
We've to jump.

835
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,160
No. Wait!

836
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,880
Oh, my God.

837
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,160
- You seeing this?
- Yeah. Holy Christ, that's a plane.

838
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,280
Deploy that man overboard ladder
right away.

839
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,240
- Alright, I'm on it.
- Shit.

840
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,720
Mayday. Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.

841
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,600
We've a passenger airliner
in the north river.

842
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,040
We're en route. We'll advise.

843
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,960
Let's go.

844
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,840
You're all fired up!

845
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,080
Jimmy, Jeff's still on that plane!

846
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,440
- We can't leave him there!
- Robbie.

847
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,480
Robbie! The crew will grab him, okay?

848
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,936
- The crew will get him, okay?
- He's in there!

849
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,960
He'll be okay.

850
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,800
I'm okay, Mom. Think. I'm okay.

851
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,320
- Ma!
- Just leave me.

852
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,040
Keep moving forward!

853
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,576
- Follow your instructions.
- The plane's flooding.

854
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,920
- It's alright.
- There's water in the back.

855
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,376
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out!

856
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,960
One after another.
Keep moving forward.

857
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,896
- Keep moving forward.
- This way. I'll help you out.

858
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,320
You go ahead, sweetheart.

859
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,976
- Come this way. Sir.
- Come on. She can't move.

860
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,656
- Sir! Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am? Right there.

861
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,136
- She can't walk.
- Here's a floatation device.

862
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,960
- Take that.
- Be okay.

863
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,400
Everyone, keep moving forward.

864
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,960
Over the wings.

865
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,400
Come on.

866
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,776
- If you've a life vest...
- This way.

867
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,296
- Put it on!
- Alright, slowly. Slowly.

868
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,360
All series near the Intrepid,
plane down.

869
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,880
We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution.

870
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,400
Stay calm and you'll all get out.

871
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,800
Come forward.

872
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,280
Thank you.

873
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,200
Keep pulling.

874
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,440
- Move forward.
- I got him.

875
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,440
Good.

876
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,880
- Come on!
- Come on.

877
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,320
Come on!

878
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,680
Put a blanket on her leg.

879
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,400
She needs a tourniquet.

880
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,520
You're gonna be fine, honey.
Go slowly.

881
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,160
Go slowly. Blanket.

882
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Wrap this around her leg.
Make it tight.

883
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,880
It's so cold out here.

884
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,320
Get those first-aid kits
up to the bow...

885
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,000
and get some extra life jackets
out there.

886
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,200
- We're here.
- Hey!

887
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,080
It's alright. We're here.

888
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,800
- Give me a countdown, Victor.
- Alright.

889
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,720
Three...

890
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,480
two...

891
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,240
We're good.

892
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,440
Come on, buddy.

893
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,040
Hold it right there, baby. Come on.

894
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,960
Easy. Go easy.

895
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,240
Just go easy. Come on.

896
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,440
Come on. One at a time.

897
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,920
We're gonna get everybody, guys.

898
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,600
This is Yogi Berra.
We're thirty seconds out.

899
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,760
With a water temperature
of thirty six degrees...

900
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,440
and a wind chill of minus five...

901
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,320
the surviving passengers
of Flight 1549...

902
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,560
literally have minutes to live.

903
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,200
We're five out.
We've visual on aircraft...

904
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,896
- Alright, give me your hand.
- If anybody's got any problems...

905
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,856
just wait down there.
We got some really good people...

906
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,880
coming on their way, alright?

907
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,320
Stand by. Move front.

908
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,680
Ready.

909
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,320
Fifty yards, go!

910
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,040
- You okay?
- Yes.

911
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,160
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
Alright?

912
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,720
- Okay.
- Got you.

913
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,800
Is anyone still here?

914
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,560
- Come forward.
- Captain!

915
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,200
- Come back! What are you doing...
- Come forward!

916
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,600
We need to get off the plane now.

917
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,360
Captain!

918
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,720
Captain! We've to go!

919
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,480
It's time to get off the plane,
right now!

920
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,760
Alright, you guys go.
Go. I'll be right behind you.

921
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,560
Sully, we gotta go.

922
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,320
- Good? There you go.
- Sorry.

923
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,480
- Thank you.
- Everybody okay?

924
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,240
Everybody's okay. Help is on the way.

925
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,480
Twenty-six passengers going to...

926
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,320
- Port Imperial.
- Nineteen headed to Pier 81.

927
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,560
Yogi Berra, we got passengers onboard
headed to Port Imperial.

928
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,440
Whoever has miraculously survived...

929
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,720
this plummet from the skies
into the icy Hudson...

930
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,840
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

931
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,160
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

932
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,560
In Manhattan, Bobby Cuza,
New York One.

933
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,256
- Come on, sir. Give me your hand.
- Come on.

934
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,040
- Grab on.
- Give me your hand, sir.

935
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,800
It's okay. We got you.

936
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,840
- My hands.
- You gotta warm 'em up.

937
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,640
Get him a blanket, fast.

938
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,880
- I was sure I was gonna die.
- Hey.

939
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,600
Hey, no one dies today.

940
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,560
Give me your hand.

941
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,040
Here you go, Captain. This way.

942
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,400
- Give us your hand, sir. Your hand.
- Sully, wrap it around your arms.

943
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,560
- Come on. Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

944
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
Can we get a couple more
blankets over here?

945
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

946
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,480
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

947
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,960
- Give him some room.
- You're welcome.

948
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,840
Yeah, we got 'em all.

949
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
- Hello?
- I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

950
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,720
Good. Are you still on the 5.50 home?

951
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,480
There's been an incident.

952
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,280
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

953
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,800
Turn on the television.

954
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,120
What do you mean
"Turn on the television"?

955
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,600
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

956
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,760
I'll call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

957
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,320
I had to land in the Hudson.

958
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,320
Sully, I don't understand.

959
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,640
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I'm okay.

960
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,600
But I've to go.

961
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,160
Girls, turn on the TV.

962
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,280
An extensive rescue effort
is underway...

963
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,640
after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River...

964
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,336
- sending passengers scrambling...
- Oh, my God.

965
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,880
For safety in...

966
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,560
Jefferson, we counted fifty-six.
Inbound, Pier Eighty-one.

967
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,280
West Coast Guard,
metro traffic service New York.

968
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,320
Be advised, the Hudson River
is closed to all traffic.

969
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,616
Attention passengers,
please be seated and...

970
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,536
- keep the aisles clear.
- If you've any wet clothing on...

971
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,880
take it off and wrap up
in a blanket from the Red Cross.

972
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,680
Move in. Together.

973
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,160
You're gonna be okay. Okay, Lucille?

974
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,440
Alright. I'm gonna take you
right to the ambulance, alright?

975
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,880
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

976
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,320
There's lots of boats!

977
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,880
Jeff!

978
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,160
- Sully!
- Dan!

979
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,640
Dan, I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

980
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,800
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

981
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,160
Okay. How are you?

982
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,760
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

983
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,080
- Alright.
- Okay.

984
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,520
Honey, it's me.

985
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,240
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

986
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,600
Sherri, I cannot believe
I am talking to you.

987
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,240
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg...

988
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,840
and Police Commissioner
Raymond Kelly.

989
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,776
The Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

990
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,256
- We're still working.
- Sully, I can...

991
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,040
keep assembling the count.

992
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,600
Jeff, I need a count.

993
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,016
- We've gotta have a count.
- There's no way...

994
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,480
to get a real count out here, Sully.

995
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,840
Sully, Jeff's right.
Let's get you in some dry clothes...

996
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,376
- before you freeze to death.
- Captain, what if the Mayor...

997
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,720
and Chief Kelly come down here...

998
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,216
- to meet with you?
- Dan, because it was...

999
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,280
- a domestic flight...
- Yeah, we got no manifest.

1000
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,680
We're gonna have to track
the passenger information down...

1001
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,320
- one by one.
- Can you help?

1002
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,776
Yeah. I'm gonna call John Carey.
We're gonna get you a count.

1003
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,176
But, Sully, listen.
You've done enough.

1004
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,680
Let me take it from here.

1005
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,920
Bring it, bring it down...

1006
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,640
- Jeff?
- Pop!

1007
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,600
I'm okay. I was on the other wing.

1008
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,040
They brought us to Jersey.

1009
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,920
I couldn't see you.

1010
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,240
- I couldn't find you.
- I know.

1011
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,880
I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.

1012
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,480
I shouted back. I guess the river...

1013
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,080
- Are you okay?
- I love you, son.

1014
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
I love you, too.

1015
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,520
Can you believe we made it?

1016
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,040
I mean, the plane...

1017
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,600
the plane crashed...

1018
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,240
on the river!

1019
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,320
Are you kidding me?

1020
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,920
So unbelievable.

1021
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,360
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1022
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Hey, Patty.
Supe sent me looking for you.

1023
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,320
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1024
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,640
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1025
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,680
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1026
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,440
I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch!

1027
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,640
- What?
- Everyone's been pulled off.

1028
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,520
- It's a miracle!
- I thought I lost them all.

1029
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,680
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1030
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,560
What is my pulse rate?

1031
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,560
It's 110.

1032
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,200
My normal resting is 55.

1033
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,840
110...

1034
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,520
that's not good.

1035
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,040
You're right. 110 is not good.

1036
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,400
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1037
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,440
How is Doreen?

1038
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,816
Fairly severe laceration.
But we'll keep her a day or two...

1039
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,640
- to stem the infection.
- But she'll be okay?

1040
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,280
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1041
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,976
Although no one'll believe her.
Hell, I'm standing here...

1042
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,376
with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1043
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,760
You landed a plane on the Hudson.

1044
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,800
- Not a scratch on you.
- Arnie.

1045
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,280
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today?

1046
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,960
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

1047
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,800
Got a count.

1048
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,240
155.

1049
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,640
155.

1050
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,040
It's official.

1051
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,360
- 155.
- 155.

1052
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,680
155.

1053
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,360
Thank you, Arnie.

1054
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,000
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1055
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,360
- Sully.
- Carl.

1056
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,016
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1057
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,400
Well, we're here.

1058
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,360
It's about all I know at the moment.

1059
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,800
- This is Ms May, with the hotel.
- Wanted to have...

1060
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,976
- a quick word with you.
- I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1061
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,856
This is only to say that
my staff and I are committed...

1062
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,936
to protecting your privacy.
So, if there's anything...

1063
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,160
- I can do at all...
- If it's possible...

1064
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,600
I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1065
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,000
- It's the only clothing that I have.
- Dry-cleaning?

1066
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,400
If it's too much.

1067
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,856
- If it's too late?
- Are you kidding?

1068
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,400
Captain Sullenberger, I'd give you
this whole hotel if I could.

1069
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,680
Okay. Well, thank you, Evelyn.

1070
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,640
- Thank you very much.
- Anything for Sully.

1071
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,280
- Okay.
- So, have a blessed day.

1072
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,600
What just happened?

1073
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,120
You just got hugged
by a total stranger.

1074
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,800
Come on, Sully.

1075
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,640
When's the last time
you heard of someone...

1076
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,200
landing a jet plane on the water...

1077
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,080
and everybody lived?

1078
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,320
Exactly.

1079
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,440
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1080
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,920
And new clothes.

1081
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,440
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1082
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,160
Kmart was the only store open.

1083
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,696
It's Queens.
It's ten o'clock in the evening.

1084
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,000
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- Yeah.

1085
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,560
Sully.

1086
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,600
What are you even still doing
in uniform?

1087
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,480
You know, I don't know.

1088
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,360
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1089
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,600
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1090
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,440
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

1091
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,760
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1092
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,520
Especially with an airplane in it.

1093
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,080
I'll see you later, Sully.

1094
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,560
The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing".

1095
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,720
The perfect timing
of the NYPD scuba units...

1096
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
and of the ferry boat captains...

1097
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,080
and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.

1098
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,480
Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time...

1099
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,800
became a man for all time.

1100
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,560
- This is Kristine Johnson...
- The timing.

1101
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,560
Reporting live from the Hudson River.

1102
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,056
New York One Minute.
The coast guard...

1103
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,000
released this new video
of Flight 1549...

1104
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,000
making its emergency landing
on the Hudson.

1105
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,696
Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine...

1106
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,600
of the aircraft river
lift the plane...

1107
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,936
out of the water Battery Park City
later this morning.

1108
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,320
- Mayor Bloomberg...
- Hey, Sully. Let me...

1109
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,240
Come on. Answer.

1110
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,520
Answer!

1111
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,920
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1112
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,440
- Sully?
- I know that Airbus...

1113
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,320
has simulations scheduled
for the S22 sim at the factory.

1114
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,240
But that's next week in Toulouse.

1115
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,480
- Can you get them to reschedule?
- It's 1.30 in the morning.

1116
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,000
I need you to make it happen
before we listen to the CVR.

1117
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,080
Before our testimony is complete.

1118
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,440
Why?

1119
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,600
I've a right to see the simulations
and I've a feeling that...

1120
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,240
with human pilots
and not a computer...

1121
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,120
the results
are going to be different.

1122
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,960
What if they show
the exact same result?

1123
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,920
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

1124
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,136
It's all about the timing, Larry.
You can accomplish anything...

1125
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,560
if you're never in a hurry.

1126
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,400
I sure as hell agree with that.

1127
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,960
The CVR is on Wednesday.
That's thirty six hours.

1128
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,960
- Can you make it happen?
- I'll try.

1129
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,560
It's a lot of phone calls to make.

1130
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,640
It's already 7.30
in the morning in France...

1131
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,640
so you better get started.
Thank you, Larry. Thank you.

1132
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,840
- Hey, Lorrie.
- Hi.

1133
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,720
I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing.

1134
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,480
Sweetheart, what happened?

1135
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,560
I realized just now...

1136
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,560
for the first time,
that there were...

1137
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,840
There were 155 people on that plane
and you're one of them.

1138
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
We almost lost you.

1139
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,480
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

1140
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,480
How are you holding up?

1141
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,400
I'm holding up.

1142
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,680
Please tell me this is almost over.

1143
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,400
- It's almost over.
- Okay.

1144
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,000
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1145
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,200
I'll call you
when they're done with me.

1146
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,480
- Sully.
- Let's go, Larry.

1147
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,040
- Morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

1148
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,280
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

1149
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,216
My name is Charles Porter.
I've been assigned...

1150
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,936
by the National Transportation
Safety Board...

1151
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,560
to conduct this public hearing
here today.

1152
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,880
We've a lot of material to cover.

1153
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,560
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1154
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,416
and we we'll be listening to it
for the first time...

1155
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,080
along with you, gentlemen.

1156
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,440
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union...

1157
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,720
Airbus has agreed
to link us via satellite...

1158
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,600
- to today's piloted simulations.
- Upload link, please.

1159
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,120
They're just simulations, Sully.

1160
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,560
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1161
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,840
Might change theirs.

1162
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,240
Birds.

1163
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,040
Number one's rolling back.

1164
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,040
- And number two. Pilot off.
- Auto pilot's off.

1165
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,976
- Flight Director's off.
- Flight Director is off.

1166
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,200
Alright. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1167
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,800
- We've to return to the field.
- Okay.

1168
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,080
I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1-3.

1169
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,400
I'll activate the approach for you.

1170
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,480
It's activated.

1171
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,360
Runway 1-3.

1172
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Glide slopes coming in nicely.

1173
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,520
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1174
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,480
Sink Rate 900.

1175
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,120
Too low, flaps.

1176
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,760
Flight slow.

1177
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,200
Too low, flaps.

1178
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,000
- Forty, thirty, twenty.
- Too low, flaps.

1179
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,400
Successful landing at LaGuardia,
runway 1-3.

1180
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,840
For the record, the pilots
and the computer Sims...

1181
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,720
bear the same result.

1182
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,560
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1183
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,240
Upload the second run.

1184
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,680
Birds.

1185
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,640
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1186
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,520
Heading 3-1-0.

1187
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,760
I'm gonna give you
direct to Teterboro.

1188
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,520
Direct Teterboro.

1189
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,840
One thousand.

1190
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,480
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1191
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,360
Too low, terrain.

1192
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,200
Too low, terrain.

1193
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,080
Too low, terrain.

1194
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,960
Fifty, forty, thirty, twenty.

1195
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,080
Successful landing at Teterboro,
runway 1-9.

1196
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,760
Multiple airports, runways...

1197
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,160
two successful landings.

1198
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,720
We're simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1199
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,960
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1200
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,080
And frankly, I really don't know...

1201
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,280
what you gentlemen
plan to gain by it.

1202
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,520
Can we get serious now?

1203
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,160
- Captain?
- We've all heard about...

1204
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,640
the computer simulations and now
we're watching actual Sims.

1205
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,280
But I can't quite believe...

1206
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,960
you still have not
taken into account the human factor.

1207
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,400
Human piloted simulations...

1208
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,640
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1209
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,320
No, they don't.

1210
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,240
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings...

1211
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,000
like people
who are experiencing this...

1212
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,416
- for the first time.
- Well, they may not be...

1213
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,896
- reacting like you did.
- Immediately...

1214
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,520
after the bird strike
they're turning back for the airport.

1215
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,280
Just as in the computer Sims...

1216
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,880
- correct?
- That is correct.

1217
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,400
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1218
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,760
They did not run a check.

1219
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,536
- They did not switch on the APU.
- They had all the same parameters...

1220
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,480
- that you faced.
- No one warned us.

1221
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,720
No one said,
"You're going to lose both engines...

1222
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,120
at a lower altitude
than any jet in history."

1223
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
But be cool. Just...

1224
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,920
make a left turn for LaGuardia...

1225
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,600
like you're going back
to pick up the milk.

1226
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,640
This was dual engine loss
at 2,800 feet...

1227
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,880
followed by an immediate
water landing...

1228
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,560
with 155 souls onboard.

1229
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,280
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

1230
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,840
No one.

1231
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,840
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle...

1232
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,280
we're not the Thunderbirds up there.

1233
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,320
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver...

1234
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,680
before he actually pulled it off.

1235
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,680
I'm not questioning the pilots.
They're good pilots.

1236
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,600
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport...

1237
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,360
immediately after the bird strike.

1238
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,440
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1239
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,880
In these simulations,
you've taken all of the humanity...

1240
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,440
out of the cockpit.

1241
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,280
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

1242
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,320
For these simulations?

1243
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,800
You're looking for human error.

1244
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,480
Then make it human.

1245
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,200
This wasn't a video game.

1246
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,200
It was life and death.

1247
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,680
Sully's right.
That's worth a few seconds.

1248
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,120
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1249
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,080
- Okay, ask...
- Seventeen.

1250
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,920
Seventeen?

1251
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,600
The pilot who landed at Teterboro...

1252
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,480
had seventeen practice attempts...

1253
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,200
before the simulation
we just witnessed.

1254
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,000
Your reaction decision time
will be set at thirty five seconds.

1255
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,360
Thirty-five seconds.
That's not enough time.

1256
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,920
We only had 208 seconds total, so...

1257
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,560
I'll take it.

1258
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,280
Upload the link. Return to LaGuardia.

1259
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,640
Now with an added thirty five-second
delay in response time.

1260
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,840
- Birds.
- Okay, I saw them.

1261
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,160
- Give me thirty five seconds.
- Thirty five seconds.

1262
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,600
- Time's up.
- Here we go.

1263
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,400
Flight path vector.

1264
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,640
- Going for 1-3.
- Okay.

1265
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,680
- Activate confirm.
- Alright. You're confirmed.

1266
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,320
We're heading right for the airport.

1267
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,360
Caution, obstacle.

1268
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,080
Caution, obstacle.

1269
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,000
We're about
seven miles from the runway.

1270
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,400
Caution, obstacle.

1271
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,240
Terrain.

1272
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,480
Pull up.

1273
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,080
Pull up.

1274
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,280
Pull up.

1275
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,760
Pull up.

1276
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,680
Too low, terrain.

1277
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,536
- Too low, terrain.
- We got a little extra speed.

1278
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,440
- Too low, terrain.
- You want some flaps?

1279
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,240
- Too low, terrain.
- No, leave the flaps up.

1280
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,520
Too low, terrain.

1281
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,200
Too low, terrain.

1282
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,080
Too low, terrain.

1283
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,040
Fifty, forty, thirty, twenty.

1284
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,440
Let's try Teterboro.

1285
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,840
Upload the link, please.

1286
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,960
- Birds.
- Auto pilot off.

1287
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,680
Flight Director off. Hack the time.

1288
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,640
- Thirty-five seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1289
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,200
Engine one and two fail.

1290
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,640
- Turn.
- Okay.

1291
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,680
Let's see if we can make it.

1292
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,960
- Heading sub 2-9-8.
- You seeing Teterboro out there?

1293
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,440
I do.

1294
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,960
Way too low.

1295
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,480
Obstacle.

1296
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,720
Pull up.

1297
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,880
Pull up.

1298
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,880
Pull up.

1299
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,040
Pull up.

1300
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,320
Pull up.

1301
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,160
- Pull up.
- Not gonna work.

1302
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,680
Pull up.

1303
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,920
Pull up.

1304
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,160
Pull up.

1305
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,320
Does anyone
need to see more simulations?

1306
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,560
Now that we've seen
what could have happened...

1307
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,320
can we listen to what actually did?

1308
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,840
We'll look at all
the results at a later date.

1309
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,320
- Elizabeth.
- For the record...

1310
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,160
this is the CVR
of US Airways Flight 1549...

1311
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,520
January 15th, 2009.

1312
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,200
Gentlemen, headsets.

1313
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,280
Birds!

1314
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,400
Shit.

1315
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,400
Yeah.

1316
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,200
We got one rolling back.

1317
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,960
We've both of them rolling back.

1318
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,880
Ignition start.

1319
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,200
I'm starting the APU.

1320
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,200
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1321
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,800
- Get out the QRH.
- Priority left.

1322
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,600
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1323
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,760
Mayday. Mayday. This is Cactus 1549.

1324
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,760
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1325
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,400
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

1326
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,080
Okay, you need to
return to LaGuardia?

1327
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,080
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1328
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,840
- Which engine did you lose?
- Both. Both engines.

1329
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,560
"If fuel remaining, engine mode,
select your ignition."

1330
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,960
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1331
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,320
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1332
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,960
Airspeed. Optimum relight,
three hundred knots.

1333
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,600
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1334
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,600
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you...

1335
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,840
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

1336
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,760
We're unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1337
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,400
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1338
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,720
Online.

1339
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,640
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1340
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,600
Distress message transmit.
We did that.

1341
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,520
Cactus 1549,
it's gonna be left traffic...

1342
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,200
runway 3-1.

1343
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,560
- Unable.
- Okay. What do you need to land?

1344
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,920
- Wind shear.
- FAC 1 off, then on.

1345
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,760
Been ten seconds, Captain. Come on.

1346
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,160
Talk to me.

1347
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,160
Cactus 1549, runway 4's available
if you wanna make left traffic...

1348
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,520
- to runway 4.
- I don't think...

1349
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,080
we can make any runway.

1350
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,936
What about over to our right?
Anything in New Jersey?

1351
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,200
Maybe Teterboro?

1352
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,880
Okay, yeah. Off your right side
is Teterboro airport.

1353
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,520
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1354
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,160
This is Teterboro tower. Go ahead.

1355
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,840
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.
Needs to go...

1356
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,056
- to the airport right now.
- Check. Does he need assistance?

1357
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,440
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1358
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,680
Cactus 1549, you wanna try
and go to Teterboro?

1359
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,120
Obstacle.

1360
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,240
Obstacle.

1361
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,400
Pull up.

1362
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,840
- Clear of conflict.
- "No relight after 30 seconds...

1363
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,336
engine master one and two,
confirm off."

1364
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,640
Off.

1365
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,600
"Wait thirty seconds."

1366
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,480
Too low, terrain.

1367
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,320
Too low, terrain.

1368
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,320
Too low, terrain.

1369
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,280
Too low, terrain.

1370
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,840
This is the captain.

1371
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,840
Brace for impact.

1372
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,280
Five hundred.

1373
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,680
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

1374
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,376
- You can land runway one Teterboro.
- Head down.

1375
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,640
- We can't make it.
- Stay down.

1376
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,256
Okay. Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?

1377
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,040
- Brace.
- Go ahead. Try number one.

1378
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,720
- Number one.
- Heads down.

1379
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,240
- No relight.
- Stay down.

1380
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,376
- We're gonna end up in the Hudson.
- Brace.

1381
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,136
- Too low, terrain.
- I'm sorry. Say again...

1382
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,120
- Cactus?
- Too low, terrain.

1383
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,960
Too low, terrain.

1384
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,400
Alright, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1385
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,800
- Flaps out.
- Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

1386
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,800
You also got Newark
off your two o'clock...

1387
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,640
- in about seven miles.
- Got flaps out.

1388
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,880
- Two hundred fifty feet in the air.
- Pull up.

1389
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,640
A hundred seventy knots.
Got no power...

1390
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,376
- on either one. Try the other one.
- Try the other one.

1391
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,080
- 1549? Still up?
- Caution, terrain.

1392
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,120
- Caution, terrain.
- One hundred and fifty knots.

1393
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,600
Got flaps two. You want more?

1394
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,176
- No. Let's stay at two.
- You got runway 2-9...

1395
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,496
available at Newark.
It'll be two o'clock...

1396
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,120
- in seven miles.
- You got any ideas?

1397
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,480
Caution, terrain.

1398
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,560
- Actually not.
- Terrain.

1399
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,840
Pull up.

1400
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,440
Pull up.

1401
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,320
Pull up.

1402
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,240
Pull up.

1403
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,040
Pull up.

1404
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,000
Pull up.

1405
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,600
- Pull up.
- We're gonna brace.

1406
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,880
- Pull up.
- Thirty.

1407
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,360
- Pull up.
- Twenty.

1408
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,800
Pull up.

1409
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,200
I need to take a quick break.

1410
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,960
What did you think?

1411
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,080
Hearing the CVR just now?

1412
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,520
Let me tell you what I think.

1413
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
I'm just so damn proud.

1414
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,640
And you, you're right there,
through all that distraction.

1415
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,560
With so much at stake.

1416
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,520
We did this together. We're a team.

1417
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,680
Thanks, Sully.

1418
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,120
- We did our job.
- We did our job.

1419
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,320
Hey, you did good.

1420
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,376
Alright, folks.
I'd like to call this hearing...

1421
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,680
back to order.
If we could settle, please.

1422
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,240
Take your seats.

1423
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,280
That is honestly the first time...

1424
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,200
that I've listened to
a crash recording...

1425
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,880
while actually sitting...

1426
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,360
with the captain
and the first officer.

1427
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,720
It's extraordinary.

1428
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,640
That was no simulation.

1429
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,960
No, it wasn't.

1430
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,840
Gentlemen...

1431
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,680
I want to inform you that...

1432
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,360
the left engine has been recovered.

1433
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,760
We just received
a comprehensive report.

1434
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,800
There was extensive damage...

1435
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,880
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

1436
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,520
Five compressor blades
were fractured...

1437
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,640
and eight variable guide vanes
missing.

1438
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,040
So, no thrust?

1439
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,720
As you testified...

1440
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,000
it was completely destroyed.

1441
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,200
The ACARS data was wrong.

1442
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,880
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1443
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,680
I can say
with absolute confidence that...

1444
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,720
after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew...

1445
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,360
with bird experts,
aviation engineers...

1446
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,000
after running through
every scenario...

1447
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,680
after interviewing each player...

1448
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,240
there is still an "X"
in this result...

1449
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,520
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1450
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,560
Remove you from the equation,
and the math...

1451
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,440
just fails.

1452
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,720
I disagree.

1453
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,080
It wasn't just me.
It was all of us.

1454
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,800
It was Jeff and
Donna and Sheila...

1455
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,400
and Doreen and...

1456
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,360
all of the passengers...

1457
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,040
the rescue workers...

1458
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,920
air traffic control and...

1459
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,960
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1460
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,520
We all did it.

1461
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,960
We survived.

1462
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,400
First Officer Skiles,
is there anything you'd like to add?

1463
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,880
Anything...

1464
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,920
you would've done differently
if you...

1465
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,040
had to do it again?

1466
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,240
Yes.

1467
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,360
I would've done it in July.

1468
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,640
- 7F.
- 11F.

1469
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,800
- 9D.
- 1C.

1470
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,040
- 25B.
- 26B.

1471
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,080
- 10B.
- 9A.

1472
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,280
- 13C.
- 21A and B.

1473
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,480
155 is a number...

1474
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,120
but when you can put faces to it...

1475
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,240
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces...

1476
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,160
the wives, the daughters, the sons...

1477
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,520
the fathers, the mothers,
the brothers...

1478
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,000
it gets to be a pretty big number
pretty quickly.

1479
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,480
This is your captain speaking.

1480
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,160
I think today was
as much and as good...

1481
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,240
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1482
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:51,200
And because of the events
of January 15th, 2009...

1483
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,320
I'm convinced that we'll be joined...

1484
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,000
in our hearts and
in our minds forever.

1485
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,800
I'm the keeper of the mail and...

1486
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,120
so I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1487
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,960
And I open the letters that
come to our house from your families.

1488
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,640
And I open the Christmas cards.

1489
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,640
So, thank you so much
for the gratitude...

1490
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,440
that you've expressed
to our families...

1491
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,840
and the letters and the cards...

1492
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:12,480
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1493
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,800
So, thank you.
