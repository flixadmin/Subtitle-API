1
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,875
[Elodie]
There are many stories of chivalry

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,291
where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.

3
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,958
This is not one of them.

4
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,416
[horses chuffing]

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,333
[tense music playing]

6
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,458
[wings flapping]

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,041
[King] There it is.

8
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,291
Form up!

9
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
Let's kill the beast.

10
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,875
For glory! Hyah!

11
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,333
Be on guard.

12
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,916
[soft cracking]

13
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,958
[dragon snarls]

14
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,041
[swords clanging]

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,375
[dragon roaring]

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,250
Form the line!

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,541
[soldiers breathing shakily]

18
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,500
[dragon snarls, shrieks]

19
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,583
[soldiers screaming]

20
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,791
Hold!

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,333
[wings flapping]

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,291
[soldiers screaming]

23
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,916
[dragon snarls]

24
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,500
[panting]

25
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,791
[grunts]

26
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[Floria] The last I could find.

27
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,916
[Elodie] Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,333
[Floria] This morning.

29
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,541
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

30
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Not the drapes!

31
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,916
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,625
They serve a purpose.

33
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
Floria, our people are freezing.

34
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,541
And starving.

35
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
[carriage driver shouting indistinctly]

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
Who'd come this far north?

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
[Floria] Elodie, why are they leaving?

38
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
[Elodie] There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

39
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,875
[man 1] I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

40
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
[woman 1] For food, join the line!

41
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,541
-[man 2] Keep to one side.
-[man 3] I'm starving.

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
All right then.

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,708
[man 4] Get off! It's mine!

44
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,833
-Hey! Give me back my food.
-Get off of me, old man!

45
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
You've had enough!

46
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
[woman 2] Share this
with your sister. Go on.

47
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
-Could you see who it was?
-[guard] A stranger, my lady.

48
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,083
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

49
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,625
-I'll see to it.
-Come on, Flor.

50
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
-[woman 2] Move on.
-[woman 3] Yes.

51
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
-[man 5] Get in line.
-Give it to me.

52
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,666
-[woman] I want to meet her first.
-Father?

53
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
You must be Elodie.

54
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,833
I am.

55
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,833
She will do.

56
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,291
[Lord Bayford sighs softly]

57
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,541
-[Red Priestess] We await your decision.
-Thank you, Your Holiness.

58
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,333
Please, this way.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Father, what's happening?

60
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
Who is that?

61
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,083
[reading indistinctly]

62
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Stepmother?

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, what is it?

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,291
[Lord Bayford] From the Queen of Aurea.

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,166
[chuckles softly]

66
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
A proposal.

67
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,250
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Lord Bayford] Huhâ€¦

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
-I have made a match.
-May I?

69
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,791
[Lord Bayford] Uh-huh.

70
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,041
He is a prince.

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
A prince?

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,875
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

73
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,125
Go. See the world.

74
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,291
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

75
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
That's no reason to marry.

76
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
We need this.

77
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,916
Our stores are empty.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,041
We will not make it to the thaw.

79
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,583
Your people need you.

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey.

81
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,208
This is who we are.

82
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
[sailor 1] Get to the port side.

83
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,791
[sailor 2] Port side.

84
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,083
[indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
Elodie, what's the matter?

86
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,541
Nothing.

87
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Father says it's natural to be nervous

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

89
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
They're strangers.

90
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

91
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
[sailor 1] Mind the lines.

92
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,666
Oh!

93
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,333
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

94
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,041
Come down here.

95
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,166
Come on.

96
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

97
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,958
Scared, cold as a corpse.

98
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
Nose all drippy and wet.

99
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,666
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

100
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,583
-[both] First impressions are everything.
-Hmm.

101
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,000
[sailor 2] Come on, lift up.

102
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,541
-[exhales sharply]
-[sailor blowing horn]

103
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,125
[sailor 3] Look at that.

104
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,750
I have good news, girls.

105
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

106
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,083
It should be any time now.

107
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,333
[Lord and Lady Bayford chuckle]

108
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,291
Father.

109
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,875
What in the world?

110
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,291
Looks almostâ€¦ almost like a--

111
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,458
A dragon.

112
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,208
[horn bellowing]

113
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,250
[horn bellowing continues]

114
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,291
-It's okay.
-[Lady Bayford chuckles]

115
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,375
[ethereal music playing]

116
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
[breathes deeply]

117
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
Oh, my heavens. [chuckles]

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,250
[gasps]

119
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
It's magnificent.

120
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,500
My lords, my ladies,

121
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

122
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,958
The royal family is at prayer,

123
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
but word has been sent of your arrival.

124
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

125
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
If you will follow me.

126
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,333
[Floria] Is this a dream?

127
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,291
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

128
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,833
[Lady Bayford shushes]

129
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
If you want these people
to think we belong here,

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,166
you can't act so easily impressed.

131
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

132
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,083
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

133
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,625
[birds chirping]

134
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,458
[chamberlain]
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

135
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,125
A bath has been drawn

136
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
and supper has been carried hence.

137
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

138
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,666
to meet His Royal Highness.

139
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,166
[chuckles softly]

141
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
[Lady Bayford] Floria,
stop touching everything.

142
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,791
Is something wrong?

143
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,250
-I just hope he's kind.
-Hmm.

144
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,500
-And well-read.
-Yeah.

145
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Handsome.

146
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,333
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

147
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,708
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

148
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, indeed.

149
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Come.

150
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,625
[birds chirping]

151
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,375
[maid] M'lady.

152
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Everyone's waiting.

153
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,583
[wind whistling outside]

154
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,166
[sighs]

155
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Ellie?

156
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,625
I can't sleep.

157
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,375
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

158
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,416
You and me both.

159
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

160
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,583
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

161
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,166
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

162
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,333
She means well, even if she is a bitâ€¦

163
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
-Exhausting?
-[chuckles]

164
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,333
It'll be fine. You'll see.

165
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

166
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
[Queen Isabelle]
What is your greatest strength?

167
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
[Elodie] I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.

168
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
[Queen Isabelle]
Some might call that a weakness.

169
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
Do you know your heart?

170
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
[Elodie] I believe I do, Your Majesty.

171
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,041
[Queen Isabelle]
And what is it telling you now?

172
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,125
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

173
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,625
[Queen Isabelle] Arise, Elodie.

174
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm Henry.

175
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

176
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,291
We all are.

177
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
My son understates our joy.

178
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
And if I may say so,

179
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,291
your father has understated your beauty.

180
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,500
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
[chuckles] I see she arrives
with some wit.

182
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,083
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

183
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
And you must be Floria.

184
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,666
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

185
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,583
I love your castle.

186
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,041
I mean, I really love it.

187
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Like, a lotâ€¦

188
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,875
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,458
You are to make yourself at home, child.

190
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:35,208
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

191
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
[Lord Bayford] Yesâ€¦

192
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

193
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,416
you wish to discuss in person.

194
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,333
-The two of us can confer in private.
-Yes.

195
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,625
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

196
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
They have a far more
important task at hand.

197
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
They must get to know each other.

198
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
[Henry] Do you have any questions of me?

199
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
[Elodie] Questions of what subject?

200
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,458
You may choose the subject.

201
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
What do you think about me?

202
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,208
Pardon?

203
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,625
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

204
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,416
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

205
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
truly likes me or not.

206
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,500
[scoffs lightly]

207
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,541
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

208
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,750
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

209
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,916
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Harsh and barren.

211
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
This union will save us.

212
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
I've made my peace with it.

213
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,000
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

214
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Is something wrong?

215
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,375
It's justâ€¦

216
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,750
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

217
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,541
[chuckles] Different. In what way?

218
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,625
Far more, umâ€¦

219
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,791
flowery.

220
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,500
[both laugh]

221
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,458
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

222
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,958
and my sister's idea was the heartâ€¦

223
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,458
-The heart.
-Mmm.

224
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,041
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

225
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,708
You actually drew this?

226
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,041
[chuckles]

227
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,083
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

228
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

229
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,625
That is very clever.

230
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

231
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
-May I ask you another question?
-Certainly.

232
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
Do they always follow you so closely?

233
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
This is them giving me space.

234
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,875
That must be tiring.

235
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,458
It is, actually.

236
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,541
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

237
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,333
Do you ride?

238
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,958
-[horses whinny]
-[riveting music playing]

239
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,583
[Elodie] Hyah!

240
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,416
-Where did you learn to ride like that?
-My mother.

241
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Which way now?

242
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,291
Well, depends on what you want to see.

243
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everything.

244
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Very well.

245
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[doors open]

246
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened in there?

247
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,833
Speak already.

248
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
-Is the wedding still on?
-Aye.

249
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,583
You settled on a fair bride price?

250
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,125
More gold than I could ever imagine.

251
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
[Lady Bayford gasps softly]

252
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
Then why do you look so?

253
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

254
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

255
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,041
No, I did not.

256
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

257
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

258
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

259
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,333
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

260
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Torches.

261
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,166
You saw that?

262
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
I couldn't sleep.

263
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,125
It was an ancient ceremony.

264
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
Or rather, one of three.

265
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,541
They're very significant to my family.

266
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, umâ€¦

267
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
They honor our ancestors.

268
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

269
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
[Elodie] It is quite beautiful.

270
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,833
[Henry] Yes, I suppose.

271
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,416
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

272
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,125
May I confide in you something?

273
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,041
Yes.

274
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,791
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

275
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,583
Really set out and see it, you know?

276
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,375
I do, actually.

277
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
It's my life's dream.

278
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,708
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

279
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,208
The ones you only read about.

280
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,500
[Elodie chuckles softly]

281
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,166
Perhaps, one day, we will.

282
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
Perhaps.

283
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
[bell tolling]

284
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[woman] And the orange in this area.

285
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,000
[Lady Bayford]
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

286
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,666
Well, I'm glad you approve.

287
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
Very elegant.

288
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,750
You have impeccable taste.

289
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Everything is just so exquisite.

290
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

291
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,750
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

292
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,708
seeing as we're about to be family.

293
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,333
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

294
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,416
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

295
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,208
The finest in the city.

296
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,958
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

297
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

298
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,875
Nor place undue import

299
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,708
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

300
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,000
Uhâ€¦ "Necessity"?

301
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,208
Well, your family needs money.

302
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,458
My family needs a bride.

303
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,791
What we don't need is more family.

304
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,583
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

305
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,000
-I merely--
-Elodie.

306
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Pardon?

307
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,416
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

308
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I said.

309
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,291
Good day, Lady Bayford.

310
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,250
It's perfect.

311
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,833
Everything in here is so perfect.

312
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,125
[Elodie] Stepmother.

313
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,250
Is something the matter?

314
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,666
Elodie,

315
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,041
I know we haven't always been close,

316
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,791
but I need you to listen to me now.

317
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
This weddingâ€¦ is a mistake.

318
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,708
[scoffs] What?

319
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't understand.

320
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
These people, I don't trust them.

321
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,041
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

322
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,250
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

323
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,291
Floria.

324
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,458
I was wrong.

325
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,750
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

326
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,000
[Elodie] Wellâ€¦

327
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,208
-What does Father think?
-He refuses to talk about it.

328
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,458
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

329
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,250
-Because you're being unreasonable.
-That's enough, Flor.

330
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:10,000
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

331
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,000
Am I interrupting something?

332
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,750
No.

333
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,500

335
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:30,416
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

336
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,125
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

337
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,541
Time for what?

338
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,041
[Lady Bayford] I hope you know
what you're doing.

339
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,916
Good night, my angels.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,708
-Good night, Father.
-Good night, Father.

341
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,833
Good night.

342

[Floria] Wow.

[serene music playing]

350
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,583
[priest] You may kiss the bride.

351
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,458
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

352
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:36,125
[guests applaud, cheer]

353
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,166
Goodbye, Father.

354
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,833
[softly] I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

355
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,250
Twice as beautiful.

356
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,291
-I love you.
-I love you.

357
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey! Hey, hey!

358
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,125
[Elodie] Where are we going?

359
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,416
[Henry] Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

360
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,333
[Elodie] Yes.

361
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,333
[Henry] We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

362
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,583
[wind whistles]

363
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,666
Welcome, Princess.

364
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,083
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

365
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,500
to protect our people.

366
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,083
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

367
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,458
So, tonight,

368
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:22,041
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

369
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

370
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,208
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

371
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,458
A creature dwelt here first.

372
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,083
The last of its kind.

373
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,208
With savage bloodlust,

374
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,750
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

375
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,166
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

376
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,375
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

377
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,791
and each man met his end.

378
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,041
Each save one.

379
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,500
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

380
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,166
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

381
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,625
A cruel torture.

382
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,791
He adored his daughters,

383
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,041
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

384
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,500
And so, a pact was made.

385
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,958
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

386
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,625
and a kingdom was born.

387
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,916
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

388
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,416
A tradition going back centuries.

389
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,083
Your hand, child.

390
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:07,708
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

391
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,458
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

392
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,375
She is now of royal blood.

393
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,791
[inhales sharply, exhales]

394
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,583
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

395
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,791
pay your due to the realm.

396
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,208
[softly] Toss the coin into the chasm.

397
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,041
The ceremony is now complete.

398
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,916
You may make your return.

399
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,583
I'm supposed to carry you back.

400
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm fine with walking, really.

401
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,875
Floria would love this part.

402
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,916
Close your eyes.

403
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,125
I've got you.

[Henry breathing shakily]

405

You know nothing of our story.

847
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,000
Take your family

848
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,166
and run.

849
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,541
[man] Come. Let's go.

850
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:21,833
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

851
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,166
No?

852
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,750
You insolent creature.

853
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,541
You think we ought to fear you now?

854
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:39,791
Why?

855
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:43,750
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

856
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,708
It's not me you should fear.

857
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,291
This is the end of your story.

858
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
[woman] Run!

859
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,416
-[woman] It's the dragon!
-[man] Run!

860
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:16,125
[roars]

861
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:42,833
No!

862
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,125
[sailor 1] Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

863
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,875
[sailor 2] Let's be sharp there, lads.

864
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,125
[Lady Bayford] You can't be serious.

865
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,083
[Elodie] But I am.

866
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,916
We'll run it together.

867
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,583
We've got a bounty of supplies.

868
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,041
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

869
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,166
Oh, Elodie.

870
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,458
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

871
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,500
Can I help too?

872
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,625
Floria.

873
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:02,791
I'm counting on it.

874
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,541
[Floria] Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

875
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,208
[Lady Bayford] Oh, wide heavens!

876
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:19,458
[sailor] My lady,
what course shall we steer?

877
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Home.

878
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:35,125
[roaring]

879
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:28,166
â™ª Love is a burning thing â™ª

880
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:35,583
â™ª It makes a fiery ring â™ª

881
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:42,625
â™ª Bound by wild desire â™ª

882
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:48,625
â™ª I fell into a ring of fire â™ª

883
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:57,458
â™ª I fell into a burning ring of fire â™ª

884
01:41:57,541 --> 01:42:01,416
â™ª I went down, down, down â™ª

885
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:04,791
â™ª And the flames went higher â™ª

886
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:09,333
â™ª And it burns, burns, burns â™ª

887
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:11,916
â™ª The ring of fire â™ª

888
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:15,333
â™ª The ring of fire â™ª

889
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:35,625
â™ª The taste of love is sweet â™ª

890
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:42,750
â™ª When hearts like ours meet â™ª

891
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:49,875
â™ª I fell for you like a child â™ª

892
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:57,250
â™ª Oh, but the fire went wild â™ª

893
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:05,708
â™ª I fell into a burning ring of fire â™ª

894
01:43:05,791 --> 01:43:09,333
â™ª I went down, down, down â™ª

895
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:12,791
â™ª And the flames went higher â™ª

896
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:17,416
â™ª And it burns, burns, burns â™ª

897
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,083
â™ª The ring of fire â™ª

898
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:23,708
â™ª The ring of fire â™ª
burns â™ª
