1
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,875
[Elodie]
There are many stories of chivalry

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,291
where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.

3
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,958
This is not one of them.

4
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,416
[horses chuffing]

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,333
[tense music playing]

6
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,458
[wings flapping]

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,041
[King] There it is.

8
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,291
Form up!

9
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
Let's kill the beast.

10
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,875
For glory! Hyah!

11
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,333
Be on guard.

12
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,916
[soft cracking]

13
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,958
[dragon snarls]

14
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,041
[swords clanging]

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,375
[dragon roaring]

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,250
Form the line!

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,541
[soldiers breathing shakily]

18
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,500
[dragon snarls, shrieks]

19
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,583
[soldiers screaming]

20
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,791
Hold!

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,333
[wings flapping]

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,291
[soldiers screaming]

23
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,916
[dragon snarls]

24
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,500
[panting]

25
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,791
[grunts]

26
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[Floria] The last I could find.

27
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,916
[Elodie] Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,333
[Floria] This morning.

29
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,541
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

30
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Not the drapes!

31
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,916
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,625
They serve a purpose.

33
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
Floria, our people are freezing.

34
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,541
And starving.

35
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
[carriage driver shouting indistinctly]

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
Who'd come this far north?

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
[Floria] Elodie, why are they leaving?

38
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
[Elodie] There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

39
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,875
[man 1] I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

40
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
[woman 1] For food, join the line!

41
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,541
-[man 2] Keep to one side.
-[man 3] I'm starving.

42
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
All right then.

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,708
[man 4] Get off! It's mine!

44
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,833
-Hey! Give me back my food.
-Get off of me, old man!

45
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
You've had enough!

46
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
[woman 2] Share this
with your sister. Go on.

47
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
-Could you see who it was?
-[guard] A stranger, my lady.

48
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,083
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

49
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,625
-I'll see to it.
-Come on, Flor.

50
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
-[woman 2] Move on.
-[woman 3] Yes.

51
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
-[man 5] Get in line.
-Give it to me.

52
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,666
-[woman] I want to meet her first.
-Father?

53
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
You must be Elodie.

54
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,833
I am.

55
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,833
She will do.

56
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,291
[Lord Bayford sighs softly]

57
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,541
-[Red Priestess] We await your decision.
-Thank you, Your Holiness.

58
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,333
Please, this way.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Father, what's happening?

60
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
Who is that?

61
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,083
[reading indistinctly]

62
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Stepmother?

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, what is it?

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,291
[Lord Bayford] From the Queen of Aurea.

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,166
[chuckles softly]

66
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
A proposal.

67
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,250
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Lord Bayford] Huh…

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
-I have made a match.
-May I?

69
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,791
[Lord Bayford] Uh-huh.

70
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,041
He is a prince.

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
A prince?

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,875
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

73
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,125
Go. See the world.

74
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,291
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

75
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
That's no reason to marry.

76
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
We need this.

77
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,916
Our stores are empty.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,041
We will not make it to the thaw.

79
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,583
Your people need you.

80
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey.

81
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,208
This is who we are.

82
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
[sailor 1] Get to the port side.

83
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,791
[sailor 2] Port side.

84
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,083
[indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
Elodie, what's the matter?

86
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,541
Nothing.

87
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Father says it's natural to be nervous

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

89
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
They're strangers.

90
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

91
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
[sailor 1] Mind the lines.

92
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,666
Oh!

93
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,333
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

94
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,041
Come down here.

95
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,166
Come on.

96
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

97
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,958
Scared, cold as a corpse.

98
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
Nose all drippy and wet.

99
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,666
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

100
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,583
-[both] First impressions are everything.
-Hmm.

101
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,000
[sailor 2] Come on, lift up.

102
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,541
-[exhales sharply]
-[sailor blowing horn]

103
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,125
[sailor 3] Look at that.

104
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,750
I have good news, girls.

105
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

106
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,083
It should be any time now.

107
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,333
[Lord and Lady Bayford chuckle]

108
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,291
Father.

109
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,875
What in the world?

110
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,291
Looks almost… almost like a--

111
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,458
A dragon.

112
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,208
[horn bellowing]

113
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,250
[horn bellowing continues]

114
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,291
-It's okay.
-[Lady Bayford chuckles]

115
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,375
[ethereal music playing]

116
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
[breathes deeply]

117
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
Oh, my heavens. [chuckles]

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,250
[gasps]

119
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
It's magnificent.

120
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,500
My lords, my ladies,

121
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

122
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,958
The royal family is at prayer,

123
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
but word has been sent of your arrival.

124
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

125
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
If you will follow me.

126
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,333
[Floria] Is this a dream?

127
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,291
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

128
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,833
[Lady Bayford shushes]

129
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
If you want these people
to think we belong here,

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,166
you can't act so easily impressed.

131
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

132
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,083
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

133
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,625
[birds chirping]

134
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,458
[chamberlain]
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

135
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,125
A bath has been drawn

136
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
and supper has been carried hence.

137
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

138
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,666
to meet His Royal Highness.

139
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,166
[chuckles softly]

141
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
[Lady Bayford] Floria,
stop touching everything.

142
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,791
Is something wrong?

143
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,250
-I just hope he's kind.
-Hmm.

144
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,500
-And well-read.
-Yeah.

145
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Handsome.

146
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,333
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

147
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,708
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

148
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, indeed.

149
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Come.

150
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,625
[birds chirping]

151
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,375
[maid] M'lady.

152
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Everyone's waiting.

153
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,583
[wind whistling outside]

154
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,166
[sighs]

155
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Ellie?

156
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,625
I can't sleep.

157
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,375
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

158
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,416
You and me both.

159
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

160
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,583
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

161
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,166
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

162
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,333
She means well, even if she is a bit…

163
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
-Exhausting?
-[chuckles]

164
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,333
It'll be fine. You'll see.

165
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

166
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
[Queen Isabelle]
What is your greatest strength?

167
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
[Elodie] I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.

168
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
[Queen Isabelle]
Some might call that a weakness.

169
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
Do you know your heart?

170
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
[Elodie] I believe I do, Your Majesty.

171
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,041
[Queen Isabelle]
And what is it telling you now?

172
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,125
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

173
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,625
[Queen Isabelle] Arise, Elodie.

174
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm Henry.

175
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

176
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,291
We all are.

177
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
My son understates our joy.

178
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
And if I may say so,

179
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,291
your father has understated your beauty.

180
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,500
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
[chuckles] I see she arrives
with some wit.

182
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,083
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

183
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
And you must be Floria.

184
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,666
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

185
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,583
I love your castle.

186
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,041
I mean, I really love it.

187
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Like, a lot…

188
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,875
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,458
You are to make yourself at home, child.

190
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:35,208
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

191
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
[Lord Bayford] Yes…

192
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

193
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,416
you wish to discuss in person.

194
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,333
-The two of us can confer in private.
-Yes.

195
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,625
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

196
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
They have a far more
important task at hand.

197
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
They must get to know each other.

198
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
[Henry] Do you have any questions of me?

199
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
[Elodie] Questions of what subject?

200
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,458
You may choose the subject.

201
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
What do you think about me?

202
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,208
Pardon?

203
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,625
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

204
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,416
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

205
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
truly likes me or not.

206
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,500
[scoffs lightly]

207
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,541
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

208
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,750
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

209
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,916
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Harsh and barren.

211
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
This union will save us.

212
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
I've made my peace with it.

213
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,000
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

214
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Is something wrong?

215
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,375
It's just…

216
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,750
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

217
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,541
[chuckles] Different. In what way?

218
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,625
Far more, um…

219
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,791
flowery.

220
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,500
[both laugh]

221
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,458
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

222
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,958
and my sister's idea was the heart…

223
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,458
-The heart.
-Mmm.

224
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,041
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

225
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,708
You actually drew this?

226
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,041
[chuckles]

227
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,083
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

228
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

229
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,625
That is very clever.

230
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

231
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
-May I ask you another question?
-Certainly.

232
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
Do they always follow you so closely?

233
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
This is them giving me space.

234
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,875
That must be tiring.

235
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,458
It is, actually.

236
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,541
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

237
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,333
Do you ride?

238
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,958
-[horses whinny]
-[riveting music playing]

239
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,583
[Elodie] Hyah!

240
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,416
-Where did you learn to ride like that?
-My mother.

241
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Which way now?

242
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,291
Well, depends on what you want to see.

243
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everything.

244
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Very well.

245
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[doors open]

246
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened in there?

247
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,833
Speak already.

248
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
-Is the wedding still on?
-Aye.

249
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,583
You settled on a fair bride price?

250
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,125
More gold than I could ever imagine.

251
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
[Lady Bayford gasps softly]

252
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
Then why do you look so?

253
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

254
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

255
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,041
No, I did not.

256
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

257
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

258
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

259
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,333
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

260
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Torches.

261
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,166
You saw that?

262
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
I couldn't sleep.

263
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,125
It was an ancient ceremony.

264
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
Or rather, one of three.

265
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,541
They're very significant to my family.

266
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um…

267
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
They honor our ancestors.

268
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

269
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
[Elodie] It is quite beautiful.

270
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,833
[Henry] Yes, I suppose.

271
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,416
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

272
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,125
May I confide in you something?

273
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,041
Yes.

274
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,791
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

275
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,583
Really set out and see it, you know?

276
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,375
I do, actually.

277
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
It's my life's dream.

278
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,708
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

279
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,208
The ones you only read about.

280
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,500
[Elodie chuckles softly]

281
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,166
Perhaps, one day, we will.

282
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
Perhaps.

283
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
[bell tolling]

284
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[woman] And the orange in this area.

285
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,000
[Lady Bayford]
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

286
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,666
Well, I'm glad you approve.

287
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
Very elegant.

288
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,750
You have impeccable taste.

289
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Everything is just so exquisite.

290
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

291
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,750
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

292
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,708
seeing as we're about to be family.

293
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,333
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

294
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,416
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

295
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,208
The finest in the city.

296
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,958
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

297
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

298
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,875
Nor place undue import

299
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,708
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

300
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh… "Necessity"?

301
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,208
Well, your family needs money.

302
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,458
My family needs a bride.

303
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,791
What we don't need is more family.

304
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,583
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

305
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,000
-I merely--
-Elodie.

306
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Pardon?

307
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,416
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

308
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I said.

309
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,291
Good day, Lady Bayford.

310
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,250
It's perfect.

311
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,833
Everything in here is so perfect.

312
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,125
[Elodie] Stepmother.

313
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,250
Is something the matter?

314
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,666
Elodie,

315
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,041
I know we haven't always been close,

316
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,791
but I need you to listen to me now.

317
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
This wedding… is a mistake.

318
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,708
[scoffs] What?

319
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't understand.

320
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
These people, I don't trust them.

321
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,041
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

322
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,250
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

323
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,291
Floria.

324
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,458
I was wrong.

325
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,750
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

326
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,000
[Elodie] Well…

327
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,208
-What does Father think?
-He refuses to talk about it.

328
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,458
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

329
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,250
-Because you're being unreasonable.
-That's enough, Flor.

330
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:10,000
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

331
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,000
Am I interrupting something?

332
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,750
No.

333
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,500
Just…

335
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:30,416
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

336
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,125
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

337
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,541
Time for what?

338
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,041
[Lady Bayford] I hope you know
what you're doing.

339
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,916
Good night, my angels.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,708
-Good night, Father.
-Good night, Father.

341
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,833
Good night.

342

[Floria] Wow.

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
[serene music playing]

350
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,583
[priest] You may kiss the bride.

351
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,458
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

352
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:36,125
[guests applaud, cheer]

353
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,166
Goodbye, Father.

354
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,833
[softly] I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

355
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,250
Twice as beautiful.

356
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,291
-I love you.
-I love you.

357
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey! Hey, hey!

358
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,125
[Elodie] Where are we going?

359
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,416
[Henry] Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

360
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,333
[Elodie] Yes.

361
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,333
[Henry] We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

362
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,583
[wind whistles]

363
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,666
Welcome, Princess.

364
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,083
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

365
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,500
to protect our people.

366
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,083
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

367
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,458
So, tonight,

368
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:22,041
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

369
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

370
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,208
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

371
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,458
A creature dwelt here first.

372
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,083
The last of its kind.

373
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,208
With savage bloodlust,

374
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,750
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

375
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,166
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

376
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,375
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

377
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,791
and each man met his end.

378
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,041
Each save one.

379
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,500
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

380
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,166
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

381
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,625
A cruel torture.

382
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,791
He adored his daughters,

383
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,041
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

384
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,500
And so, a pact was made.

385
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,958
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

386
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,625
and a kingdom was born.

387
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,916
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

388
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,416
A tradition going back centuries.

389
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,083
Your hand, child.

390
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:07,708
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

391
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,458
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

392
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,375
She is now of royal blood.

393
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,791
[inhales sharply, exhales]

394
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,583
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

395
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,791
pay your due to the realm.

396
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,208
[softly] Toss the coin into the chasm.

397
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,041
The ceremony is now complete.

398
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,916
You may make your return.

399
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,583
I'm supposed to carry you back.

400
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm fine with walking, really.

401
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,875
Floria would love this part.

402
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,916
Close your eyes.

403
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,125
I've got you.

404
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,416
[Henry breathing shakily]

405

I want… what is promised.

What is owed.

They said you set upon their village.

That the king came
only to defend his people.

Your kind were never innocent.

Then go ahead.

All of us did.

That is how they make us royal.

That is the blood you smell.

They fooled you.

You've been killing

She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

That's enough, Henry.

You know nothing of our story.

847
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,000
Take your family

848
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,166
and run.

849
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,541
[man] Come. Let's go.

850
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:21,833
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

851
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,166
No?

852
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,750
You insolent creature.

853
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,541
You think we ought to fear you now?

854
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:39,791
Why?

855
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:43,750
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

856
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,708
It's not me you should fear.

857
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,291
This is the end of your story.

858
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
[woman] Run!

859
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,416
-[woman] It's the dragon!
-[man] Run!

860
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:16,125
[roars]

861
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:42,833
No!

862
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,125
[sailor 1] Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

863
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,875
[sailor 2] Let's be sharp there, lads.

864
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,125
[Lady Bayford] You can't be serious.

865
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,083
[Elodie] But I am.

866
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,916
We'll run it together.

867
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,583
We've got a bounty of supplies.

868
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,041
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

869
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,166
Oh, Elodie.

870
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,458
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

871
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,500
Can I help too?

872
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,625
Floria.

873
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:02,791
I'm counting on it.

874
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,541
[Floria] Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

875
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,208
[Lady Bayford] Oh, wide heavens!

876
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:19,458
[sailor] My lady,
what course shall we steer?

877
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Home.

878
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:35,125
