KIM SU-YEONG

2
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,037
We have to walk from here.

3
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
Yeong-su.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,855
We have to go.

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,733
We have to take Su-yeong.

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,069
She can't come.

7
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,361
Then I'm not going!

8
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,781
Yeong-su…

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,825
I'll also die anyway.

10
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,870
You'll turn into a monster too!

11
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,372
That's not true.

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,208
Why would I?

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,542
Go away!

14
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,461
I'm staying with Su-yeong!

15
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,796
Go!

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,172
Let go!

17
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,257
Let go of me!

18
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,051
I'm not going!

19
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,574
I said I'm not going!

20
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,827
Su-yeong!

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,287
Su-yeong!

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,582
Take Su-yeong with us!

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,377
Take her with us!

24
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,546
Su-yeong!

25
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,341
I said I'm not going!

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,094
Su-yeong!

27
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,931
Su-yeong!

28
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,934
Su-yeong…

SWEET HOME

BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU

32
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,526
Damn it.

33
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,258
I would've cooperated
if you had just asked me.

34
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,969
I don't have much time.

35
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,224
That briefcase looks familiar.

36
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,267
Aren't you glad?

37
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,436
I know it's very important to you.

38
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,646
Yes, I am.

39
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,857
You actually managed to find it.

40
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,943
Where did you find it?

41
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,322
Did you kill the person who had it?

42
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,240
I assume they paid their price.

43
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,283
Why?

44
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,202
Do you know this person?

45
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,495
Of course not.

46
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,290
You all know how upset I was
when I lost this.

47
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,793
Open it up.

48
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,045
Why?

49
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,799
What, are you going to use it?

50
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,301
Just for you guys?

51
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,637
Shut up and open it!

52
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,556
The Central Command's safety
is crucial for the country's future!

53
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,309
Pretty fancy way to say you're scared.

54
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,771
I didn't say I wouldn't.

55
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
Sure you won't regret it?

56
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,246
You said it stops monsterization.
That's been confirmed.

57
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,041
In a broad sense, yes.

58
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,752
But there's still some figuring out to do.

59
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,381
And I feel kind of pressured
by all the anticipation--

60
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,924
Your job was simply

61
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,219
to create what's in the case.

62
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,013
Of course.

63
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,311
Here we go.

64
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,545
What the hell?

65
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,548
Is this your doing?

66
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,219
Where did you hide it?

67
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,764
A safe place.

68
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,059
Somewhere you could never…

69
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
find it.

70
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,691
Hey, kid.

71
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,276
Wake up.

72
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,529
Come on, wake up.

73
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,460
You'll have to excuse me here.

74
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,171
Aren't you coming with us?

75
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,384
I'm a soldier.
I have to return to my base.

76
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,676
You're going back?

77
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,553
Come with us.

78
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,390
You could just ditch your uniform.

79
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,891
They're not going to come for you.

80
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,142
Don't say that.

81
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,978
Desertion is a serious crime.

82
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,732
I'll talk to the soldiers here
and figure something out.

83
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,508
Keep moving in an orderly fashion.

84
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,679
Pull your mask down
so we can check for symptoms.

85
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,014
You have to put that down.

86
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,641
Get your hands off me.

87
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Put it down.

88
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,478
Let go.

89
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,480
Grab him. Check his bag.

90
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,149
It's a gun, sir!

91
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,025
Put him in isolation.

92
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,528
Get over here.

93
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,740
-Let go, you assholes!
-Get over here.

94
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,292
Get him out of here.

95
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,511
Come on. Move it.

96
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,513
Keep moving.

97
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm Private Park Chan-yeong
from the 7th Division, 9th Regiment.

98
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,482
I left the base during an operation.

99
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,858
I'll wait for your orders.

100
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,860
Black Kite, we have a returning soldier.

101
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,904
He's Private Park Chan-yeong
from the 7th Division, 9th Regiment.

102
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,409
PITCHER

BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU
RESTRICTED MILITARY AREA

104
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,799
What's going on?

105
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,926
Sergeant First Class Lee Gi-baek…

106
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,888
and Staff Sergeant Kim Dae-un…

107
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,349
are dead.

108
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,893
They could've lived.

109
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,354
But those motherfuckers…

110
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,024
didn't do anything to help them.

111
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,236
They told us to go to the shelter.

112
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,240
What the hell does that mean?

113
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,534
They're getting us fucking discharged.

114
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,078
As of 12:00 p.m. today,

115
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,748
the whole platoon is to be discharged.

116
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,627
You established the unit yourself,
Brigadier General Han.

117
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,378
You said…

118
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,048
you would never turn your back on us.

119
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,884
That's why we responded to your call.

120
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,136
You're right.

121
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,597
I did say that.

122
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,643
Why are you doing this?

123
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,067
We no longer need the Crow Platoon.

124
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,986
We keep wiping them out,

125
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,280
but there's always more.

126
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,157
So?

127
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,285
Have you given up?

128
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,541
No, I made a choice.

129
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,336
Master Sergeant Tak.

130
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,464
In-hwan.

131
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,467
Be a deserter.

132
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,553
The nation's never thanked you
for your service.

133
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,555
Grab some weapons and food

134
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,266
and get out of here with your men.

135
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,228
You want us…

136
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,231
to dishonor ourselves
and go to the shelter?

137
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,148
No.

138
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,775
Not there.

139
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,695
You can't go there.

140
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,827
What are you hiding, sir?

141
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,380
SHELTER ADMISSION PROTOCOL

142
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,132
1. CHECK TEMPERATURE
2. CHECK FOR MONSTERIZATION SYMPTOMS

143
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,228
Move.

144
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
What?

145
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,498
Do it one more time. It must be a mistake.

146
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,750
It's a mistake! I'm not sick!

147
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,877
Let go!

148
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,504
I'm clean! Let go of me!

149
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,964
Fucking let go of me!

150
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,674
-Let go! I'm clean!
-Open the gate!

151
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,928
Open the gate!

152
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,763
-I want out!
-What the hell?

153
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,515
Open up, you assholes!

154
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,893
NOT ADMISSIBLE

155
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,400
Have you had a nosebleed
or a fever recently?

156
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,506
Look at me.

157
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,261
Look at me.

158
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,199
This is an announcement
regarding an update in protocol.

159
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,035
We will no longer be screening survivors.

160
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,454
Please enter in an orderly fashion.

161
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,538
I repeat.

162
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,249
We will no longer be screening survivors.

163
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,127
Please enter in an orderly fashion.

164
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,354
Bang Jin-ho.

165
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,940
Yes, sir.

166
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,567
Aren't you going home?

167
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,659
I haven't heard
from Master Sergeant Tak yet.

168
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,163
That Master Sergeant Tak
who doesn't care about his men's deaths?

169
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,793
Don't talk about him like that, sir.

170
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,711
What?

171
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,675
We're from different units,
but we're in the same one now.

172
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,802
I acknowledge you as my superior.

173
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,972
So please do the same
for Master Sergeant Tak.

174
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,723
Stop being an idiot.

175
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,819
I know you look up to him.

176
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,989
But he doesn't deserve it.

177
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,659
Because people say
he murdered his own family?

178
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,453
That's only a rumor.

179
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

180
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,083
Because in my eyes,

181
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,254
he seems like he's capable of it.

182
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,597
Tell me.

183
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,516
Where did you hide it?

184
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,518
Why would I tell you?

185
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,228
I went through so much to hide it.

186
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,941
You must not value your life.

187
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,319
Like you're going to kill me.

188
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,987
I know where the vaccine is.

189
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,574
Why don't we forget about it all
and start over?

190
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,285
You can't fool me again.

191
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,829
I gave you more than enough time.

192
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,956
How dare you
repay my generosity like this?

193
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,249
I told you.

194
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,168
I don't have much time!

195
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,211
Mr. Prime Minister!

196
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,178
That's only the beginning, Dr. Lim.

197
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,348
Let's not waste any more energy, okay?

198
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,769
Now, tell me.

199
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,854
Where did you hide it?

200
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,238
What are you hiding, sir?

201
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,299
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT
TOP SECRET

202
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,315
Sergeant Kim.

203
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,984
The Crow Platoon's being summoned.

204
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,321
What's going on?

205
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,405
Kim Yeong-hu.

206
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,824
I made up my mind.

207
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,909
Get your head on straight from now on.

208
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,583
About your theory, Dr. Lim.

209
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,171
If monsterization is a natural phenomenon
as you suggested,

210
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,300
I realized that it won't stop

211
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,137
until all of mankind

212
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,556
is dead and gone.

213
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,185
That's why I have a gift for you.

214
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,689
If you don't disappoint me, that is.

215
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,693
What the hell are you going to do?

216
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,531
Clean up.

217
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,668
PLEASE COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY
TO RESTORE ORDER AND SAFETY

218
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,046
We'll clean them out
before they turn into monsters.

219
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,966
Then the world will be clean
for the time being…

220
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,053
and it might put an end
to this catastrophe.

221
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,723
What should I do, Dr. Lim?

222
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,229
Why are you laughing?

223
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
I love it.

224
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,778
That's exactly…

225
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,907
what I wanted.

226
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,576
This is what I wanted to do.

227
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,870
We should've cleaned up regularly!

228
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,788
Everyone…

229
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,124
Everyone lived in peace for too long.

230
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,667
That's why this happened.

231
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,345
What are you waiting for?

232
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,138
Do it.

233
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,556
Clean up.

234
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,600
What about you then?

235
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,269
I'll tell you

236
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,980
where to find what you want.

237
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,235
Sure.

238
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,779
Let's do some cleaning.

239
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,832
What the hell?

240
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,333
Why are those flying this way?

241
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,960
There must be a mistake.

242
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,670
It's coming.

243
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,046
It's coming!

244
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,703
Ji-su!

245
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,705
Ji-su!

246
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,874
Yoon Ji-su!

247
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,056
Ji-su!

248
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,940
Ji-su!

249
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,112
Ji-su!

250
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,350
You're not going to talk, are you?

251
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,108
It's going to take some time,

252
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,318
but I'll eventually find it.

253
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,196
No, you'll never find it.

254
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,658
There's a problem I haven't solved yet.

255
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,452
It's too bad, Mr. Prime Minister.

256
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,249
Goodbye then.

257
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,613
Move, Jong-hyun!

258
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,812
It's done, sir.

259
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,158
We'll blow up the isolation area first.

260
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,827
The rest of you, grab the medical supplies

261
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,412
and get ready to head to the shelter.

262
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,464
What do you desire?

263
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,301
I don't know.

264
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,304
Do you think you can resist it?

265
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,392
What happened to your family?

266
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,311
They all died.

267
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,646
Did you kill them?

268
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,941
Have you killed a human before?

269
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,318
Why did you kill… What do you desire?

270
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,821
-Stop it.
-What happened to… Did you kill them?

271
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,281
So what are you now?

272
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,241
Are you human?

273
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,911
Or are you a monster?

274
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm talking to you.

275
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,418
Answer me.

276
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,565
How did you like it here?

277
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,903
Was it better than you thought?

278
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,949
Or was it hell?

279
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,290
You set out to help mankind…

280
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,043
and look how you ended up.

281
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,003
Isn't it pathetic?

282
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
What do you think I'll do to you?

283
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,802
Will I rescue you again?

284
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,555
Or will I kill you this time?

285
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,435
It's neither.

286
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm going to abandon you.

287
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,773
Stay locked up

288
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,733
and watch this place crumble

289
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,152
with your own eyes.

290
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,723
Wake up, Jung Ui-myeong.

291
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,325
Just admit it.

292
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,119
You're a monster.

293
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,539
Yes.

294
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,042
I am a monster.

295
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,939
I told you it was pointless.

296
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,942
I gave you another chance

297
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,944
because it was your first time.

298
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
But you threw it away.

299
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,785
You tricked me into
doing some stupid shit.

300
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,745
But not anymore.

301
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,622
Not anymore.

302
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,999
Not anymore, god damn it.

303
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,574
You don't deserve to be a neohuman.

304
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,821
Wither away here.

305
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,825
No.

306
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,662
Realize that there's no human…

307
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,376
who will come save you or you can protect.

308
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,388
Live in despair.

309
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,223
All alone.

310
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,310
Unable to…

311
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,024
die.

312
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,085
No…

313
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,099
Yeong-su.

314
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,393
Yeong-su.

315
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,978
Wake up.

316
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,232
Good.

317
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,449
Get up.

318
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
Okay. Go.

319
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,076
Go.

320
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,538
Hurry.

321
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,417
Hurry, Yeong-su.

322
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,752
Go on.

323
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,879
Go!

324
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,589
Hurry, Yeong-su!

325
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,093
Stand up!

326
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,014
Go!

327
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,559
Get away, Yeong-su!

328
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,895
Hurry up!

329
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,396
Hurry!

330
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,232
Yeong-su, please. Just go!

331
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,026
Go!

332
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,153
Hurry up and go!

333
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,988
Please, Yeong-su.

334
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:10,906
Hurry.

335
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,741
-Go!
-Ji-su…

336
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,993
-Go!
-Yoon Ji-su!

337
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,161
Yoon Ji-su!

338
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,372
Yeong-su, please.

339
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,044
Yeong-su, please.

340
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,712
Go already, Yeong-su!

341
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,838
Just go!

342
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,590
Hurry up!

343
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,189
Yoon Ji-su!

344
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,610
Yoon Ji-su!

345
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,487
Yoon Ji-su!

346
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,250
No, Ji-su!

347
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,920
Please, no!

348
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,922
No!

349
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,259
Ji-su!

350
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,847
No.

351
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,474
No! Please!

352
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,602
No! Ji-su!

353
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,567
No!

354
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,070
No…

355
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,786
Yoon Ji-su!

356
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,796
This will be our base camp.

357
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,339
We don't know what could get in.

358
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,008
Seal off all the exits.

359
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,676
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

360
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,766
How are we going to secure food?

361
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,810
We don't even have water.

362
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,479
We can always find some.

363
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,357
We'll go out as soon as
things are sorted out.

364
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,613
Don't move!

365
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,530
Wait.

366
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,919
How many of you are here?

367
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,837
About 400.

368
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,715
Okay, we'll be able to accommodate them.
