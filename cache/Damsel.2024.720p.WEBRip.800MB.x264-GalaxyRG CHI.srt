Welcome, Princess.

364
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,125
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

365
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,542
to protect our people.

366
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:13,125
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

367
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,500
So, tonight,

368
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:22,083
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

369
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:29,000
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

370
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,250
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

371
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,500
A creature dwelt here first.

372
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,125
The last of its kind.

373
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,250
With savage bloodlust,

374
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,792
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

375
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,208
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

376
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,417
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

377
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,833
and each man met his end.

378
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,083
Each save one.

379
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,542
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

380
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:10,208
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

381
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,667
A cruel torture.

382
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,833
He adored his daughters,

383
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,083
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

384
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,542
And so, a pact was made.

385
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:26,000
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

386
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,667
and a kingdom was born.

387

It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

388
